        "text": "ulmonary bypass. Desmopressin acetate is used to reduce blood loss after cardiac surgery. However, there have been reports that hypotension can occur with infusion of desmopressin and that postoperative blood loss is not reduced. In this randomized, double-blinded study, we investigated the effects of desmopressin on hemodynamics, coagulation, and postoperative blood loss in patients undergoing primary elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After reversal of heparin effect, 20 patients received desmopressin 0.3 micrograms.kg-1, infused over 15 min, and 20 patients received a placebo. Desmopressin produced a small but significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure when compared with the placebo (50.8 mmHg vs. 57.6 mmHg for the desmopressin- and placebo-treated groups, respectively; P = 0.0372). A 20% or greater decrease in mean arterial pressure was observed in 7 of 20 patients receiving desmopressin, whereas only one patient in the placebo-treated group experienced a decrease of this magnitude (P = 0.0177). Reductions in arterial pressure were secondary to decreases in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (mean SVR before and after the drug infusion, 1,006 and 766 dyn.s.cm-5, respectively, for the desmopressin-treated group; and 994 and 1,104 dyn.s.cm-5, respectively, for the placebo-treated group; P = 0.0078). \nHypertension following erythropoietin therapy in anemic hemodialysis patients. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) corrects the anemia of end-stage renal disease. However, hypertension has been observed as an adverse effect of increasing red cell mass. In our study, 44 of 63 patients (70%) treated with rHuEpo had an increase in mean arterial pressure greater than 10 mm Hg or required new or additional hypertensive medications. Retrospective analysis disclosed that increasing blood pressure was associated with pretreatment hematocrit level less than or equal to 0.20 (P = .05) and dependency on red cell transfusions (P less than .01). Factors not associated with hypertension included the rate of rise of the hematocrit, the net rise in hematocrit, age, sex, the number of years on dialysis, the presence or absence of kidneys, smoking, or the presence of pretreatment hypertension. Noninvasive hemodynamic studies in eight normotensive patients before and after improvement of the anemia demonstrated a normalization of the decreased peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction toward normal in the elevated cardiac output. In three of these patients, clinical hypertension subsequently evolved. Follow-up hemodynamic studies in nine other patients receiving new or additional antihypertensive medications were difficult to interpret. Although the hypertension can be controlled with routine medication, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur if the blood pressure increases rapidly when the hematocrit increases with rHuEpo therapy. \nPrevalence of Type A behavior in untreated hypertensive individuals. Type A behavior has been associated with coronary heart disease as well as high cholesterol and smoking, major risk factors for coronary heart disease, but the data indicating a similar association with hypertension are inconsistent. Since past studies have usually based hypertension on a single blood pressure assessment or have often included treated hypertensive patients, this inconsistency is not surprising. The current study compared the prevalence of Type A behavior (assessed by Rosenman's structured interview) between 109 untreated hypertensive subjects and 109 age-, sex-, ethnic-, and occupation-matched normotensive subjects. Hypertension status was based on five repeated assessments over a 5-month period. Results indicated that Type A behavior is more prevalent in untreated, mildly hypertensive employed individuals than occupationally matched normotensive subjects. Type A component analysis confirmed the importance of hostility and certain vigorous voice stylistics in predicting cardiovascular conditions. These findings, taken together with the evidence linking Type A behavior with high cholesterol and cigarette smoking, further support the view that this behavior pattern is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. \nNeuronal activity up-regulates astroglial gene expression. Neuronal gene expression is known to be modulated by functional activity. This modulation is thought to play a key role in determining the differentiation of developing neurons and regulating the operation of mature neurons. Here we describe a regulation of astroglial gene expression by neuronal activity. We report that intense neuronal activity (electrically induced seizures) in rat hippocampus leads to rapid and dramatic increases in mRNA for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astroglia-specific intermediate filament protein. GFAP mRNA levels increased at sites of stimulation as well as in areas that were synaptically activated by the resultant seizures. When seizures were induced repetitively for many days, levels of GFAP mRNA remained chronically elevated. However, GFAP mRNA returned to control levels within a few days after the cessation of stimulation. The coupling between astroglial gene expression and neuronal activity may be a mechanism through which neuronal activity modulates the function of supporting cells that are responsible for regulating the extracellular microenvironment of the brain. \nImplications of obesity for cardiovascular disease in blacks: the CARDIA and ARIC studies [published erratum appears in Am J Clin Nutr 1991 Sep;54(3):590] To examine the relation of obesity to cardiovascular disease in blacks, we analyzed data from two population studies, including young and middle-aged adults. Obesity, defined by using the sum of subscapular and triceps skinfold measurements, was positively associated with atherogenic plasma lipids, systolic blood pressure, serum glucose and insulin, and prevalence of diabetes mellitus. The strength of these associations, for the most part, was similar in blacks and whites. However, with each unit increase in sum of skinfold thicknesses, plasma triglyceride concentrations in blacks appeared to increase only one-third to one-half as much as in whites. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease in 45- to 65-y-old blacks was associated with obesity; the odds ratio (95% confidence interval), adjusted for age and cigarette smoking, was 1.3 (0.9, 1.8) in both black men and black women. Additional analyses showed that abdominal adiposity conferred increased risk. These findings suggest that both blacks and whites should avoid excess adiposity. \nUsefulness of technetium-99m-MIBI and thallium-201 in tomographic imaging combined with high-dose dipyridamole and handgrip exercise for detecting coronary artery disease Forty-two patients with known stable coronary artery disease, referred for coronary angiography, were examined with technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxy-2-methylpropyl-isonitrile (MIBI) tomography combined with a high-dose dipyridamole infusion (0.7 mg/kg) and handgrip stress. MIBI tomography was unable to show coronary artery disease only in 2 patients, thus yielding a sensitivity figure of 95%. MIBI tomography correctly identified 27 (82%) of 33 stenotic lesions (greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis) of the left anterior descending artery, 17 (61%) of 28 of those of the left circumflex artery, and 28 (90%) of 31 of those of the right coronary artery. The overall vessel sensitivity was 78%. The computed lumen diameter stenoses were more advanced in cases detected than in those not detected with MIBI tomography: 87 +/- 14 vs 76 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01). The 50 to 69% stenoses did not show any tendency to produce less positive findings than those with greater than or equal to 70% stenoses. In the subgroup of 21 patients who also presented for thallium scintigraphy, the overall diseased vessel identification rate was 76% for thallium tomography and 83% for MIBI tomography (p = not significant). Minor noncardiac side effects related to the dipyridamole-handgrip test occurred only in 5% of 63 study sessions. A high-dose dipyridamole combined with isometric exercise is a safe stress method, and when used during scintigraphy, MIBI tomography is at least as efficient a tool as thallium tomography in detecting diseased vessel territories in patients in coronary artery disease. \nElevated circulating interleukin-6 is associated with an acute-phase response but reduced fixed hepatic protein synthesis in patients with cancer. It has been suggested that, as part of the inflammatory response to the presence of a tumor, various cytokines are produced and these induce hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins (APP). Under these circumstances it is not known what changes occur in the fixed component of hepatic protein synthesis. The aim of this study was to compare circulating interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) concentrations and fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates in a group of healthy controls (n = 6) with a group of patients with an established APP response secondary to hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer (n = 6). Fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates were measured following a primed, constant 20-hour infusion of 15N-glycine. The liver was biopsied at laparotomy. The APP response was assessed by serum C-reactive protein concentration and cytokines were assayed by a combination of immunoassay and bioassay. The patients with advanced cancer and an on-going APP response had elevated circulating IL-6 concentrations (p less than 0.01). Rates of fixed hepatic protein synthesis were 30% lower than those observed in controls (p less than 0.01). These findings demonstrate that in patients with hepatic metastasis, although the synthesis of certain acute-phase export proteins can be increased, fixed protein synthesis is reduced. Whether these changes in the distribution of hepatic protein synthesis are mediated by IL-6 will require further investigation. \nIncreasing incidence of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The incidence of pyloric stenosis in the Mersey region rose from 1.54/1000 births in 1976-8 to 2.22/1000 births in 1986-8. Reliance on ultrasonography for diagnosis in the 1980s resulted in fewer 'tumours' being felt; diagnostic delay was not shortened overall but serial ultrasonography showed evolving lesions in six patients. Clinical examination and selective use of ultrasonography is advocated. \nBrachial plexus anesthesia in pediatric patients. Between 1980 and 1988 at our institution, brachial plexus anesthesia (BPA) was used in 109 pediatric patients who underwent 142 surgical procedures on an upper extremity, including 134 axillary blocks. Most patients older than 6 years of age had their blocks and surgical procedures with moderate sedation. The success rate was high--92.4% of axillary blocks and 100% of other blocks were adequate for surgical intervention in patients who required only intravenous sedation. The postoperative course in the BPA group was compared with that in 109 age-matched control subjects who underwent 188 procedures on an upper extremity during general anesthesia (GA). Admission to the recovery room after anesthesia occurred less frequently in the BPA group than in the GA group (27.5% versus 91.0%; P less than 0.01). Furthermore, nausea and vomiting were less frequent in the BPA group than in the GA group (P less than 0.01). Outpatients in the BPA group were less likely to require narcotic analgesics before dismissal than were those in the GA group (12% versus 31%; P less than 0.05). Admission of outpatients was infrequent in both groups (2% for BPA and 9% for GA). No significant difference was noted in 24-hour postoperative narcotic requirements between the BPA and GA groups. \nMechanism of production of scoliosis. A hypothesis. On the basis of previous studies on the vertebral column and thoracic skeleton, the author generated a hypothesis for the mechanism of production of scoliosis. According to this hypothesis, vertical stability of the thoracic spine is maintained by equal support through the ribs from both sides due to the equal load brought to the lamin by both the ribs through the costotransverse articulations and ligaments. Any interference in this balancing mechanism will disturb the mechanism of spinal stability, and the spine will bend toward the more heavier loaded side at the intervertebral joints. On the basis of this hypothesis, mechanisms of production of scoliosis (both in experimental animals and humans) after removal of ribs on one side can be explained. Removal of the ribs from one side produces an imbalance in the symmetric weight transmission through the ribs on the two sides. Pathologic deformations within the vertebrae in scoliosis results from the asymmetric load and the altered route of the load transmission on the convex side of the curve. \nVentricular cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia in children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. To determine the significance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) eosinophilia, the charts of 106 patients treated with shunt-related procedures during the calendar year 1985 were reviewed. Sixty-nine patients presented for a shunt revision; their charts were retrospectively reviewed from the time of shunt insertion until January, 1988. The remaining 37 patients had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted during the study period and were subsequently followed to January, 1988. A total of 558 shunt-related procedures were performed on these patients during the study period, with a mean follow-up period of 6.9 years. The infection rate was 3.8%. Eosinophilia was diagnosed when eosinophils accounted for 8% or more of the total CSF white blood cell count. Ventricular CSF eosinophilia occurred in 36 patients sometime during their clinical course. These 36 patients required a mean of 8.5 shunt revisions, while the remaining patients required a mean of 2.5 revisions (p less than 0.001). Shunt infections were also more frequent in patients with eosinophilia (p less than 0.01). In no case was peripheral eosinophilia or a parasitic infection present. This study demonstrates that CSF eosinophilia is common in children with shunts. Children with this laboratory finding will experience more shunt failures. In addition, the new appearance of eosinophilia in the CSF of a patient with a shunt in place suggests the possibility of a shunt infection. \nDrug-induced fever due to diltiazem. To our knowledge, drug-induced fever has not been reported with the use of diltiazem hydrochloride, a commonly prescribed calcium channel blocker. We describe a patient in whom this was the primary manifestation of drug hypersensitivity. A 67-year-old man was admitted for management of a diabetic foot ulcer. His hospital course was complicated by a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, for which diltiazem was prescribed. On the seventh day of therapy, he experienced fever, with temperatures as high as 38.8 degrees C. Despite an extensive evaluation, which included a gallium scan, a technetium bone scan, and abdominal ultrasound, a source could not be found. On the 16th day of therapy, however, relative eosinophilia developed, and 2 days later a pruritic maculopapular rash appeared. Diltiazem therapy was discontinued, leading to resolution of fever within 48 hours. Drug-induced fever should be considered in patients who have unexplained high temperatures during diltiazem therapy. \nSurvival of patients with metastases from uveal melanoma. The authors evaluated a series of 145 consecutive patients with metastases from uveal melanoma, after proton beam irradiation, to assess the effect of early diagnosis and treatment for metastases on survival. Metastases were diagnosed between 7 weeks and 8.3 years (median, 2.4 years) after proton beam irradiation. Most patients (n = 94) were symptomatic before diagnosis; the remainder were first detected during screening examination. Liver involvement was documented in nearly all patients (n = 136). The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma. \nPharyngeal pouch carcinoma: two unusual cases. Two patients with carcinomata arising in pharyngeal pouches are reported. In one, the tumour was detected preoperatively by a contrast radiographic study. In the second the lesion was a carcinoma in situ. The English literature is reviewed with reference to these two unusual features. \nCarpal tunnel syndrome, subclinical median mononeuropathy, and peripheral polyneuropathy: common early complications of chronic peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Nerve conduction velocity studies were done in median, ulnar, and peroneal nerves, one time each in 46 patients who had been on chronic peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis for varying lengths of time. Only six patients had normal findings; 37 had peripheral polyneuropathy (15 had isolated polyneuropathy; 22 had median nerve dysfunction in addition); 16 had subclinical median mononeuropathy (14 with polyneuropathy, two without); and nine had overt carpal tunnel syndrome (eight with polyneuropathy, one without). Abnormalities were present in seven of the 11 patients studied after one year of dialysis and in 19 of the 24 patients studied after two years of dialysis. Seventeen patients studied after five years of dialysis all had polyneuropathy. Nine patients studied after seven years of dialysis all had median nerve dysfunction. Abnormalities were as common with peritoneal dialysis as with hemodialysis. Nerve dysfunction was independent of the disease underlying renal failure, the side of the dialysis access shunt, and the presence or absence of osteodystrophy. Dialysis patients need frequent nerve conduction studies from the onset of dialysis to identify carpal tunnel syndrome early and to avoid irreversible nerve damage. \nDetection of preclinical Parkinson's disease with PET. Putamen 18F-dopa uptake of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms; therefore, positron-emission tomography (PET) can be used to detect preclinical disease in clinically unaffected twins and relatives of patients with PD. Three out of 6 monozygotic and 2 out of 3 dizygotic unaffected PD co-twins have shown reduced putamen 18F-dopa uptake to date. In addition, an intact sibling and a daughter of 1 of 4 siblings with PD both had low putamen 18F-dopa uptake. These preliminary findings suggest there may be a familial component to the etiology of PD. PET can also be used to detect underlying nigral pathology in patients with isolated tremor and patients who become rigid taking dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Patients with familial essential tremor have normal, and those with isolated rest tremor have consistently low, putamen 18F-dopa uptake. Drug-induced parkinsonism is infrequently associated with underlying nigral pathology. \nEffects of relief of biliary obstruction on mononuclear phagocyte system function and cell mediated immunity. Obstructive jaundice causes depression of immune system function but it is unclear at present how rapidly immune function recovers after relief of biliary obstruction. To address this issue, we studied 218 Sprague-Dawley rats with common bile duct obstruction. Mononuclear phagocyte function, cell mediated immune function, portal-systemic shunt fraction, liver function tests, and liver histology were evaluated in normal (sham) rats, obstructed rats, and at weekly intervals after relief of biliary obstruction. Hepatic uptake of radiolabelled bacteria was 82 per cent in sham rats and 66 per cent in rats 21 days after CBD obstruction (P less than 0.05). Phagocytic activity returned to normal within 7 days after choledochoduodenostomy. Cell mediated immunity, measured by skin graft rejection, was significantly prolonged in the obstructed group (P less than 0.05) but had returned to normal 7 days after biliary diversion. Return of hepatocellular function, as measured by liver function tests, paralleled recovery of immune function. This study demonstrates prompt recovery of the immune system after internal biliary drainage for obstructive jaundice. This finding is in contrast to previous studies that demonstrated persistent immune suppression months after biliary diversion. These data may have implications concerning the usefulness of internal biliary drainage before surgery in patients with obstructive jaundice. \nProgressive supranuclear palsy: altered sensory processing leads to degraded cognition. We studied the latencies, amplitudes, and scalp distributions of the early and late components of the event-related brain potential (ERP) in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and matched normal controls. In separate choice reaction time (RT) tasks, the subjects pressed buttons to visual stimuli presented randomly at probabilities of either 20/80 or 50/50. Compared with normal controls, PSP patients had significantly reduced amplitudes and increased latencies for both the visual P2 and P300 components at all levels of probability. RTs and percent errors were significantly greater in the patients compared with controls. Neither the amplitude nor latency of the visual N1 component was significantly altered in these patients. There were no significant group differences in the distribution of electrical activity over the scalp for any of these ERP components, a finding which suggests that the neural structures responsible for generating these potentials were intact in these patients. The decreased ERP component amplitudes and increased ERP component latencies, combined with intact scalp distributions and increased RTs and error rates, present a pattern of results suggesting that the stimulus identification or categorization processes in these patients are significantly degraded. \nGastric emptying after gastric interposition for cancer of the esophagus or hypopharynx. Transhiatal esophagectomy with primary anastomosis to the stomach (gastric pull-up) is an attractive surgical alternative to colic interposition in patients with cancer of the esophagus and hypopharynx. However, the lack of intrinsic gastric peristalsis and complaints by patients of postprandial regurgitation prompted us to measure the effect of body posture on the rates of gastric emptying in these patients. The rates of solid and liquid gastric emptying were measured in 14 patients who had undergone gastric interposition for esophageal and hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Rates of emptying were measured in both the supine and upright position using a dual-isotope radiolabeling technique. In these patients, the rate of gastric emptying of both solids and liquids was significantly slower in the supine position than in the upright position. Emptying in supine patients was also prolonged when compared with supine normal volunteers. Conversely, the upright rate of solid and liquid emptying in the patients was accelerated when compared with published values for upright normal volunteers. We conclude that gastric emptying after gastric interposition is dependent on upright posture after meals. \nPotentially lethal complications of shigellosis. Complications that can lead to death during shigellosis include intestinal as well as systemic manifestations. The former include intestinal perforation, toxic megacolon, and dehydration, and the latter include sepsis, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, seizures and encephalopathy, hemolyticuremic syndrome, pneumonia, and malnutrition. Data on the frequency of these complications come primarily from hospital-based studies, in which sepsis-either with Shigella or with other Enterobacteriaceae-and hypoglycemia are the most common causes of death. Management of these two complications requires broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic treatment of all severely ill, malnourished patients with shigellosis as well as frequent feedings to prevent hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, in developing countries, access to parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents is often limited, and frequent feedings are often precluded by the severe anorexia that is characteristic of shigellosis. Realistic approaches to the reduction of mortality from shigellosis must continue to focus on prevention and early antimicrobial therapy rather than on treatment of established complications. \nThe value of the tumor marker CA 15-3 in diagnosing and monitoring breast cancer. A comparative study with carcinoembryonic antigen. To estimate the utility of the tumor-associated antigen CA 15-3 in the diagnosis of patients with breast cancer, this tumor marker was measured preoperatively in 1342 patients. This group included 509 patients with malignant disease (134 breast cancer patients and 375 patients with other malignancies not involving the breast) and 833 patients with benign surgical diseases (95 patients with fibroadenoma of the breast and 738 patients with other benign diseases). The results were compared with those obtained for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The CA 15-3 level was above normal (25 U/ml) in 31% of the patients with breast cancer, in 22% of patients with other malignancies, and in 9% of patients with benign diseases. The CEA level was elevated in 26% of patients with breast cancer (more than 3 ng/ml). There was a good correlation of CA 15-3 levels with the tumor stage of breast cancer. Both CA 15-3 and CEA also were determined in 671 patients who had received initial curative surgery of breast cancer and who regularly attended our follow-up clinic. The CA 15-3 was found to be more sensitive than CEA in detecting recurrences of breast cancer. In the postcare period, carcinoma recurred in 205 patients. Of these, 73% had CA 15-3 concentrations above 25 U/ml; only 50% had CEA values above 3 ng/ml (P less than 0.0001). Although neither CA 15-3 nor CEA were sensitive enough for the screening and diagnosis of early breast cancer, CA 15-3 was significantly better than CEA in the detection of breast cancer metastases. \nCaesarean section in undiagnosed Eisenmenger's syndrome. Report of a patient with a fatal outcome. An obstetric patient is described in whom the first sign of cardiac disease was unexplained hypoxaemia during emergency anaesthesia for antepartum haemorrhage, with an eventual fatal outcome. The case highlights the importance of patient information at the booking clinic, and the implications of a raised haemaglobin in early pregnancy. \nFetal phenytoin exposure, hypoplastic nails, and jitteriness. In a prospective study infants born to mothers with epilepsy (n = 61) were found to have an unexpectedly high incidence of congenital anomalies (26/61, 43%) and neonatal conditions (26/61, 43%) compared with controls (0/62, and 6/62, 10%, respectively). There were two neonatal deaths in the study group but none among the controls. Hypoplasia of the finger or toenails was a common congenital anomaly in those infants whose mothers had received phenytoin alone or in combination with other anticonvulsant drugs (11 of 40, 28%). The mean serum phenytoin concentration was higher among mothers of infants with hypoplastic nails than among those with normal nails. Jitteriness was a common neonatal condition affecting infants of epileptic mothers (11 of 61, 18%) but not controls The mean cord serum phenytoin concentrations were similar among jittery and non-jittery infants. At follow up (after excluding one infant with Down's syndrome from the study group) the infants seemed to have developed normally, though one had serious learning difficulties at school. We suggest that hypoplasia of the nails is related to high maternal serum concentrations of phenytoin, and though 18% of infants born to epileptic mothers were jittery compared with no control infants this may not be the result of withdrawal of the drug in all cases. \nPrevalence of epilepsy in Rochester, Minnesota: 1940-1980. The prevalence of epilepsy in Rochester, Minnesota has been determined for a specific date in each of 5 decennial census years. Individuals with a diagnosis of epilepsy (recurrent unprovoked seizures) who were known to have experienced a seizure or who had received antiepileptic medication in the preceding 5 years were considered active prevalence cases. By this definition, the age-adjusted prevalence per 1,000 population, increased steadily from 2.7 in 1940 to 6.8 in 1980. At each of five prevalence dates, for all prevalence cases, 60% had epilepsy manifest by partial seizures, and 75% had no known etiology. Prevalence was higher for males than females for all except the last prevalence day. After 1950, prevalence tended to increase with advancing age and was highest in the oldest age groups. On the average, the 1980 prevalence cases had epilepsy less than 10 years and greater than 50% had their first diagnosis in the first 20 years of life. \nUse of a somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate, in the management of acute gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease. PURPOSE: Because the secretory diarrhea of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of the gut induces serious metabolic and nutritional disturbances, this study was initiated to assess the use of a somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate, as adjunctive therapy for severe GvHD of the gut with massive diarrhea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a pilot study, six patients with biopsy-confirmed acute gut GvHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation received octreotide 50 to 250 micrograms three times a day subcutaneously. RESULTS: Three of the six treated patients had a prompt and dramatic reduction in stool volume within 1 to 3 days of initiation of octreotide therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Somatostatin and its analogues have been used successfully in diarrheal states by antagonism of neuropeptide overproduction, although other potential therapeutic mechanisms include inhibition of fluid secretion, enhanced salt absorption, and inhibition of gut motility. Somatostatin and its analogues may be promising adjunctive agents in the treatment of gastrointestinal GvHD, although assessment in a controlled trial will be required to confirm their therapeutic efficacy. \nSteroid receptors in breast cancer. Recent advances in steroid receptor structure and function now indicate that oestrogen binds to the oestrogen receptor (ER) molecule at a specific site, denoted region E. This allows binding of the oestrogen-ER complex to DNA via cysteine residues in region C of the ER molecule, which tetrahedrally co-ordinate zinc. This modulates transcription and stimulates cell growth. A number of newly discovered growth factors are also regulated by ER, as is the progesterone receptor. Steroid receptor concentrations in tissues can now be measured on smaller tissue samples using enzyme immunoassay or on cells obtained by fine needle aspiration using monoclonal antibody technology. The prognostic value of steroid receptor is limited, but still constitutes the best marker for predicting response to endocrine therapy. The role of steroid receptors in selecting patients for adjuvant therapy is discussed. \nNimodipine and bradycardia in acute stroke--drug or disease? A patient who had suffered an acute ischemic stroke experienced bradycardia while being treated with nimodipine 80 mg tid. This became evident after the initiation of nimodipine and progressed, leading to the drug being discontinued after three days of therapy. The bradycardia resolved shortly after the treatment was terminated and normal heart rate was maintained throughout 23 days of hospitalization and in subsequent outpatient follow-up. Although nimodipine-induced bradycardia is possible, hemispheric cerebral infarction may also cause transient bradyarrhythmias in the acute stroke period. There is a need to monitor the heart rate and rhythm of all acute stroke patients, especially those receiving nimodipine. \nGlomerulopathy in patient with Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate renal structure in a child with Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism), who at 10 yr of age was noted to have hypertension, microalbuminuria, and enlarged kidneys, a renal biopsy was performed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The renal biopsy tissue was evaluated by light and electron microscopy with standard stereological techniques to measure glomerular volume, glomerular basement membrane width, fractional mesangial volume, and peripheral capillary filtering surface density. RESULTS: On renal biopsy, there was a marked increase in glomerular volume, glomerular basement width, and mesangial volume, findings similar to those seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: This patient with marked insulin resistance associated with Donohue syndrome demonstrates renal and glomerular enlargement and morphometric glomerular changes similar to those seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. In unusual syndromes with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, renal structural and functional changes typical of traditional diabetes mellitus may be seen. \nPseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery: a forgotten complication of tonsillitis? Pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery is an uncommon but potentially lethal complication of tonsillar or peritonsillar sepsis, which appears to have occurred more frequently prior to the introduction of penicillin. Management of such a case is discussed, and a literature review presented. \nPatient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in head and neck surgery. Patients undergoing head and neck surgery often have significant pain because of the anatomic area involved, the nature of the surgery and trauma associated with the anesthesia and surgery, or the use of packing postoperatively. A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) infuser is available that allows the patient to direct delivery of their own analgesia. The physician orders the narcotic analgesic dose to be given, the interval between doses, and the total amount of analgesic to be delivered over 4 hours. The patient simply presses a button connected to the analgesic infuser, which delivers a predetermined intravenous dose of the particular analgesic. The infuser is then \"locked out\" for an interval of 10 to 15 minutes before the patient can direct another dose of medicine. This system allows the patients to initiate intravenous delivery of their narcotic analgesic, and maintain control of pain, using small incremental doses of the analgesic agent. This PCA pump has been used successfully in a number of patients undergoing various general, head and neck, and facial aesthetic procedures. The general concept of the PCA pump, guidelines for use, and contraindications are presented. \nA nine-year experience with crossover femoro-femoro-popliteal sequential bypass. Multisegmental arterial occlusive disease may require a combined inflow and outflow procedure for optimal treatment of limb ischemia. Twenty-one patients with unilateral iliac artery stenosis or occlusion and ipsilateral superficial femoral artery occlusion underwent crossover femoro-femoro-popliteal sequential bypass during a 9-year period. Seventeen operations were for limb salvage. Patency rates were determined separately for each segment of the bypass. Primary patency rates for the femoro-femoral segment were 89%, 83%, and 57% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Primary patency rates for the femoro-popliteal segments were 68%, 62%, and 40% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Limb salvage rates were 100%, 90%, and 77% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. This experience indicates that femoro-femoro-popliteal bypass is an effective treatment in selected patients with severe ischemia due to combined iliac artery and superficial femoral artery disease. \nInitial clinical study of indium-111-labeled clone 110 anticarcinoembryonic antigen antibody in patients with colorectal cancer. A murine monoclonal antibody directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was labeled with indium-111 (111In) by means of a benzylisothiocyanate derivative of diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) and used for clinical radioimmunodetection studies. Twenty-one patients having a history of surgically resected colorectal cancer and rising serum CEA levels suggestive of tumor recurrence were studied. Patients were infused over 20 minutes with 5, 10, or 20 mg of the monoclonal antibody labeled with 5 mCi of 111In. The mean radiochemical purity was greater than 96%. No toxicity was seen. The stability of the radiolabel on antibody in patient serum was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with autoradiography, and immunoprecipitation for up to 96 hours after infusion. Tumor sites were identified in 20 of 21 patients. Sites of antibody accumulation in 20 patients were confirmed as tumor either by resection at laparotomy (16 patients) or fine-needle biopsy (four patients). Nine patients who had the identified lesion resected or irradiated showed return of the serum CEA antigen level to normal or near normal values. In the absence of high levels of circulating CEA (greater than 500 ng/mL), the disappearance of radioactivity from patient serum demonstrated first order elimination kinetics, with a mean half-life of 38 hours. The serum half-life was not affected by the dose of antibody administered or by serum CEA titers below 500 ng/mL. Despite a mean liver uptake of 18% injected dose (ID) 24 hours after administration, hepatic metastases were easily visualized as areas of increased uptake of radioactivity. Radioimmunodetection of recurrent colorectal cancer, not detected by computed tomographic (CT) scans, appears achievable with this agent. This may allow successful clinical intervention in selected patients. \nDetection of preclinical Parkinson's disease with PET. Putamen 18F-dopa uptake of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms; therefore, positron-emission tomography (PET) can be used to detect preclinical disease in clinically unaffected twins and relatives of patients with PD. Three out of 6 monozygotic and 2 out of 3 dizygotic unaffected PD co-twins have shown reduced putamen 18F-dopa uptake to date. In addition, an intact sibling and a daughter of 1 of 4 siblings with PD both had low putamen 18F-dopa uptake. These preliminary findings suggest there may be a familial component to the etiology of PD. PET can also be used to detect underlying nigral pathology in patients with isolated tremor and patients who become rigid taking dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Patients with familial essential tremor have normal, and those with isolated rest tremor have consistently low, putamen 18F-dopa uptake. Drug-induced parkinsonism is infrequently associated with underlying nigral pathology. \nOptochiasmal arachnoiditis following muslin wrapping of ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Optochiasmal arachnoiditis has been reported following treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms, particularly arising from the anterior communicating artery. It has been suggested that the accompanying loss of vision is due to a muslin-induced optic neuropathy. This paper considers five cases of this condition; the response to steroid therapy was beneficial in three cases. A review of the literature is included. The arachnoiditis is considered to be due to an inflammatory response to muslin gauze placed close to the optic nerves and chiasm. \nUnderdiagnosis and poor documentation of acute confusional states in elderly hip fracture patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of diagnosis and documentation of acute confusional states (ACS) in the medical records of patients with hip fracture. DESIGN: The diagnosis of ACS in two prospective clinical studies was compared to its diagnosis in the medical records of the same patients on the same hospitalization. In order to determine if the simultaneous prospective study influences the diagnostic and documentary practices evidenced in the medical records, a further comparison was done by reviewing medical records of two series of patients seen some years prior to the prospective studies. SETTING: Patients with femoral neck fractures treated at a department of orthopedic surgery in a university hospital and one retrospective control sample from a department of general surgery in a county hospital. SUBJECTS: Two prospective samples of patients 65 years and older treated for femoral neck fractures (n = 111 and n = 57, respectively) and two earlier retrospective samples (n = 66 and n = 68, respectively). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All comparisons showed that both physicians and nurses diagnosed ACS unsatisfactorily and documented the patients' mental status poorly. The analysis of the two retrospective medical record control samples gave the same results. Neither the physicians nor the nurses used any kind of diagnostic instrument to detect cognitive disorders in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: ACS is a common and severe complication in elderly people treated for femoral neck fractures. Acute confusional states have, by definition, one or more causes that can often be identified and treated. Poor assessment and documentation is a threat to the patients as a correct diagnosis of ACS is a prerequisite for further assessment of its underlying causes and the consequent necessary medical and nursing care. \nAssessment of coronary artery patency after thrombolytic therapy: accurate prediction utilizing the combined analysis of three noninvasive markers. The predictability of patency of the infarct-related artery assessed by means of three noninvasive easily obtainable markers was prospectively examined in 82 patients undergoing thrombolysis for their first myocardial infarction. Positive noninvasive markers were defined as follows: 1) early peak creatine kinase (CK) activity less than or equal to 12 h after the start of thrombolysis; 2) greater than or equal to 50% reduction in ST segment elevation; and 3) occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias within the 1st 90 min of thrombolytic therapy. In 63 (77%) of the 82 patients, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade II/III reperfusion was achieved within the 1st 90 min as assessed by coronary angiography. Separate analysis of each marker revealed the following respective values for sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value regarding prediction of coronary artery patency: CK peak less than or equal to 12 h: 84%, 95%, 98% and 64%; reduction of the ST segment elevation greater than or equal to 50%: 60%, 95%, 97% and 42%; and reperfusion arrhythmias: 63%, 89%, 95% and 43%. The combined analysis of all three markers utilizing a logistic regression procedure showed that CK peak (p = 0.0001) and resolution of the ST segment elevation (p = 0.005), but not the occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias (p = 0.26), were independent predictors of vessel patency. From this logistic regression procedure, a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 100% for prediction of coronary artery patency were obtained. \nBiology of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from malignant disease in Western society. Apart from the fortunate few patients who present with a resectable small pancreatic adenocarcinoma, conventional treatment offers no hope of cure and has little palliative value. Over the past two decades major steps have been made in our understanding of the biology of pancreatic growth and neoplasia. This review sets out to explore these advances, firstly in the regulation of normal pancreatic growth, and secondly the mechanism which may be involved in malignant change of the exocrine pancreas. From an understanding of this new biology, new treatment strategies may be possible for patients with pancreatic cancer. \nDelayed plasma clearance of phenylalanine and tyrosine in elderly men. The plasma levels of 17 amino acids were measured in three groups of men: healthy young men, healthy elderly men, and demented tube-fed elderly men living in a nursing home, prior to, and again 2, 4, and 6 hours after the consumption of a standard protein-containing meal. The standard meal provided per kilogram of body weight 8.3 calories, 0.33 grams of protein, 0.90 grams of carbohydrate, and 0.37 grams of fat. The concentrations of all amino acids, except tryptophan, rose significantly at 2 hours and returned to baseline by 6 hours. Plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher at 2 hours in the two groups of elderly men than in the young healthy men. In other respects the pre- and post-prandial amino acid profiles were not influenced by age. The ratio, tyrosine/other large neutral amino acids (tyr/LNAA), was significantly higher in both elderly groups than in the young men at nearly all time points before and after the test meal. It was generally higher in the demented older men than in the healthy older men. The data demonstrated a delayed plasma clearance of phenylalanine and tyrosine in old age. The elevated plasma tyr/LNAA ratio in the elderly men may have tended to augment an entry of tyrosine, the precursor of norepinephrine and dopamine, into their brains. \nHospital characteristics associated with adverse events and substandard care. To explore the epidemiology of adverse events (AEs), which were defined as injuries due to medical treatment, and that subset of AEs caused by negligence, we studied interhospital variation in these outcomes in a sample of 31,000 medical records drawn from a random selection of 51 hospitals in New York in 1984. We found a substantial variation in both AE rates (0.2% to 7.9%; mean, 3.2%) and the percentage of AEs due to negligence (1% to 60%; mean, 24.9%) among hospitals. Univariate analyses of AEs revealed that primary teaching institutions had significantly higher rates (4.1%) and rural hospitals had significantly lower ones (1.0%). The percentage of AEs due to negligence was lower in primary teaching (10.7%) and for-profit (9.5%) hospitals and was significantly higher in hospitals with predominantly (greater than 80%) minority patients who had been discharged (37%). These findings were corroborated by multivariate analysis. Our results suggest that AEs and negligence are not randomly distributed and that certain types of hospitals have significantly higher rates of injuries due to substandard care. These observations may represent an important improvement on existing measures of quality because they take into account the fact that some hospitals' populations may be at risk of suffering a poor outcome. \nDobutamine digital echocardiography for detecting coronary artery disease. To assess the value of dobutamine echocardiography for detecting coronary artery disease (CAD), 70 men (mean age 62 +/- 8 years) presenting for coronary angiography were prospectively studied. Dobutamine (2.5 to 40 micrograms/kg/min) was infused in 3-minute stages. Digital echocardiograms were recorded on-line at baseline, during low- and high-dose dobutamine infusion, and at recovery. An echocardiogram positive for CAD was defined as one showing a new wall motion abnormality induced by dobutamine. Compared with coronary angiography, the overall sensitivity of dobutamine echocardiography for detecting CAD was 86%, specificity 95% and accuracy 89%. The sensitivity for detecting 3-vessel CAD was 100%, 89% for 2-vessel and 69% for 1-vessel CAD. The accuracy of predicting multivessel disease by 2 methods was 71% and 84%, respectively. Heart rate at the echocardiographic ischemic threshold was lower in patients with 3- and 2-vessel CAD versus 1-vessel CAD (89 +/- 17, 95 +/- 18 and 118 +/- 18 beats/min, respectively, p less than 0.01); rate-pressure product was also lower in patients with 3- and 2-vessel CAD versus 1-vessel CAD (12.7 +/- 3.6, 13.7 +/- 2.8 and 18.9 +/- 44 x 10(3) beats/min x mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.01). Heart rate was the most important physiologic determinant of ischemia induced by dobutamine. There were no major complications during the study. Thus, dobutamine digital echocardiography is an excellent test for identifying CAD and should be beneficial in patients unable to exercise. \nIfosfamide extrapyramidal neurotoxicity. Ifosfamide-associated central nervous system toxicity has been reported in 5% to 30% of patients treated with ifosfamide. Its pattern is characterized by metabolic encephalopathy with confusion, blurred vision, mutism, auditory or visual paranoid hallucinations, seizures, and rarely coma. The biochemical cause of the neurotoxicity is not understood completely, but it is thought to result from an accumulation of drug metabolites with direct central nervous system effects. A case of ifosfamide neurotoxicity is reported that had unusual extrapyramidal features in a patient treated with a 5-day course of infused ifosfamide. Although usually spontaneously reversible with cessation of drug administration, ifosfamide neurotoxicity occasionally has been associated with prolonged psychopathologic sequelae. Death from irreversible encephalopathy has also been reported rarely. The authors believe that classic extrapyramidal symptoms should be considered to be a part of the neurotoxic profile of ifosfamide. \nActivity of doxorubicin and cisplatin combination chemotherapy in patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma. An Italian Lung Cancer Task Force (FONICAP) Phase II study. Twenty-six symptomatic patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma (DMPM) were enrolled in a Phase II Italian Lung Cancer Task Force (FONICAP) study to assess the activity and toxicity of doxorubicin and cisplatin combination chemotherapy. The drug schedule was as follows; 60 mg/m2 of doxorubicin and 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin both given intravenously (IV) on day 1 every 3 to 4 weeks. Of the 24 evaluable patients, 6 objective partial responses (25%; 95% confidence limits, 9.77% to 46.71%) were observed. Twelve of 24 patients (50%), including 6 with no radiologic evidence of response, had a clinical improvement as demonstrated by an objective reduction of symptom or performance status scores along treatment. The overall median survival time was 10 months. Toxicity was mild and dose reductions or suspensions were not required. The combination of doxorubicin and cisplatin is effective and well tolerated. It might be considered for palliation of symptomatic patients with DMPM. \nEffect of potassium intake on blood pressure. Epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical studies suggest that potassium is an important regulator of blood pressure. Surveys conducted in widely divergent geographic locations indicate higher prevalence of hypertension in populations ingesting diets low in potassium. Amelioration of hypokalemia lowers blood pressure in mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension in rats and in essential hypertensive patients receiving thiazide diuretics. We observed that in normotensive subjects ingesting normal amounts of sodium, short-term potassium depletion increases the mean arterial pressure from 90.9 +/- 2.2 mm Hg to 95.0 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, acute sodium loading increases blood pressure in potassium-depleted subjects but it had no effect in subjects ingesting normal amounts of potassium. Preliminary studies indicate that short-term potassium depletion also elevates blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Potassium supplementation lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients ingesting normal amounts of sodium. Blacks appear to be more sensitive to the hypotensive effects of potassium. The mechanism of potassium-induced changes in blood pressure is not well understood. Potassium depletion consistently induces sodium retention. The hypertensive effects of potassium depletion and hypotensive effects of potassium supplementation are not observed when sodium intake is kept low. Direct vasoconstrictive effects of hypokalemia may contribute to the pressor effect of potassium depletion. The role of altered vascular sensitivity to vasoactive hormones and alterations in divalent cation metabolism in mediating the potassium-induced changes in blood pressure require further study. \nA phase I trial of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta alone and in combination with myelosuppressive doses of 5-fluorouracil in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. We studied escalating doses of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) alone and after a myelosuppressive dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Transient neutropenia, monocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia were observed followed by a 1.3- to 6.0-fold (mean, 3.46-fold) dose-dependent neutrophil leukocytosis (P less than .00001) on the days of IL-1 beta administration. Increases in platelet counts were observed at a median of 14 days (range, 6 to 23) after IL-1 beta administration. Transient hypoglycemia, rebound hyperglycemia, elevations in serum cortisol, and C-reactive protein were observed. Side effects included fever, rigors, and headache in the majority of patients. Hypotension was observed in three of five patients at the highest dose level (0.1 micrograms/kg) and was dose-limiting. Fewer days of neutropenia were noted after 5-FU plus IL-1 beta than after 5-FU alone; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. These data show that IL-1 beta has stimulatory effects in human hematopoiesis. \nCT of acute pancreatitis: correlation between lack of contrast enhancement and pancreatic necrosis. This study was performed to determine if a correlation exists between pancreatic parenchymal enhancement or lack thereof on contrast-enhanced CT and surgical evidence of pancreatic necrosis. Accurate CT assessment of pancreatic vascular perfusion would be helpful in preoperative planning before pancreatic debridement and necrosectomy. The CT scans and medical records were blindly and retrospectively reviewed in 13 patients with the operative diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. In all cases, CT examinations preceded surgery within 72 hr. Surgical and pathologic findings served as the gold standards for the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. Seven (54%) of 13 patients had a region or regions of parenchymal necrosis within the head, body, and/or tail of the pancreas seen during surgery. All seven of these patients had no pancreatic enhancement on CT in at least one region of the pancreas (CT sensitivity = 100%). In four of the seven, two regions were found to be necrotic at surgery, but only one of the two segments did not enhance on CT scans. In three of the seven patients, lack of contrast enhancement on CT (no enhancement of the pancreatic head and body in two patients and throughout the gland in another) correlated with necrosis in the same regions at surgery. The remaining six (46%) patients, who had peripancreatic or small, focal, and/or superficial areas of pancreatic necrosis at surgery, had normal pancreatic enhancement on CT. Our results show that regions of pancreatic necrosis found surgically correlate with lack of enhancement of pancreatic parenchyma on CT. Peripancreatic necrosis and minor areas of focal or superficial parenchymal necrosis were not detected on CT. \nPsammomatous melanotic schwannoma: an additional component of Carney's complex. Report of a case. The authors report a case of Carney's complex (the complex of myxomas, spotty pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity) in a 32-year-old white man. Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma has recently been included as a component of this disorder. The complex was recognized after a psammomatous melanotic schwannoma was resected from the sacral canal. Subsequent echocardiography revealed ventricular cardiac myxomata. Resection of these lesions was successfully performed. Review of previous history and pathologic material further supported the diagnosis. The authors conclude that recognition of each component as part of the syndrome is of crucial importance, because it may prevent a fatal outcome. A family screening program should be performed in each case. \nNeurogenic sarcoma of the sinonasal tract. Five cases of a rare malignant sinonasal tumour of neurofibromatous nature are described. The term neurogenic sarcoma (or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour) is advocated instead of malignant schwannoma. The clinicopathological features of this tumour are described, and the different diagnosis are discussed. The necessity of using immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of sinonasal tumours of fibromatous nature is emphasized. The clinical management consists of radical surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Clinically there seems to be a high-grade and a low-grade type of sinonasal neurogenic sarcoma, however, this could not be distinguished histologically in the present series. \nRelative efficacy of antithrombin compared with antiplatelet agents in accelerating coronary thrombolysis and preventing early reocclusion. BACKGROUND. Optimal coronary thrombolysis should be prompt and persistent. Although activation of platelets and increased thrombin activity have been associated with clinical thrombolysis, the role of each in delaying thrombolysis or inducing early coronary reocclusion has been difficult to define. METHODS AND RESULTS. In conscious dogs with coronary thrombosis induced by electrical current, we assessed the impact on the rapidity of thrombolysis and the incidence of reocclusion of two types of adjunctive treatment given concomitantly with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): 1) inhibition of platelet function with a peptide mimetic antagonist of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors or with lysine acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 2) inhibition of thrombin activity with recombinant hirudin or with heparin. ASA but not the receptor antagonist shortened the time to thrombolysis with t-PA (20 +/- 13 [mean +/- SD] minutes with ASA, 36 +/- 15 minutes with receptor antagonist, and 43 +/- 16 minutes with the saline control). Reocclusion occurred promptly after completion of the infusion of t-PA in all seven dogs given saline. Reocclusion was delayed and prevented in some dogs within 90 minutes after the end of the infusion of t-PA by both antiplatelet agents but still occurred in 42% despite continued inhibition of platelet function (i.e., three of six dogs given ASA and two of six given receptor antagonist). In contrast, inhibition of thrombin activity with recombinant hirudin in a dose that prolonged the partial thromboplastin time modestly (1.5-2-fold) resulted in accelerated lysis (19 +/- 10 minutes) and prevention of reocclusion in each of six dogs. Heparin given in doses that elicited similar prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time did not accelerate lysis nor prevent reocclusion, which occurred in five of six dogs. CONCLUSIONS. Inhibition of thrombin by recombinant hirudin facilitates thrombolysis and maintains patency of coronary arteries recanalized with t-PA particularly effectively. The benefit conferred may reflect direct anticoagulant effects plus diminished activation of platelets secondary to decreased thrombin activity. \nCharacterization of the structure of the erythropoietin receptor by ligand blotting. Erythropoietin (Epo) regulates the growth and differentiation of erythroid cells by binding to a specific receptor. We characterized the native Epo receptor on erythroleukemia cell lines by ligand blotting. Solubilized cell membrane proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with 125I-Epo. Specificity was demonstrated by inhibition of 125I-Epo binding by unlabeled excess Epo but not other peptide growth factors and by the cellular distribution of the Epo binding protein. A single membrane protein of 61 Kd +/- 4 Kd was sufficient to bind 125I Epo in both human (OCIM2, K562) and murine (GM979, Rauscher, DA-1) cell lines. This finding is consistent with the predicted size of the Epo receptor from the murine cDNA clone. However, chemical crosslinking of 125I-Epo to its receptor has identified two Epo binding proteins of 105 Kd and 85 Kd. This difference may occur because the receptor is size fractionated before Epo binding in the ligand blot, but after Epo binding in crosslinking studies. Ligand blotting demonstrates that the native Epo receptor is composed of a single 61-Kd Epo binding protein, and suggests the presence of additional proteins of 20 to 25 Kd that associate with the receptor after Epo binding. \nActivation signals leading to proliferation of normal and leukemic CD3+ large granular lymphocytes. The activation signals leading to proliferation of normal and leukemic CD3+ large granular lymphocytes (LGL) were studied in vitro. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) alone (P less than .01) and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) alone (P less than .01) caused significant stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from four CD3+ LGL leukemia patients, as measured in a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. Recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4) alone had no effect (P = .11). The combination signals of anti-CD3 MoAb and either IL-2 or IL-4 produced a proliferative response greater than anti-CD3 MoAb alone (P less than .01) or lymphokine alone (P less than .01). Leukemic LGL, purified by two-color sorting, were subsequently activated by anti-CD3 MoAb and IL-2 and assessed for DNA content by viable Hoechst No. 33342 (HO) staining. Results of these studies demonstrated that leukemic LGL were stimulated directly by anti-CD3 MoAb and IL-2, with the percentage of cells in cell cycle (S + G2/M) ranging from 16% to 72%. Normal CD3+ LGL were also stimulated to enter the cell cycle by anti-CD3 and IL-2. These results show that leukemic LGL proliferate in vitro after activation through the T-cell receptor and/or lymphokine. \nCirculatory adaptation to orthostatic stress in healthy 10-14-year-old children investigated in a general practice. 1. The magnitude and time course of circulatory adaptation to active standing were investigated in healthy premenarchic girls and boys (n = 24; 10-14 years old) by non-invasive measurement of heart rate and continuous finger blood pressure (Finapres). 2. Four subjects (two girls, two boys) showed presyncopal symptoms after 4-9 min of free standing. 3. In the 20 non-fainting subjects, changes in blood pressure and heart rate upon standing did not differ between girls (n = 10) and boys (n = 10). In the initial phase of standing (first 30 s) systolic and diastolic blood pressures dropped by 22 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD) and 16 +/- 7 mmHg, respectively, at 8 +/- 2 s. Blood pressure subsequently recovered and showed an overshoot in all subjects. The transient drop in blood pressure was accompanied by an increase in heart rate of 40 +/- 7 beats/min. These characteristic transient changes were not observed with passive head-up tilt. During the early steady-state phase (2 min), systolic blood pressure was similar to the supine value and diastolic blood pressure rose by 11 +/- 5 mmHg. Heart rate increased by 25 +/- 11 beats/min. In six of the subjects (three girls, three boys) the increase in heart rate exceeded 30 beats/min (postural tachycardia). Little further changes were observed during prolonged (10 min) standing. \nFetal cephaloceles: diagnosis with US. The prenatal sonograms of 15 fetuses with cephaloceles (13 occipital, one ethmoidal, and one frontoparietal) were retrospectively reviewed. The prognosis for fetuses with cephaloceles was poor: Only three of 14 with follow-up were born alive (21%), and all are likely to be handicapped. Karyotypes were abnormal in four of nine fetuses tested (44%). Associated cranial abnormalities observed in various numbers of fetuses included ventriculomegaly, the \"lemon\" sign, a flat basioccipital, \"beaked\" tectum, and bone defect. A wide variety of neural and nonneural anomalies were associated with cephaloceles. At least one sonographically observed concomitant neural or nonneural axis abnormality or an abnormal karyotype was present in nine of 15 fetuses (60%). Some associated neural malformations noted pathologically were not observed prenatally. Cranial meningoceles were not accurately distinguished from encephaloceles sonographically, and they also were associated with a poor prognosis. Comparison of findings in fetuses with cephaloceles with those of 15 fetuses with cystic hygromas revealed that the two abnormalities can usually be distinguished by the relationship of the mass with the neck and by other cranial findings present in fetuses with cephaloceles but absent in association with cystic hygromas. \nClassification and natural history of clinically identifiable subtypes of cerebral infarction. We describe the incidence and natural history of four clinically identifiable subgroups of cerebral infarction in a community-based study of 675 patients with first-ever stroke. Of 543 patients with a cerebral infarct, 92 (17%) had large anterior circulation infarcts with both cortical and subcortical involvement (total anterior circulation infarcts, TACI); 185 (34%) had more restricted and predominantly cortical infarcts (partial anterior circulation infarcts, PACI); 129 (24%) had infarcts clearly associated with the vertebrobasilar arterial territory (posterior circulation infarcts, POCI); and 137 (25%) had infarcts confined to the territory of the deep perforating arteries (lacunar infarcts, LACI). There were striking differences in natural history between the groups. The TACI group had a negligible chance of good functional outcome and mortality was high. More than twice as many deaths were due to the complications of immobility than to direct neurological sequelae of the infarct. Patients in the PACI group were much more likely to have an early recurrent stroke than were patients in other groups. Those in the POCI group were at greater risk of a recurrent stroke later in the first year after the index event but had the best chance of a good functional outcome. Despite the small anatomical size of the infarcts in the LACI group, many patients remained substantially handicapped. The findings have important implications for the planning of stroke treatment trials and suggest that various therapies could be directed specifically at the subgroups. \nHepatocellular expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 in chronic hepatitis. T lymphocyte-mediated cytolytic immune reactions are considered a major cause of hepatocyte injury in chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis. To further investigate local immune responses, we studied the expression of lymphocyte antigens and cell-cell interaction molecules known to be involved in effector-target cell interactions by light and electron microscopy in liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis. CD8+ lymphocytes were found to be the predominant population of cells in the inflammatory infiltrate in chronic hepatitis B and non-A, non-B hepatitis. In contrast, CD4+ cells constituted a comparably higher proportion of cells and were more numerous than CD8+ cells in chronic autoimmune hepatitis. In both viral and autoimmune hepatitis, a substantial portion of lymphocytes expressed activation antigens such as T11/3 (CD2R) and IL-2-R (CD25). Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (CD58), which mediates lymphocyte adhesion and activation and is the natural ligand of the CD2/T11 lymphocyte surface receptor, could be demonstrated on endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Hepatocellular lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 expression in chronic hepatitis showed membranous and cytoplasmic staining of hepatocytes and had a positive correlation with the degree of inflammatory activity. These results suggest that effector-target interactions between hepatocytes and lymphocytes mediated by the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3/CD2 pathway play a role in chronic inflammatory liver disease. Possible functional consequences of this interaction include enhancement of antigen-specific immune reactions and antigen-independent mechanisms of T cell activation, which may contribute considerably to the degree of inflammatory activity and tissue damage in chronic hepatitis. \nIgG reactivity in the spinal cord and motor cortex in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The spinal cord and motor cortex of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were examined with immunohistochemical methods for the presence of IgG. In 13 of 15 spinal cords, a population of motoneurons stained positively for IgG in a granular pattern, characteristic of binding to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In 6 of 11 motor cortices, a proportion of pyramidal cells also stained positively for IgG. No such reactivity was noted in motoneurons of control human tissues, although positive IgG staining was present in astrocytes of ALS and control specimens. Reactive microglia and/or macrophages were detected in the territory of degenerating pyramidal tracts and ventral horns. The surface of most of these cells stained positively for IgG, and 50% stained positively for HLA-DR. The accumulation of IgG in motoneurons and the presence of immunologically active macrophages provide additional evidence for the participation of immunologic factors in the pathogenesis of ALS. \nSurvival of patients with well-differentiated astrocytomas diagnosed in the era of computed tomography. We report 25 verified cases of well-differentiated cerebral astrocytomas in adults treated between 1978 and 1988. All patients were diagnosed by computed tomographic (CT) scans, with 5 undergoing a craniotomy for debulking and 20 undergoing a biopsy alone. The median survival for the entire group was 8.2 years, the longest survival yet reported for a series of patients with these tumors. A review of the literature suggests that the longer survival observed in more recent series is the result of the earlier diagnosis of tumors afforded by modern brain imaging. Twenty of our patients presented with seizures in the absence of any other focal findings and would probably not have had a biopsy in the era before CT scans until their tumors had progressed. Only 8% of our patients had papilledema at the time of presentation, in contrast to almost half of the patients with low-grade astrocytomas reported before 1975, supporting the hypothesis that patients in the CT era are diagnosed earlier. None of our patients died from progressive low-grade disease. One patient died from a squamous cell cancer, and 7 died as a consequence of their tumors dedifferentiating into a more malignant astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme, with a median time of approximately 5 years after the diagnosis. Our findings, together with the available data in the literature, suggest that death from a focal low-grade astrocytoma, in the absence of malignant degeneration, may be a rare event. Consequently, future therapeutic efforts should be targeted at preventing dedifferentiation. \nA comparison of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. A comparison and survival analysis of 203 patients (21%) with adenocarcinoma and 756 (79%) with squamous cell cancer of the cervix for the time period 1970-1985 is reported. The mean number of new cases of adenocarcinoma (N = 12) remained the same, while squamous cell cases decreased from 57 to 32. The clinical features were compared; oral contraceptive usage, node status, diabetes, and symptoms of bleeding were not related to cell type. Nulliparity was more frequent in patients with adenocarcinoma, whereas obesity and smoking were more frequent in patients with squamous cell cancer. Survival in stage I was significantly influenced by the cell type. Patients with stage I squamous cell disease had a 90% 5-year survival, compared with 60% for adenocarcinoma (P less than .0001). Other features that influenced survival included node status (P = .001), poor differentiation of tumor histology (P = .001), diabetes (P = .001), and Papanicolaou smear interval (P = .001). Patients undergoing radical hysterectomy were analyzed separately, and adenocarcinoma cell type significantly influenced survival (P = .0008). Patients with stage II squamous cell disease had a 62% survival, compared with 47% for adenocarcinoma (P = .01); patients with stage III squamous cell disease had a 36% survival, compared with 8% for adenocarcinoma (P = .002). The percentage of adenocarcinoma has increased because of the decreased number of patients with squamous cell disease. Stage-for-stage survival is significantly decreased for patients with adenocarcinoma as opposed to squamous cell disease. \nRenoduodenal fistula in a patient with chronic nephrostomy drainage: a case report. We describe the occurrence of a renoduodenal fistula related to a nephrostomy tube in a patient with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis and renal calculi. The patient was successfully treated by nephrectomy. Etiological, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects are discussed. \nPiezogenic wrist papules: a common and asymptomatic finding. The first description of piezogenic wrist papules is presented. Twenty-nine persons were examined; 76% had pedal papules and 86% had wrist papules. Piezogenic papules are a common, nonhereditary finding and are not secondary to an inherent connective tissue defect. \nEffects of radiation on fixation of non-cemented porous-coated implants in a canine model. A non-weight-bearing porous-coated rod was implanted bilaterally in the proximal part of the humerus in thirty-five adult male mongrel dogs. In all of the animals, one limb was treated with radiation and the opposite limb served as the control. In twenty-one animals, the dose was 1000 centigrays (rads) and in fourteen, it was 500 centigrays. The strength of fixation and the volume fraction of ingrowth of bone were determined two, four, and eight weeks after the operation in the group that received 1000 centigrays and two and four weeks after the operation in the group that received 500 centigrays. Treatment with 500 centigrays had no significant effect on the strength of fixation or the amount of ingrowth of bone. In contrast, at two weeks, treatment with 1000 centigrays had reduced the strength of fixation to 50 per cent of the control value (p less than 0.01), although, at four and eight weeks, the strength of fixation was not significantly different than that in the control limb. The amount of ingrowth of bone in the irradiated limb was significantly reduced at two weeks (30 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.01), four weeks (70 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.05), and eight weeks (56 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.05). \nEsophagogastric neoplasms: palliation with a modified gianturco stent. Self-expanding metallic stents of a modified Gianturco design were used for palliative treatment of malignant esophagogastric strictures. Over a 10-month period, 10 stents were placed in nine patients. All patients with severe dysphagia due to malignant strictures in whom all other treatment options had failed were candidates for these stents. Neither extensive length of esophageal involvement nor complete esophageal obstruction was a contraindication. All stents were placed with fluoroscopic guidance without any technical failures or procedural morbidity or mortality. Mild reflux occurred in three patients in whom the stent tubes straddled the distal esophageal sphincter. Five patients were still alive after 1-8 months. The remaining four patients died 6-28 weeks after stent placement; all stents were patent at the time of death. These stents are easy to insert, safe, and reasonably effective for short-term palliative treatment of esophagogastric neoplasms. \nTransduodenal exploration of the common bile duct in patients with nondilated ducts. Exploration of the small common bile duct can be technically difficult and is associated with a significant risk of ductal injury or late stricture, or both. Transduodenal common duct exploration after sphincteroplasty (TCDE/S) is an alternative method of duct exploration that avoids choledochotomy. Cholecystectomy followed by TCDE/S was performed upon 28 patients with nondilated ducts and suspected choledocholithiasis. Common duct stones were retrieved in 17 patients. Failure to retrieve stones in the remaining 11 patients was attributed to either false-positive results of cholangiography, forceful passage of stones into the duodenum during the initial insertion of a Fogarty catheter through the cystic duct or a false-negative finding at duct exploration. There was no perioperative mortality. Two patients had asymptomatic postoperative hyperamylasemia. One patient had postoperative pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinemia and cholangitis that resolved with antibiotic therapy by the eighth postoperative day. Other complications included wound infection, delayed gastric emptying, pneumonia and otitis media. The over-all morbidity rate was 28.6 per cent. Long term follow-up was obtained in all 28 patients. All patients in the follow-up group are free of recurrent biliary tract disease. TCDE/S appears to be a safe and effective method of exploring the nondilated common bile duct. \nAcute catastrophic complications of balloon aortic valvuloplasty. The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators. Among the initial 492 patients who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty as part of the Mansfield Investigational Device Exemption Protocol, 31 (6.3%) had acute catastrophic complications. These included ventricular perforation in nine (1.8%), seven women and two men; six cases (67%) involved serial balloon inflations and seven (78%) also involved dual balloon inflations. In six (67%) of the nine patients perforation was fatal. In four patients studied at necropsy, the perforation involved the base of the lateral left ventricular free wall. Pericardiocentesis was performed in five patients, three of whom survived with (one patient) or without (two patients) operative repair. Acute, severe aortic regurgitation developed in four patients (0.8%), all women. None had significant regurgitation before valvuloplasty; dual balloons were used in two of the four. All three patients who underwent emergency valve replacement survived. A fourth patient died 2 days after valvuloplasty without operative intervention. Fatal cardiac arrest complicated balloon aortic valvuloplasty in 13 patients (2.6%), including 7 with cardiogenic shock and 4 with refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Of the seven with shock, four had been treated with serial balloon inflations; dual balloons were used in three. In two of three patients studied at necropsy, the aortic valve was observed to be congenitally bicuspid. A fatal cerebrovascular accident occurred in two patients (0.4%); it was hemorrhagic in one, embolic in another. Both patients were treated with serial (including one dual) balloon inflations. Limb amputation was required in three patients (0.6%), two women and one man; in two patients amputation was above the knee, in the third patient it was limited to two toes. \nExtraspinal causes of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Twelve of 12,125 patients who had been referred during a seven-year period to a specialist in spinal disorders were found to have an extraspinal cause of radiculopathy or neuropathy of the lower extremity. The records of these twelve patients were reviewed retrospectively. The average age of the twelve patients was sixty-five years (range, forty-two to seventy-seven years). The cause of the symptoms was an occult malignant tumor in nine patients and a hematoma, an aneurysm of the obturator artery, or a neurilemoma of the sciatic nerve in the others. The average time from the onset of symptoms to the final diagnosis was eight months (range, one month to two years). The most useful test for determination of the correct diagnosis was computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and bone-scanning of the whole body were of little help in localizing the disease. In four of the twelve patients, an operation was performed on the basis of an incorrect diagnosis. In dealing with elderly patients who have radiculopathy, one should be suspicious that the cause is outside the spine. \nThe clinical diagnosis of migraine: the beginning of therapy. Clear symptoms and signs are found in patients during severe migraine attacks. Diagnostic difficulties are encountered in eliciting this episodic clinical picture. A label of migraine, however, is only the beginning: factors that precipitate attacks, fears aroused in the migraineur and the failure, or partial efficacy, of acute and prophylactic therapy need also to be determined. If migraine is complicated by an additional headache, the analysis becomes more difficult, but the diagnosis still has to be accurate. This, however, is not always possible at the initial interview. A successful consultation should be more than just diagnostic; it is the beginning of treatment. \nPostirradiation angiosarcoma of the vaginal vault. We describe a unique case of an angiosarcoma arising in the vaginal vault 21 years after hysterectomy and radiotherapy for stage I carcinoma of the cervix. We also review the literature regarding angiosarcomas arising after previous radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies. \nRuptured aneurysm of the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta. Analysis according to size and treatment. Acute rupture was confirmed at operation in 117 patients treated for descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Descending thoracic (n = 80) aortic rupture occurred into lung or esophagus in 8, the pleural cavity in 49, and the mediastinum in 23. Upper abdominal aortic (n = 37) rupture occurred into peritoneal cavity in 3 and into retroperitoneal tissues in 34. Aneurysmal size (range, 5 to 17 cm; median, 8 cm) could be determined retrospectively in 86 patients; 59 (74%) descending thoracic and 27 (73%) abdominal aorta. Size (external diameter) in the former was 8 (14%), 5 to 6 cm; 21 (36%), 6 to 8 cm; 23 (39%), 8 to 10 cm; and 7 (12%) greater than 10 cm. Size at the abdominal site was similar. Thus size was not greater than 10 cm in 52 (88%) (range, 5 to 10 cm), which contradicts opinions that thoracic aneurysms rupture only when size exceeds 10 cm. Twenty-nine patients (25%) were hypotensive (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg), of whom 16 (55%) had cardiac arrest before operation. Associated conditions included advanced age (greater than or equal to 75 years) in 26 (22%), coronary artery disease in 41 (35%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 46 (39%), renal insufficiency in 25 (21%), and cardiovascular disease in 22 (18%). The overall early survival rate (30-day) was 89 of 117 patients (76%); 69% in patients with hypotension, 56% of patients with cardiac arrest, 88% in good-risk patients. Five-year (Kaplan-Meier) survival was 28%. Because elective operation is associated with 92% survival, this should be considered before rupture when aneurysm is 5 cm or larger in good-risk patients, in patients with symptomatic aneurysms, and in most patients with larger aneurysms. \nBasal ganglia mass lesions in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. A 2-year-old boy suffered aphasia, hypotonia, dystonia, and loss of activity and spontaneous speech during an active stage of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with pericarditis, fever, anemia, and a high antinuclear antibody titer. These neurologic signs slowly improved with corticosteroid treatment but fluctuated over 1 year. The neuroimaging studies revealed irregular mass lesions in the basal ganglia bilaterally mainly involving the globus pallidus. They gradually decreased in size and almost disappeared after 1 year. A stereotactic brain biopsy revealed a slight proliferation of astrocytes. Chorioretinitis was also observed during the clinical course. A chronic inflammatory process involving cerebral vessels was suspected, although angiography did not demonstrate cerebral vasculitis. The possibility of central nervous system lymphoma could not be eliminated. The type of aphasia and the relation to the lesion sites are discussed. \nSubependymoma with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation: report of a case and literature review. A unique gliomesenchymal neoplasm, consisting of a subependymoma, a form of low-grade glioma, and a rhabdomyosarcoma, is described. It arose and recurred in the brain stem of a 52-year-old man. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the presence of a neuroectodermal marker S-100 protein within some sarcoma cells. The occurrence of this rare tumor supports the concept that striated muscle may derive from a neuroectodermal precursor lesion. \nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy for nonmetastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities. Between September 1986 and December 1988, 125 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremities entered the second neoadjuvant study at the authors' institution. Patients received preoperatively two cycles of methotrexate (MTX) intravenously, followed by cisplatinum (CDP) intraarterially, plus adriamycin (ADM) intravenously. After surgery, the patients classified as \"good responders\" (more than 90% tumor necrosis) received ADM, MTX, and CDP, while the \"poor responders\" (less than 90% tumor necrosis) had a longer chemotherapy that included ifosfamide and etoposide (VP-16) in addition to MTX, ADM, and CDP. Limb salvage was possible in 85% of patients, 8% had an amputation, and 7% had a rotationplasty. The surgical margins were adequate (radical or wide) in 88% of cases and inadequate (marginal or intralesional) in 12%. At an average follow-up period of 28 months (range, 13 to 41), 109 patients (87%) remained continuously disease free, 15 (12%) relapsed with pulmonary metastases, and one patient (0.8%) had a local recurrence. Compared with the first neoadjuvant study at the authors' institution that used only MTX and CDP preoperatively, the percentage of limb salvages, \"good responders,\" and continuously disease-free survival at two years was significantly higher in the second Rizzoli neoadjuvant study (85%, 74%, and 87% versus 77%, 52%, and 59%). Systemic toxicity because of chemotherapy was superimposable. A retrospective analysis of the real dose intensity for each patient demonstrated a correlation between the intensity of chemotherapy and prognosis. \nNeuroleptic use, parkinsonian symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and associated factors in child and adolescent psychiatric patients. OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for neuroleptic-induced movement disorders in a group of psychiatrically hospitalized children and adolescents. METHOD: They evaluated the presence or absence of parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, and akathisia in 104 children and adolescents who were in residence in or admitted over a 6-month period to a state-operated child psychiatric center. They applied a standardized, structured assessment procedure used in research on adult and geriatric psychiatric patients and the mentally retarded. RESULTS: The prevalence of parkinsonism among the 61 subjects at risk was 34% and was significantly associated with longer neuroleptic treatment periods immediately before evaluation. The prevalence of treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia among the 41 subjects at risk was 12% and showed no association with quantitative neuroleptic treatment variables. However, patients with tardive dyskinesia were significantly more likely to have a family history of mental illness and significantly less likely to have a history of assaultive behavior. A pattern of complex pharmacological responses for parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia, some of which are not typical of those most commonly reported in adults, was seen in this group of young patients. CONCLUSIONS: The study data highlight the acute sensitivity of the neuroleptic-treated child and adolescent to the development of parkinsonism, the possible role of certain patient characteristics in the vulnerability to develop tardive dyskinesia, and the possibility that neuroleptic-induced side effects experienced by children and adolescents differ in some ways from those experienced by adults. The data further strongly support the need for systematic monitoring of neuroleptic-treated child and adolescent patients for a full range of side effects. \nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for unstable angina. Coronary angioplasty is an effective treatment for patients with angina at rest, either refractory or initially stabilized but returning despite pharmacologic treatment, and with early postinfarction angina. The procedure has a high initial success rate, but there is an increased risk of major complications resulting from a higher incidence of acute closure, which may be related to preexisting thrombus. Resolution of this problem may be achieved by the use of more potent antiplatelet treatment, pretreatment with thrombolytic agents, or treatment that can be applied locally (e.g., laser energy, atherectomy) at the site of the unstable plaque. Results in this study have been obtained from selected groups of patients: those with predominantly single-vessel disease and well-preserved left ventricular function. It remains to be determined whether the same benefits can be achieved in patients with multivessel disease or in those who have severely reduced left ventricular function. \nBlood supply of nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia. The number of patients who suffer from radicular symptoms due to degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine is increasing. This article discusses the differences in anatomic structure between spinal nerve roots and peripheral nerves. Blood supply and cerebrospinal fluid flow are explained, and the effect of mechanical compression, direct and indirect, is shown as a possible cause of symptoms. \nRelative effects of diarrhea, fever, and dietary energy intake on weight gain in rural Bangladeshi children. Quantitative studies of morbidity, food intake, and somatic growth were done prospectively during 14 mo for 70 children aged 5-18 mo in two Bangladeshi villages. When random-effect regression models were used, monthly changes in weight were inversely related to proportions of days in the month with fever and diarrhea and positively related to energy intake per kilogram body weight. Interestingly, weight changes did not vary with age in this interval. Estimates indicate that increasing energy intakes to the recommended World Health Organization level would have a significantly greater effect on weight gain than would the elimination of diarrhea and fever. With energy at recommended intake and diarrhea and fever prevalence as found in US children, weight gain is predicted to be near that of the international reference population. Therefore, interventions aimed at improving dietary intake may be as important as infection-control programs for improving growth of children in poor developing nations. \nEffects of Vibrio cholerae recombinant strains on rabbit ileum in vivo. Enterotoxin production and myoelectric activity. Previous studies have identified the effects of Vibrio cholerae and its enterotoxin, choleragen (CT A+B+), on the myoelectric activity of rabbit ileal loops in vivo. The response was defined as the migrating action potential complex, the single ring contraction that propels luminal contents aborad. In this study the same rabbit model is used to assess whether migrating action potential complex activity or fluid output is induced by recombinant strains of V. cholerae that produce no subunit of cholera toxin (CT A-B-) or only by the inactive binding subunit (CT A-B+). Three live strains were studied: El Tor wild-type N16961 (CT A+B+) and recombinant strains CVD106 (CT A-B+) and JBK70 (CT A-B-). Controls received sterile culture broth. Migrating action potential complex frequency in animals inoculated with CT A+B+ was significantly increased compared with that in all other experimental groups (P less than 0.01). Fluid output was also increased in animals inoculated with CT A+B+ compared with fluid output in all other groups (P less than 0.05). Migrating action potential complex frequency and fluid output in rabbits given CT A-B+ or CT A-B- did not differ from activity in controls. How these recombinant strains induce diarrhea is unknown, but the mechanism may involve bacterial colonization or production of an unknown toxin. \nA phase II study of idarubicin in the treatment of measurable gastric cancer. Idarubicin is one of the new anthracycline analogues. It has a higher therapeutic index than either doxorubicin or daunorubicin in a variety of murine leukemias and solid tumors. The authors performed a multicenter Phase II trial of idarubicin in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Seventeen patients with measurable metastatic disease were entered into the trial and treated with idarubicin at a starting dose of 15 mg/m2. This dose was escalated or reduced according to toxicity. There were no documented responses. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. These data did not compared favourably with the data on doxorubicin in the treatment of gastric carcinoma. A conclusion could not be reached on whether idarubicin has minimal activity in the treatment of gastric carcinoma. \nFrequency of adverse systemic reactions after fluorescein angiography. Results of a prospective study. Intravenous fluorescein angiography is a commonly performed and extraordinarily valuable diagnostic procedure. The frequency of adverse reactions after angiography has varied considerably in previous reports. In a prospective study of 2789 angiographic procedures in 2025 patients, the authors found that the percentage of adverse reactions depended strongly on the patient's angiographic history. Overall, adverse reactions followed 4.8% of the angiographic procedures. These reactions included nausea (2.9%), vomiting (1.2%), flushing/itching/hives (0.5%), and other reactions (dyspnea, syncope, excessive sneezing) (0.2%). No cases of anaphylaxis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, or seizures occurred. The percentage of reactions was 1.8% for patients who had had previous angiography without ever having had an adverse reaction. In contrast, the percentage of reactions was 48.6% for patients who had had an adverse reaction to angiography previously. \nBudd-Chiari syndrome in Israel: predisposing factors, prognosis, and early identification of high-risk patients. In twenty-seven patients with venography-documented Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), underlying diseases included polycythemia vera (nine patients), membranous occlusion of the inferior vena cava (three), and cirrhosis (two). In only nine patients did the syndrome occur in the absence of any predisposing factor. All patients with a membranous web were relatively young (mean age 29 years) and were born in Morocco. With regard to prognosis, three groups could be delineated. Eight patients formed a rapidly progressive group, with mean survival from first symptom of only 4.3 weeks, and were characterized mainly by their relatively advanced age and minimal enlargement of the spleen. \nAbnormal coronary vasoconstriction as a predictor of restenosis after successful coronary angioplasty in patients with unstable angina pectoris. BACKGROUND. High rates of restenosis after coronary angioplasty have been reported in patients with vasospastic angina. This study was designed to determine whether the occurrence of abnormal coronary vasoconstriction, detected by means of hyperventilation testing before angioplasty, influences the risk of restenosis after successful dilation. METHODS. Hyperventilation testing was performed 0 to 4 days before coronary angioplasty in 106 consecutive patients with unstable angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease. Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was considered present if hyperventilation-induced myocardial ischemia occurred during the recovery phase of the test. All patients had follow-up angiography 8 to 12 months after angioplasty. RESULTS. Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was observed in 48 patients (group 1), whereas 58 patients (group 2) had either a negative response throughout the test or a positive response only during the overbreathing phase of the hyperventilation test. Angioplasty was successful in 40 patients in group 1 and 51 in group 2. Restenosis was documented in 29 patients (73 percent) in group 1 and 13 (25 percent) in group 2 (relative risk of restenosis, 2.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.69 to 4.28; P less than 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the following three characteristics were independently related to the risk of restenosis (in descending order of importance): ST-segment elevation during spontaneous ischemic attacks (P less than 0.001), hyperventilation-induced abnormal coronary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.001), and the presence of a lesion more than 10 mm long in the left anterior descending coronary artery (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. In patients with unstable angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease who have been selected for coronary angioplasty, the presence of hyperventilation-induced abnormal coronary vasoconstriction identifies a subgroup at high risk for restenosis. \nBlood analyses and survival in symptom- and survey-detected lung cancer patients. Commonly recorded blood analyses as indicators of low- and-high risk patients with lung cancer were studied by comparing symptom- and survey-detected patients. During the period 1976-1985, in 41 of 189 non-small-cell lung cancer patients in Western Norway, lung cancer was detected by chest X-ray survey performed in the preventive tuberculosis screening programme. After adjusting for other variables, including developmental stage, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was the only blood analysis which discriminated symptom-detected patients (high ESR) from survey-detected patients (low ESR). Survey-detected patients had a better short-term survival. In multivariate survival analyses leucocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase activity and ESR were significant prognostic factors, in addition to advanced stage and detection due to symptoms. We conclude that common blood analyses such as ESR provide supplementary information concerning low- and high-risk lung cancer patients. \nStorage of saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol-suspended red cells in a new plastic container: polyvinylchloride plasticized with butyryl-n-trihexyl-citrate. Blood collection and component preparation have been performed in integrally connected multiple plastic containers made with a new plastic. This polyvinylchloride (PVC) container plasticized with butyryl-n-trihexyl-citrate (BTHC) is a new material for blood storage; it contains no di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). After removal of plasma and buffy coat, the red cells were suspended in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM) medium. After 42-day refrigerator storage, the total adenine nucleotide concentrat",
