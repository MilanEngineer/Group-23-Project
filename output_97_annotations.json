        "text": "similar kinetics of induction. Exposure of cells to the stable cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP yielded dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine also inhibited proliferation. In contrast, neither H-7 nor HA1004 had an effect on growth inhibition induced by human natural IFN-alpha treatment. In addition, antiproliferative doses of IFN-alpha did not increase cAMP concentrations. These results indicate that the cAMP system is utilized by mismatched dsRNA as an early signal transduction mechanism for growth control. Furthermore, the antiproliferative effects induced by mismatched dsRNA and IFN can occur by different mechanisms of action. \nParental origin of the extra chromosome in trisomy 18. The parental origin of the supernumerary chromosome 18 was investigated by RFLP analysis in 23 individuals with Edwards syndrome. All families were studied with the DNA probe pERT-25, which recognizes a locus of highly polymorphic tandemly repeated DNA sequences on chromosome 18. The extra chromosome was found to be of maternal origin in 19 patients (95%), of paternal origin in one patient (5%), and indeterminate in three patients. In one of the three indeterminate cases, a mosaic, an apparent recombination event had taken place within the pERT-25 locus. The overall high degree of informativeness of pERT-25 illustrates the power of a chromosome-specific variable-number tandem repeat probe (VNTR) in parental origin studies of aneuploidy. \nMetabolic disturbance as a cause of recurrent hematuria in children. Metabolic disturbance as a cause of recurrent hematuria in children. To evaluate metabolic disturbance as a cause of hematuria, 250 children, aged eight months to fourteen years, with recurrent hematuria were studied. In the present series, metabolic disturbance was mainly due to idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH), the most common etiology of hematuria without proteinuria in childhood. Sixty-seven (27%) of the children had IH, ten children (4%) had hyperuricosuria, and 27 (11%) had nephrolithiasis. To better characterize the IH into renal (RH) or absorptive hypercalciuria (AH) subtypes, 45 of the 67 children (ranging age from six to twelve years) were further submitted to an oral calcium load test. Eighteen patients (40%) had AH, 7 (15.5%) RH and 20 (44.4%) could not be classified as having AH or RH [indeterminant (ID) idiopathic hypercalciuria group]. Intravenous pyelography or ultrasound were normal in all children. The oral calcium load test may be useful in characterizing the subtype of IH in some children; however, a great number of the IH children were characterized as indeterminant. Also hyperuricosuria, recently described as another metabolic disturbance associated with hematuria, may be an important cause of recurrent hematuria in children. \nThe nature of the naming deficit in Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. A comparison of naming performance, on the Boston Naming Test, of 52 patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), 16 patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and 52 normal control subjects was performed using a comprehensive classification of error types. Spontaneous and cued naming scores were significantly impaired both in the DAT and HD groups, but performance in the DAT patients was significantly worse than that of the HD patients. Normal controls made predominantly semantic-category and circumlocutory errors. The HD group differed from normal only in the proportion of visually based errors, which was greater in the patient group. By contrast, the DAT patients made a significantly greater proportion of semantic-superordinate and semantic-associative errors. The same pattern of naming errors was found when a group of DAT and HD patients matched for overall naming ability was compared. A subgroup of 22 DAT patients was followed longitudinally over 3 y. Their deterioration in overall naming performance was accompanied by a consistent change in the profile of naming errors: the proportion of semantic-associative errors increased significantly as did the proportion of visual errors. These results are considered in the light of current cognitive models of naming. They suggest that in HD, naming deficits initially involve disruption of perceptual analysis, whereas in DAT such impairments in the early stages reflect a breakdown in semantic processes. However, as DAT progresses, perceptual problems also begin to contribute to the patients' naming difficulties. Postlexical (phonemic) processes remain relatively intact throughout in both diseases. \nProstate specific antigen values after radical retropubic prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate: impact of adjuvant treatment (hormonal and radiation). Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were obtained before and after radical retropubic prostatectomy in 192 patients: 78 (41%) had pathological stage B2 cancer or less, 83 (43%) had stage C or C+ and 31 (16%) had stage D1 disease. Of those with stages B2 or less, C, C+ and D1 disease 82, 86, 65 and 90%, respectively, had postoperative PSA values of 0.2 ng./ml. or less (when first evaluated 30 or more days postoperatively). At 1 year postoperatively 94% of the stages C and C+ cancer patients treated with adjuvant radiation had PSA levels of 0.2 ng./ml. or less, which was significantly different from those not treated adjuvantly (p = 0.02). This effect of adjuvant radiation on PSA was temporary in the small number of patients with longer followup. Adjuvant orchiectomy for stage D1 lesions resulted in female PSA levels in virtually all cases. This decrease may be misleading and may reflect a direct hormonal effect rather than a decrease in tumor volume. Positive surgical margins did not significantly affect postoperative PSA levels, possibly because of the frequent use of adjuvant treatment. \nPlasma prostanoids in neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Influence of meconium aspiration. Thromboxane B2 may be a mediator of neonatal persistent pulmonary hypertension. Elevated levels of plasma thromboxane and prostacyclin have been described previously in hypoxic newborn infants with neonatal pulmonary hypertension. We measured serial plasma levels of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (stable metabolite of prostacyclin) in 21 newborn infants with severe respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. We sought to study (1) the evolution of plasma prostanoids in pulmonary hypertensive infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and (2) whether different pulmonary hypertensive diagnostic subgroups have distinctive prostanoid profiles. Our data indicated that infants with meconium aspiration had significantly lower levels of plasma thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha while receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than did infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension but no meconium aspiration. Levels of all infants decreased progressively as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support continued. \nLeft ventricular diastolic filling abnormalities identified by Doppler echocardiography in asymptomatic patients with sickle cell anemia. To determine whether left ventricular diastolic abnormalities are an early feature of sickle cell anemia, indexes of diastolic filling were obtained with pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 30 consecutive patients with this disease (mean age 29 years; range 19 to 39) who had not experienced symptoms of heart failure and had normal left ventricular systolic function. Data were compared with those in 30 normal control subjects of similar ages. Seventeen (57%) of the 30 patients with sickle cell anemia had evidence of abnormal left ventricular diastolic filling. Six of these 17 patients had a Doppler pattern consistent with \"restrictive\" filling, characterized by reduced early diastolic deceleration time (less than 110 ms) or an increased rate of decline of early flow velocity (EF slope greater than 7.4 m/s2), or both, as well as decreased late diastolic velocity-time integral (2.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.8 cm in normal subjects; p less than 0.05). Another 11 patients showed a Doppler waveform consistent with impaired relaxation, characterized by prolonged deceleration time (greater than 166 ms) or reduced EF slope (less than 3.8 m/s2), as well as increased late diastolic velocity-time integral (4.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.8 cm in normal subjects; p = 0.03). This Doppler echocardiographic analysis demonstrates that left ventricular diastolic filling patterns are altered in patients with sickle cell anemia and that these diastolic abnormalities may be present in the absence of symptoms of heart failure. These abnormal patterns suggest an intrinsic myocardial abnormality in patients with sickle anemia and may prove to be early markers of cardiac disease. \nSerum cholesterol and mortality among Japanese-American men. The Honolulu (Hawaii) Heart Program. Hawaiian men of Japanese ancestry followed up for 18 or more years after a baseline examination showed a quadratic distribution of death rates at different levels of serum cholesterol. Mortality from cancer progressively decreased and mortality from coronary heart disease progressively increased with rising levels of serum cholesterol. There was a positive association between baseline serum cholesterol levels and deaths from coronary heart disease at 0 to 6 years, 7 to 12 years, and 13 years and longer after examination. The inverse relationship between cancer and serum cholesterol levels was stronger in the first 6 years than in the next 6 years and, although still inverse, lost statistical significance after 13 years. Cancers of the colon and lung showed the strongest association with low baseline serum cholesterol levels, while gastric or rectal cancer failed to show this association. Organ specificity and persistence of the inverse association beyond 6 years suggest that the nutritional demands of cancers may not entirely explain the inverse association with some cancers. The quadratic distribution of deaths in this cohort remained after coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer were removed from the analysis. For the entire period of observation, the lowest mortalities were found in men with serum cholesterol levels between 4.65 and 6.18 mmol/L (between 180 and 239 mg/dL). Manipulation of serum cholesterol levels below this level would not be desirable if this were to result in increased risk of death from cancer or other disease. This study does not rule out this possibility. \nThe effect of elemental diet on intestinal permeability and inflammation in Crohn's disease. This study examines whether treatment of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet improves intestinal integrity and inflammation as assessed by a 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetatic acid (EDTA) permeability test and the fecal excretion of 111In-labeled autologous leukocytes, respectively. Thirty-four patients with active Crohn's disease completed a 4-week treatment course with an elemental diet. Active disease was characterized by increased intestinal permeability [24-hour urine excretion of orally administered 51Cr-EDTA, 6.4% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- SE); normal, less than 3.0%] and by high fecal excretion of 111In-labeled leukocytes (14.2% +/- 1.1%; normal, less than 1.0%). Twenty-seven (80%) went into clinical remission, usually within a week of starting treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, there was a significant decrease in both the urine excretion of 51Cr-EDTA (to 3.4% +/- 0.5%; P less than 0.01) and the fecal excretion of 111In (to 5.7% +/- 1.0%; P less than 0.001), indicating that such treatment is not just symptomatic. A framework for the mechanism by which elemental diet works, centering around the importance of the integrity of the intestinal barrier function, is proposed, and also appears to provide a logical explanation for some relapses of the disease. \nThe acetylcholine-induced flare response in evaluation of small fiber dysfunction. We iontophoresed acetylcholine on the dorsum of the foot and simultaneously measured flare and sweat responses using laser Doppler and sudorometric techniques, respectively. We compared these responses with those induced by histamine. Both acetylcholine and histamine produced dose-dependent flare, but only acetylcholine produced sweat responses. Responses to acetylcholine and histamine were blocked by hexamethonium chloride and pyrilamine maleate, respectively (p less than 0.01). We compared flare and sweat responses in 26 control subjects, 21 asymptomatic diabetic patients and 41 patients (17 diabetic, 24 nondiabetic) with pain symptoms suggestive of small fiber neuropathy and normal sensation (n = 15) or mild to moderate (n = 19) or severe (n = 7) sensory loss. No patient had trophic foot lesions. Basal skin blood flow and maximal flare responses were not significantly different among the various subgroups (Control subjects, 49 +/- 7.4; asymptomatic diabetic patients, 29 +/- 4; patients with small fiber neuropathy and normal sensation, 34 +/- 6; with neuropathy and mild to moderate sensory loss, 29 +/- 4.8; and with neuropathy and severe sensory loss, 35 +/- 5 ml/100 gm, for flare response, respectively). Flare responses lower than the lowest found in control subjects occurred in 5 of 21 asymptomatic diabetic patients, 4 of 15 patients with small fiber neuropathy and normal sensation, 5 of 19 with neuropathy and mild to moderate sensory loss, and 1 of 7 with neuropathy and severe sensory loss. \nThe sleep apnoea syndrome in obesity: risk of sudden death. A total of 34 severely obese men with a history of heavy snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness indicative of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) were studied prospectively. Their mean age was 46 years, and mean body mass index was 41.6 kg m-2. During a 4-year follow-up, 15% (5/34) of these subjects died (three cases of acute myocardial infarction and two cases of pulmonary oedema), all of them suddenly and unexpectedly, outside hospital. On autopsy the degree of atherosclerosis was found to be moderate in all cases. In 68% (15/22) of the men a pathological apnoea index (mean value 46 +/- 20) confirmed the OSAS diagnosis. Exercise tests and neurological examinations did not reveal any other causes of daytime sleepiness. Mean blood pressure at rest and during exercise was normal, and mean serum lipid and blood glucose levels were normal. Spirometry revealed intrapulmonary restrictive changes that could not be attributed to the heavy thoracic wall. Compliance was reduced to about 50% of reference values, and the mean pCO2 level (5.8 kPa) was close to the upper reference limit. Blood tests suggested that high alcohol consumption may be an important factor contributing to OSAS. These results demonstrate that morbidly obese men with a history of OSAS have a high risk of sudden cardiovascular death, despite the absence of other conventional risk factors. \nLymphocytic adenohypophysitis: an immunohistochemical study. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is a rare inflammatory disorder of the anterior pituitary gland. In some cases, there is evidence of concurrent autoimmune disease. We present the case of a 39-year-old woman who developed visual disturbance during the early postpartum period. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intrasellar mass with suprasellar extension. Study of the tumor tissue showed diffuse infiltration of the entire pituitary gland by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the majority of the infiltrating lymphocytes were T cells that might have modulated the immunoreaction to the anterior pituitary gland. We suggest that the disorder is related to cell-mediated immunity as well as humoral immunity. \nAlcoholic cirrhosis and osteoporosis in men: a light and scanning electron microscopy study. Subjects with chronic alcoholism are associated with a higher prevalence of bone fractures, compared with age-matched controls. However, the pathogenesis of alcoholic osteopathy remains poorly understood. In this study, the bone cells activities and the bone matrix were studied using different techniques such as bone morphometry, scanning electron microscopy and computer reconstruction. Male patients (N = 20), aged 59.1 +/- 10.1 years, presenting a chronic decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, were admitted into this study. A histomorphometric analysis of a transiliac bone biopsy was done after a double tetracycline labeling of the bone. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study was performed on eight out of the 20 patients on an additional biopsy. The bone mass was significantly decreased in cirrhotic patients. A marked defect in the osteoblastic function was observed with reduced osteoid parameters, lower mean wall thickness, and slower bone formation rate leading to a thinning of bone trabeculae. Conversely, trabecular resorption surfaces were markedly increased. SEM examination of bone biopsies was also consistent with delayed and impaired osteoblastic activity leading to extended and scalloped resorption surfaces covered by unusually thin layers of calcified collagen fibers. The reduced osteoblastic activity associated with normal osteoclastic function appears to play a major role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic osteoporosis leading to decreased bone mass with thinner trabeculae. \nQuantification of ST-segment changes during coronary angioplasty in patients with left bundle branch block. Electrocardiographic manifestations of ischemia are difficult to interpret in the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Recently developed techniques allow continuous computerized digital analysis of ST segments that can be zeroed to the patient's own baseline electrocardiogram even if that baseline is abnormal conduction. With use of this technology, ST-segment changes during balloon coronary occlusion were compared in 10 patients with LBBB versus an age-, sex-, and coronary anatomy-matched population of 20 control subjects with normal baseline conduction. ST-segment deviation of greater than or equal to 1 mm from baseline was present in 80% of patients with LBBB and in 75% of control patients (difference not significant). There was no significant difference between patients with LBBB versus control patients in maximal ST-segment deviation (2.6 +/- 1.7 vs 2.0 +/- 1.0 mm) or in ST-segment deviation measured after 60 seconds of occlusion (2.4 +/- 1.3 vs 1.8 +/- 1.1 mm). ST-segment deviation reached 1 mm more quickly in patients with LBBB (33 +/- 11 seconds) than in control subjects (60 +/- 36 seconds) (p = 0.003). It is concluded that ST-segment analysis is feasible in patients with LBBB using digital self-referenced ST analysis and may provide important clinical information regarding the presence of myocardial ischemia. \nThe role of echocardiography in the evaluation of mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. With the introduction of the coronary care unit and more effective therapy for primary life-threatening arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock and the mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction are now responsible for the majority of in-hospital deaths. These mechanical complications, which include myocardial rupture of the left ventricular free wall, rupture of the ventricular septum, and rupture of the papillary muscle, are estimated to account for 25,000 fatalities yearly in the United States. Although the mechanism of myocardial rupture has not been clearly defined, there is increasing evidence that infarct expansion, which can be readily detected by two-dimensional echocardiography, may be an important pathophysiologic factor. The ready availability of echocardiography in the coronary care unit has made a major impact on the immediate diagnosis of mechanical complications in the hemodynamically compromised patient with acute myocardial infarction. In particular, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic techniques have been extremely useful in the identification and localization of ventricular septal rupture. In addition, papillary muscle rupture can be readily diagnosed by Doppler approaches and is easily distinguished from ventricular septal rupture. In view of increasing evidence that early surgical intervention is indicated in these patients, these echocardiographic approaches offer the surgeon prompt diagnostic and anatomic information. Unfortunately, rupture of the free wall of the left ventricle often results in sudden death within minutes before echocardiographic evaluation can be attempted. Nevertheless, rapid echocardiographic diagnosis provides the patient with the possibility of potential life-saving resuscitative interventions before immediate surgery. Thus, over the past decade, echocardiography has become a vital tool in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. The development of Doppler techniques, color flow Doppler, and esophageal approaches should further enhance our diagnostic abilities and allow careful monitoring of patients before, during, and after surgical repair. It is hoped that with the improvements in echocardiographic evaluation of mechanical rupture and more rapid surgical intervention, future studies will demonstrate better surgical results with good long-term survival in patients with myocardial rupture. \nTreatment of Parkinson's disease with proglumide, a CCK antagonist. Proglumide, a cholecystokinin antagonist, did not improve Parkinson's disease in a preliminary drug treatment trial. \nLeukoaraiosis correlates with cerebral hypoperfusion in vascular dementia. Leukoaraiosis quantified by computerized densitometric measurements of reduced Hounsfield numbers was correlated with local cerebral blood flow on the same computed tomographic images of 35 patients with multi-infarct dementia and 16 age-matched elderly normal volunteers. The ratio for area of frontal leukoaraiosis to total area of parenchyma among the patients was significantly greater than that among the normal volunteers (5.8 +/- 2.3% compared with 3.1 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.001). Severity of leukoaraiosis around the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles correlated significantly with severity of leukoaraiosis of the centrum semiovale adjacent to the bodies of the lateral ventricles. Cerebral blood flow values for all representative cerebral regions except the parietal white matter were reduced among the patients compared with the normal volunteers. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that reduced cerebral perfusion in the putamen and thalamus correlated significantly with the severity of leukoaraiosis. Cerebral hypoperfusion in territories supplied by deep penetrating arteries may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukoaraiosis. \nMuir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and cutaneous vasculitis. Report of a case with exacerbation of a cutaneous neoplasm during immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a patient with both Muir-Torre syndrome and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. A keratoacanthoma developed after immunosuppressive therapy for necrotizing vasculitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. \nPerioperative morbidity and mortality of gynecologic brachytherapy. The incidence and nature of perioperative complications associated with gynecologic brachytherapy applications were determined in 462 implants performed on 327 patients with cervical, endometrial, or vaginal cancer from 1986 to 1988. Twenty-one patients (6.4%) had life-threatening complications, including cardiac (16 patients), thromboembolic (4 patients), and pulmonary (1 patient) events. Three complications (0.9%) were fatal within the first 30 days, and two patients died of delayed sequelae of perioperative complications; thus, there was an overall 1.5% mortality rate. Patients experiencing life-threatening complications tended to be older (P = 0.0002), and to have a history of cardiac disease (P = 0.0002) and an increased American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (P = 0.003). Logistic analysis demonstrated that a history of cardiac disease and increased age were independent predictors of life-threatening complications (P = 0.01). Careful patient selection and intensive perioperative care of the high-risk patient may prove to substantially diminish these complications. \nDemonstration of viraemia patterns in haemophiliacs treated with hepatitis-C-virus-contaminated factor VIII concentrates. Sequential serum samples from previously untreated haemophiliacs in whom non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) developed after they received factor VIII concentrate contaminated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) were tested by a commercial assay for the presence of antibodies to the C100 protein of HCV (anti-C100) and by \"nested\" PCR for the presence of HCV RNA sequences. Three temporal patterns of viraemia were observed: transient viraemia in acute resolving NANBH; viraemia lasting for several years in chronic NANBH; and intermittent viraemia in chronic NANBH, with an initial transient phase followed by recurrence after many months. In three of five cases the initial detection of serum HCV RNA was made before the onset of liver function test abnormality, many weeks or months before anti-C100 seroconversion. Diagnosis of acute HCV infection may therefore be possible much earlier by PCR than by existing serological techniques, but the timing of samples may be critical. \nTwenty-four-hour activity of felodipine extended release in chronic stable angina pectoris. To investigate the antiischemic efficacy and duration of action of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine, 15 patients with stable exertional angina were enrolled in a double-blind, crossover study comparing 2 doses (5 and 10 mg) of felodipine extended release (ER) and placebo given once daily for 1 week. Bicycle exercise tests were repeated at the end of each treatment period 4 and 24 hours after dosing. Four hours after dosing with both felodipine doses, only 5 patients discontinued the exercise test because of greater than 2 mm of ST-segment depression, whereas 10 continued until exhaustion (p less than 0.01 vs placebo). Compared with placebo, total exercise time was increased by 19% (p less than 0.001), with no difference between doses. After 24 hours, exercise duration was prolonged up to physical exhaustion in 6 patients taking felodipine 10 mg (p less than 0.05 vs both placebo and felodipine 5 mg); moreover, 11 patients taking 10 mg and 5 taking 5 mg increased time to 1 mm of ST depression greater than or equal to 15% compared with exercise time during the placebo test. Mean time to 1 mm of ST depression at 24 hours was increased by 8% with 5 mg and by 18% with 10 mg (p less than 0.001 vs placebo; p less than 0.01 between doses). Total exercise time at 24 hours was increased with both doses (p less than 0.001), with greater efficacy with the 10-mg dose (p less than 0.05 vs 5 mg). \nAdministration of thyroxine in treated Graves' disease. Effects on the level of antibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors and on the risk of recurrence of hyperthyroidism BACKGROUND. Antibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors that stimulate the thyroid gland cause hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease, and their production during antithyroid drug treatment is an important determinant of the course of the disease. One factor that might contribute to the persistent production of antibodies to TSH receptors is stimulation of the release of thyroid antigens by TSH during antithyroid drug therapy. We therefore studied the effect of the suppression of TSH secretion by thyroxine on the levels of antibodies to TSH receptors after thyroid hormone secretion had been normalized by methimazole. METHODS AND RESULTS. The levels of antibodies to TSH receptors were measured during treatment with methimazole, either alone or in combination with thyroxine, in 109 patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. The patients first received 30 mg of methimazole daily for six months. All were euthyroid after six months, and their mean (+/- SD) level of antibodies to TSH receptors decreased from 64 +/- 9 percent to 25 +/- 15 percent (P less than 0.01; normal, 2.9 +/- 1.4 percent). Sixty patients then received 100 micrograms of thyroxine and 10 mg of methimazole and 49 received placebo and 10 mg of methimazole daily for one year. In the thyroxine-treated group, the mean serum thyroxine concentration increased from 108 +/- 16 nmol per liter to 145 +/- 11 nmol per liter (P less than 0.01), and the level of antibodies to TSH receptors decreased from 28 +/- 10 percent to 10 +/- 3 percent after one month of combination therapy. In the patients who received placebo and methimazole, the mean serum thyroxine concentration decreased and the level of antibodies to TSH receptors did not change. Methimazole, but not thyroxine or placebo, was discontinued in each group 1 1/2 years after the beginning of treatment. The level of antibodies to TSH receptors further decreased (from 6.6 +/- 3.2 percent at the time methimazole was discontinued to 2.1 +/- 1.2 percent one year later) in the patients who continued to receive thyroxine, but it increased (from 9.1 +/- 4.8 percent to 17.3 +/- 5.8 percent during the same period) in the patients who received placebo. One patient in the thyroxine-treated group (1.7 percent) and 17 patients in the placebo group (34.7 percent) had recurrences of hyperthyroidism within three years after the discontinuation of methimazole. CONCLUSIONS. The administration of thyroxine during antithyroid drug treatment decreases both the production of antibodies to TSH receptors and the frequency of recurrence of hyperthyroidism. \nVessel associated adhesion molecules in normal skin and acute graft-versus-host disease. Immunohistological staining of skin from normal donors and bone marrow transplant recipients was undertaken using antibodies to two vessel associated adhesion molecules, endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1). In normal skin ELAM-1 staining was restricted to a variable but generally small number of endothelial cells which were significantly increased in graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), but only when the fully developed histological picture of epidermal basal damage and leucocytic infiltration was present. All other biopsy specimens from marrow recipients taken before or after transplantation were similar to those of normal controls even in the presence of a clinical rash consistent with early GvHD. Although VCAM-1 positivity was seen on a few endothelial cells in normal skin, staining was mainly observed on dermal dendritic cells surrounding blood vessels and adnexal structures. In specimens with histological evidence of GvHD, positive perivascular dendritic cells were increased and were accompanied by the appearance of large numbers of similar cells dispersed throughout the upper dermis. Biopsy specimens from marrow recipients before and after transplantation resembled those from normal donors except for the presence of a rash after transplantation when some specimens, which lacked the leucocytic infiltrate diagnostic of GvHD, showed an increase in VCAM-1 positive cells, particularly in the upper dermis. The identification of these cells may therefore be useful in diagnosing early GvHD. \nIntensive chemotherapy induction followed by interferon-alpha maintenance in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. In a pilot study, 32 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia were treated with intensive chemotherapy induction followed by interferon-alpha (IFN-A) maintenance. Intensive chemotherapy consisted of three cycles of daunorubicin 120 mg/m2 on day 1, cytarabine 80 mg/m2 daily for 10 days, vincristine 2 mg on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg daily for 5 days (DOAP). Maintenance therapy with IFN-A at a doses of 3 x 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) units/m2 daily was adjusted according to counts and toxicity. The outcome of patients was compared with a matched historic population of 64 patients treated with IFN-A alone. Overall, 60% of patients had a cytogenetic response (partial or complete) with induction chemotherapy, but only eight (25%) had a sustained cytogenetic response with IFN-A maintenance. After a median follow-up of 67 months, the 6-year survival rate of the 32 patients was 58%, compared with 36% for the matched historic group (P = 0.084). The incidence of lymphoid blastic transformation in the two groups was 25% and 48%, respectively (P = 0.10) and durable cytogenetic responses, 25% and 19%, respectively (P = 0.48). In summary, the addition of intensive chemotherapy induction to IFN-A maintenance does not improve the survival rate, incidence of lymphoid blastic transformation, or incidence of durable cytogenetic response compared with the results achieved with IFN-A therapy alone. \nDeterminants of perinatal outcome in pregnancy-induced hypertension with absence of umbilical artery end-diastolic frequencies. Forty-three pregnancies that were complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension and either absence of umbilical artery end-diastolic frequencies (n = 32) or reversal of umbilical artery end-diastolic frequencies (n = 11) were reviewed. The incidence of perinatal mortality and morbidity was similar for the two Doppler patterns. Perinatal survival was highly dependent on the gestational age when hypertension first appeared. Presentation at greater than or equal to 30 weeks' gestation was associated with a perinatal survival rate of 86%. Presentation at less than 30 weeks' gestation was associated with a perinatal survival rate of 38% (p less than 0.005). Pregnancy-induced hypertension that presented before 30 weeks was more often associated with a 5-minute Apgar score less than 7 (p less than 0.005) and a nonreactive nonstress test (p less than 0.05) compared with pregnancy-induced hypertension that presented at or beyond 30 weeks. For pregnancies that presented before 30 weeks, the only difference between perinatal survivors (n = 11) and perinatal deaths (n = 18) was a higher incidence of birth weight at or below the 10th percentile among deaths (p = 0.02). \nSudden death and paroxysmal autonomic dysfunction in stiff-man syndrome. Two women with typical stiff-man syndrome (SMS) developed increasingly frequent attacks of muscle spasms with severe paroxysmal autonomic dysfunctions such as transient hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, pupillary dilation, and arterial hypertension. Autoantibodies to GABA-ergic neurons were identified in the serum of both patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of one. Both died suddenly and unexpectedly. General autopsy did not reveal the cause of death. Neuropathological studies revealed perivascular gliosis in the spinal cord and brain stem of one patient and lymphocytic perivascular infiltration in the spinal cord, brain stem, and basal ganglia of the other. The occurrence of a chronic inflammatory reaction in one of the two patients supports the idea that an autoimmune disease against GABA-ergic neurons may be involved in SMS. A review of the literature indicates that functional impairment in SMS is severe and prognosis is unpredictable because of the potential for sudden and unexpected death. Both muscular abnormalities and autonomic dysfunctions may result from autoimmunity directed against GABA-ergic neurons. \nA new point mutation in the 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine-binding domain of the c-erbA beta thyroid hormone receptor is tightly linked to generalized thyroid hormone resistance. Two different mutations in the c-erbA beta thyroid hormone receptor have recently been reported as genetic abnormalities responsible for the syndrome of generalized thyroid hormone resistance (GTHR). We have now found in a third kindred, D, in which GTHR is inherited as a dominant disease, a new point mutation in the T3-binding domain of c-erbA beta. A guanine to cytosine base substitution at nucleotide position 1305, which altered codon-335 from glutamine (CAG) to histidine (CAC), was found in one allele of 10 affected members and was not found in 6 unaffected members. This C-1305 sequence was not present in 106 random alleles, indicating that it was a mutation in c-erbA beta, and it was tightly linked to GTHR in kindred D, with a maximum logarithm of the odds score of 4.19 at a recombination fraction of 0. The tight linkage result confirms that GTHR maps to the c-erbA beta locus in multiple kindreds. In view of the tight linkage between the C-1305 mutation and GTHR, and that this mutation is a nonconservative alteration in a crucial region of the T3-binding domain, it is probably the genetic defect in kindred D responsible for GTHR. The kindred D receptor appears to result in a different phenotype of tissue resistance compared to the previously reported kindred. A receptor with a mutation in the carboxy-terminus of c-erbA beta. \nRelationship between the timing of aneurysm surgery and the development of delayed cerebral ischemia. A consecutive series of 145 patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were operated on within 7 days of SAH and were prospectively evaluated over a 4-year period to determine if the timing of aneurysm surgery influenced the development of delayed cerebral ischemia. All patients were managed with a standardized policy of urgent surgical clipping and treatment with aggressive prophylactic postoperative volume expansion. Patients with delayed ischemic symptoms were additionally treated with induced hypertension. Forty-nine patients underwent surgery on Day 0 or 1 (Group 1) post-SAH, 60 patients on Day 2 or 3 (Group 2), and 36 patients on Days 4 through 7 (Group 3). Postoperative delayed cerebral ischemia developed in 16% of (Group 1) patients, in 22% of Group 2 patients, and in 28% of Group 3 patients. Cerebral infarction resulting from delayed cerebral ischemia developed in only 4% of Group 1 patients, 10% of Group 2 patients, and 11% of Group 3 patients. A bad clinical outcome as a result of delayed cerebral ischemia occurred in one Group 1 patient (2%), two Group 2 patients (3%), and one Group 3 patient (3%). Preoperative grade was not significantly correlated with the incidence or severity of delayed cerebral ischemia at any time interval except that patients in modified Hunt and Hess Grade I or II who underwent surgery on Day 0 or 1 after SAH had no strokes or bad outcomes from delayed cerebral ischemia. This study demonstrates that there is no rationale for delaying aneurysm surgery based on the time interval between SAH and patient evaluation. \nSpecial diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in elderly patients with upper gastrointestinal disease. Special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations apply to older patients with upper gastrointestinal disease. Age-related anatomical and physiologic changes occur in the major organ systems, affecting functions as diverse as swallowing and hepatic and renal clearance of therapeutic drugs. Because of these factors, and because older patients are more likely to be receiving multiple drugs for concomitant illness, they are more prone to drug-drug interactions and to medication-induced injury of the esophagus and stomach. In addition, several gastrointestinal disorders, notably gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease, are commonly seen in the elderly. This report reviews those age-related system changes that affect the gastrointestinal tract, and also reviews the esophageal and gastric disorders that are common and/or particularly problematic in the elderly. Diagnostic techniques to evaluate gastrointestinal disease in older patients and approaches to therapy for this population are described as well. \nBedside diagnosis of preserved versus impaired left ventricular systolic function in heart failure. The importance of recognizing symptomatic heart failure with preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function has only recently been appreciated. To determine its frequency and identify clinical features that make the bedside diagnosis likely, 82 patients admitted for decompensated heart failure were classified into 2 groups based on their LV systolic performance, as defined by fractional shortening (FS): group I (n = 59), with impaired systolic function (fractional shortening less than 24%), and group II (n = 23) with preserved systolic function (fractional shortening greater than or equal to 24%). Mean fractional shortening was 15 +/- 5% and 39 +/- 1% for groups I and II, respectively. Female gender (p less than 0.05), obesity (p less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) predominated in group II. Jugular venous distention was identified more frequently in group I (p less than 0.05). No statistically significant difference between the 2 groups was noted among various demographic variables (age, duration of symptoms, history of hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heavy alcohol drinking) or physical findings (S3 gallop, edema, cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion and pulmonary edema). Echocardiographic mean left ventricular dimension measured 6.6 +/- 1 versus 5.0 +/- 1 cm (p less than 0.01) and mean posterior wall thickness 1.1 +/- 0.3 versus 1.4 +/- 0.4 cm (p less than 0.01) in group I and II, respectively. The combination of diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg and an absence of jugular venous distention had a high specificity and positive predictive value (100%) for identifying group II patients. \nTolerance and safety of pharmacologic coronary vasodilation with adenosine in association with thallium-201 scintigraphy in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Adenosine thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy is a promising test for coronary artery disease detection, but its safety has not been reported in large patient cohorts. Accordingly, the tolerance and safety profile of adenosine infusion were analyzed in 607 patients (351 men, 256 women, mean age 63 +/- 11 years) undergoing this test either because of suspected coronary artery disease (Group I, n = 482) or for risk stratification early (5.2 +/- 2.8 days) after myocardial infarction (Group II, n = 125). Adenosine increased the heart rate from 74.5 +/- 14.0 to 91.8 +/- 15.9 beats/min (p less than 0.001) and decreased systolic blood pressure from 137.8 +/- 26.8 to 120.7 +/- 26.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Side effects were frequent and similar in both groups. Flushing occurred in 35%, chest pain in 34%, headache in 21% and dyspnea in 19% of patients. Only 35.6% of Group I patients with chest pain during adenosine infusion had concomitant transient perfusion abnormalities, compared with 60.7% of Group II patients (p less than 0.05). First- and second-degree AV block occurred in 9.6% and 3.6% of patients, respectively, and ischemic ST changes in 12.5% of cases. Concomitance of chest pain and ischemic ST depression was uncommon (6%) but, when present, predicted perfusion abnormalities in 73% of patients. Most side effects ceased rapidly after stopping the adenosine infusion. The side effects were severe in only 1.6% of patients and in only six patients (1%) was it necessary to discontinue the infusion. No serious adverse reactions such as acute myocardial infarction or death occurred. \nPituitary microcirculation: physiological aspects and clinical implications. A laser-Doppler flow study during transsphenoidal adenomectomy. The anterior and posterior pituitary lobes (AL and PL, respectively) are assumed to differ in the type of vascular supply and structure of their microvascular networks. Animal experiments have shown that the pituitary microvascular flow differs between the two lobes, being extremely high in the PL and low in the AL. For technical reasons, it has hitherto not been possible to study pituitary microflow in humans. Laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is now a well-established method for real-time monitoring of microcirculation, applicable also in humans. In a prospective clinical study, the microflow in the AL and PL was measured during transsphenoidal microsurgery in 52 patients with adenomas of different size, growth characteristics, and endocrinological activity. The mean microflow in the PL (177.7 +/- 12.6 [flux]) was found to be about six times higher than that in the AL (27.4 +/- 2.7 [flux]). No difference in the laser-Doppler fractional volume of the lobes could be detected (0.73 +/- 0.06 [] vs. 0.77 +/- 0.07 [], where [] designates the ratio of the alternating current output to the direct current output signals). Microflow within the pituitary lobes was influenced neither by the histological type nor the size of the adenoma. Additionally, LDF signal-averaging triggered by the electrocardiogram allowed detection of different characteristic pulsatile microvascular flow patterns in the AL and PL. Our findings provide strong physiological support for the idea that the angioarchitecture of the pituitary lobes differs. With this method, the AL and PL can be identified objectively during surgery. LDF might provide useful information concerning intraoperative surgical approach. \nThe dorsal rat flap: a discussion of the model and the salutary effect of cimetidine on flap survival. Failure of skin flaps remains a significant clinical problem. The dorsal rat flap, a reliable experimental model, was used to test the efficacy of cimetidine in treating a failing flap. Flaps were elevated in 45 rats divided into three equal groups. Group 1 was a saline control group, Group 2 received cimetidine 250 mg/kg three times a day for 7 days postoperatively, and Group 3 received cimetidine for 1 day before surgery, and then as in Group 2. Necrosis was assessed on the seventh postoperative day. Group 2 had 31.1 +/- 1.3 (mean % +/- SEM) necrosis, significantly better than saline control animals (p less than 0.01) and pretreated animals (p less than 0.05). These results suggest the usefulness of cimetidine in ischemic flap surgery. \nMicrovascular permeability increases early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury. To test the hypothesis that microvascular injury is involved in the pathophysiology of acid-induced esophagitis, the effect of acid perfusion on intraluminal plasma protein loss was studied in relation to histological changes. Four groups of opossums (n = 6 in each) were perfused with either normal saline control) or 10, 20, or 100 mmol/L isoosmolar hydrochloric acid at 2 mL/min for 90 minutes using a midesophageal catheter. The distal esophagus was cannulated via a gastrostomy, and the effluent was collected and measured for intraluminal loss of IV injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. Plasma protein loss in the control group was constant with a total loss of 3.40 +/- 0.69 mg/g dry wt. Perfusion of 10, 20, and 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid increased total protein loss to 8.06 +/- 2.62, 13.94 +/- 2.72, and 27.34 +/- 4.34 mg/g dry wt, respectively. The protein loss was not associated with intraluminal blood loss, as measured by previously injected 51Cr-labeled autologous red blood cells. Histological changes, scored by a blinded observer, were significant only between control animals and those perfused with 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid. Separate studies using the vascular tracer monastral blue B demonstrated an increase in labeling of lamina propria blood vessels that varied directly with the concentration of acid perfusate, thereby providing direct morphological evidence of microvascular injury. These studies suggest that increased microvascular permeability occurs early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury. \nAcute familial myositis with a common autoimmune response. In 1986, we diagnosed and treated 4 patients, all members of 1 rural family, who presented simultaneously with a polymyositis-like syndrome, anticytoplasmic antibodies (on HEp-2 cells), and precipitating antibodies of anti-Jo-1 and anti-PM-Scl specificities. Serum samples from these patients reacted by immunodiffusion against serum from a rodent that had been caught in the patients' house. The precipitin line showed complete immunologic identity with anti-Jo-1. To study the specificity of this serum-serum reaction, 2 mice (Mus musculus) and 1 rat (Rattus rattus) from the neighboring areas of the patients' house were caught and killed. Sections of the liver, kidney, spleen, and skeletal muscle were processed for histopathologic examination and for direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies of the patients' sera. The rodents' sera were tested by immunodiffusion against serum samples from 25 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 11 with rheumatoid arthritis, 6 with mixed connective tissue disease, and 11 with various other rheumatic diseases, as well as 16 healthy controls. A serum-serum precipitin reaction was noted between the rodents' sera and sera from 2 of the patients with polymyositis-like syndrome. A distinct, but weaker, reaction was found with 2 lupus patients' sera (8%), and with 1 healthy control serum (6%). The rodents' sera were antinuclear antibody positive by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells. These results, suggest that some rodents could be carriers of an as-yet-unknown transmissible agent that, in susceptible individuals, induces clinical and serologic manifestations similar to those of polymyositis. \nOsteoradionecrosis of sphenoid and temporal bones in a patient with maxillary sinus carcinoma: a case report. A case of radionecrosis of sphenoid and temporal bones is reported. The patient received a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for his left maxillary sinus carcinoma. After the combined therapy, necrosis accompanying inflammation developed in the maxillary and temporal regions. Excision of the necrotic tissues was done, and the left ascending ramus of the mandible was resected because of persistent tumor mass at the left infratemporal fossa. Although the excision wound of the maxilla healed by epithelialization, an area of nonvital bone remained exposed in the temporal region, where progressive osteonecrosis with infection led to breakdown of the skin. The necrotic bones of the zygomatic arch and the sphenotemporal sutural region became visible through the skin defect, and computerized tomography scan revealed bone necrosis involving the inferolateral area and the base of the skull. Excision of the necrotic bone and reconstruction with sternocleidomastoid myocutaneous flap were performed. \nNeonatal schizencephaly: comparison of brain imaging. Schizencephaly is a regional disturbance of cerebral hemisphere formation occurring at 3-5 months gestation; neonatal presentation is uncommon. Three neonates with schizencephaly were evaluated with cranial ultrasonography (US), unenhanced computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Common findings in US, CT, and MRI include parasylvian and midline clefts, size asymmetries of the basal ganglia and thalamus, cerebral parenchymal volume loss, ventriculomegaly, ventricular diverticula, and absence of the septum pellucidum. MRI and CT were superior to US in detecting calcification, gyral and sulcal abnormalities, and parasylvian clefts. MRI alone demonstrated homolateral absence of the sylvian vasculature, small medullary pyramids, low position of the fornix, and the thinning of the corpus callosum. Although US appears adequate as a screening test, MRI best defines the precise pathoanatomic findings of neonatal schizencephaly and allows for the prediction of neurologic outcomes in affected newborns. \nUse of photodynamic therapy in the palliation of massive advanced rectal cancer. Phase I/II study. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively new form of cancer therapy utilizing a photosensitizer such as hematoporphyrin derivative. We conducted a pilot study to determine the efficacy of its use in palliating advanced rectal cancer, to determine toxicity, and to establish objective outcome criteria. Six patients with very advanced, usually recurrent rectal cancer were treated with PDT after being photosensitized with Photofrin II. A protocol was established to measure clinical and radiologic response to therapy. A new intraluminal delivery system was incorporated. Five patients had both clinical and radiologic responses to therapy. In two patients we observed such significant responses that they cannot be accounted for on a photobiologic basis alone. One patient developed a significant sunburn after discharge. There was no major toxicity of bleeding or sepsis even at maximum doses (200 J/cm2). We are confident that PDT has a role to play in rectal cancer and speculate as to future applications. \nResults of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty as a palliative procedure in tetralogy of Fallot Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was attempted in 67 patients with tetralogy of Fallot at a median age of 5 months (range 0.03 to 52 months) for relief of cyanosis. In three patients, the valve could not be crossed and an aortopulmonary shunt was performed. In 35 patients, follow-up angiography was performed 3 to 30 months (average 12) after valvuloplasty. In 24 of these 35 patients (group A), the stenosis had been adequately palliated by valvuloplasty; the other 11 patients (group B) had required an aortopulmonary shunt 1 month (range 0 to 3 months) after valvuloplasty. The two groups were similar (p greater than 0.1) with respect to age at valvuloplasty, pulmonary anulus diameter, ratio of pulmonary artery to descending aorta diameter before valvuloplasty and interval to follow-up angiography. In contrast to patients in group B, patients in group A had a significant immediate improvement in systemic arterial oxygen saturation (p less than 0.01) and a significant increase in pulmonary anulus diameter at follow-up angiography (p less than 0.001). The growth of the branch pulmonary arteries was similar (p greater than 0.1) in the two groups. Among 42 patients who have had surgical correction, a transannular patch for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction was used in 27 (64%); there was no difference between groups A and B with respect to its use. Eight patients died (three after repair) and death could not be directly attributed to valvuloplasty in any. Balloon valvuloplasty promotes growth of the pulmonary valve anulus and pulmonary arteries and is a useful alternative to an aortopulmonary shunt in patients with small pulmonary arteries or associated complex intracardiac defects. \nMetastatic properties of the human prostatic cell line, PPC-1, in athymic nude mice. Limitation in the number of human prostatic cell lines has created a gap in knowledge regarding the in-vivo progression of this common cancer. The recently isolated primary prostatic carcinoma cell line, PPC-1, has been shown to be tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. These cells are now shown to form metastases to secondary sites in 10 of 12 animals in this initial study. Metastases were localized to lung and lymph nodes, and the tumor histology closely resembled that of the undifferentiated, rapidly dividing primary tumors. This is the first report describing the metastatic properties of a primary prostatic cancer cell line. PPC-1 cells are therefore likely to represent a good model system for the study of human prostate cancer progression. \nMyocardial calcifications in neonates and infants: a unique tissue reaction. The deposit of calcium salts into myocardial cells represents the process of dystrophic calcification. Once it causes alterations in cellular calcium hemostasis, it can initiate deleterious events leading to ischemic myocardial injury and cell death. Myocardial calcifications in infants are markedly different from those in adults; calcifications are significantly more frequent in cases of myocardial necrosis in the young, and can be demonstrated microscopically without removal of necrotic fibers and scar formation, which are the adult's usual stages of response to myocardial necrosis. Important functional and clinical implications in myocardial calcification, other than serving as a marker for necrosis, relate to accelerated myocardial calcification after cardiac surgery in infants. \nProspective randomized trial comparing anal function after hand sewn ileoanal anastomosis with mucosectomy versus stapled ileoanal anastomosis without mucosectomy in restorative proctocolectomy. A prospective randomized trial was performed to compare complications and function after hand sewn ileoanal anastomosis with mucosectomy (group A) with stapled ileoanal anastomosis without mucosectomy (group B) during restorative proctocolectomy. Thirty-two age- and sex-matched consecutive patients under the care of one surgeon were randomized. The median duration of anal dilatation while making the anastomosis was 19 min (range 14-33 min) and 1 min (range 0-39 min) in groups A and B respectively (P less than 0.005). The median level of the anastomosis was at the dentate line (range 0-0.5 cm) in group A and 2 cm above the dentate line (range 0.2-4.0 cm) in group B (P less than 0.005). Seven patients in group A and 11 in group B had at least one postoperative complication (n.s.). One patient in group A and four in group B developed an anastomotic stricture requiring dilatation (n.s.). One patient in group B had the reservoir removed. Function was assessed at a median of 11 months (range 7-15 months) after ileostomy closure in 14 patients in group A, and at a median of 12 months (range 5-17 months) in 14 patients in group B. Median frequency of defaecation per 24 h was 4 in both groups (group A, range 2-7; group B, range 2-10). Night evacuation (greater than once per week) occurred in seven patients in each group. All patients in both groups could delay the desire to defaecate by more than 30 min. Eleven patients in group A and 12 in group B had normal continence. Evidence to date favours a full mucosectomy. Function is not vitiated by this technique and surgical removal of the disease is more complete. \nEffect of mild hyperthermia on the ischemic infarct volume after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. We investigated the effect of mild whole-body hyperthermia (40 degrees C) on a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model in Fisher rats by subjecting them to MCAo under the following conditions: (1) normothermia (n = 20); (2) hyperthermia (n = 14) before (1 hour), during, and after (1 hour) MCAo; and (3) post-MCAo hyperthermia (n = 14) for 1 hour. We measured brain and body temperatures during the experiment using micro-thermocouples and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability using Evans blue staining of the brain. We measured the volume of the infarcted brain tissue 4 days after MCAo. We detected no differences in BBB permeability among three groups. The volume of infarcted tissue was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) for the two groups of hyperthermic animals than the normothermic animals. Our data suggest that mild hyperthermia, both during and after induction of ischemia, has a detrimental effect on the ischemic infarct volume in this model. \nInner ear deafness in Wegener's granulomatosis. Autoimmune deafness represents a heterogeneous group of disorders in which there is though to be inner ear and/or middle ear damage mediated by various immunological abnormalities. We describe a patient with Wegener's granulomatosis in whom there was evidence of significant inner ear damage caused by vasculitis, which was completely reversed by cyclophosphamide and prednisolone. We propose that Wegener's granulomatosis is a cause of autoimmune deafness. \nEpidemiology of nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteremia during the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic. To assess the impact of the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic on nontyphoidal Salmonella septicemia and to identify risk factors for this infection, national laboratory-based Salmonella surveillance data and AIDS case reports were analyzed. Among 25- to 49-year-old men in states with a high incidence of AIDS, the proportion of Salmonella isolates reported from blood increased from 2.8% in 1978-1982 to 14.2% in 1983-1987, with substantial increases for serotypes enteritidis and typhimurium. Of adolescents and adults reported with AIDS from September 1987 through March 1990, 337 (0.48%) had recurrent Salmonella septicemia, with higher proportions among those who resided in the Northeast (0.86%), had a history of intravenous drug use (0.79%), or were black (0.74%) or Hispanic (0.57%). These data suggest that the risk of Salmonella septicemia in persons with AIDS is affected by geographic prevalence of Salmonella species, host characteristics, and invasiveness of infecting strains. \nUsefulness of a writing device in writer's cramp. Fifteen of 20 patients with writer's cramp treated with a writing device noted an improvement in their writing ability, some quite marked. Despite this benefit, nine patients preferred to use alternate methods. In the absence of adverse effects, we suggest that trials of writing devices be the first recourse for all patients with writer's cramp requiring treatment. \nRenal transplant arterial thrombosis: association with cyclosporine. Of 136 patients who received a renal transplant between January 1984 and August 1988, there were six cases (4.4%) of allograft arterial thrombosis (AAT) occurring a mean of 23 days after transplantation. All were maintained on cyclosporine A(CsA) in addition to prednisone and azathioprine. All transplants were performed by the same transplant surgeon. Five of the six episodes (83%) were in allografts that had multiple renal arteries (MRA), giving an incidence of AAT in that group of 36%. Only one of 122 (0.8%) allografts with a single renal artery experienced thrombosis. CsA was started a mean of 9 days after transplantation (range, 16 to 33 days). There was no correlation of AAT to CsA levels. AAT appears to be an early complication of allografts with MRA in patients maintained on CsA. \nThe effect of intravenous flumazenil on interictal electroencephalographic epileptic activity: results of a placebo-controlled study. The effect on interictal electroencephalographic epileptic activity of intravenous flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), a benzodiazepine antagonist and potential antiepileptic drug, was studied in 10 patients. Comparison was made with intravenous diazepam (10 mg) and placebo using a single-blind, single-dose, cross-over design. A dose of 3 mg flumazenil was well tolerated and produced a significantly greater reduction in the number of epileptic transients during the first 40 minutes after injection than did placebo (p less than 0.05). This effect was similar to that of diazepam in magnitude and duration. When flumazenil (3 mg) was administered immediately after intravenous diazepam (10 mg), the reduction in interictal epileptic activity was not significantly different from that produced by diazepam alone. The results suggest that either flumazenil has intrinsic antiepileptic activity and in this respect acts as a partial agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, or that it is antagonising an endogenous proconvulsant ligand in these patients. \nEfficacy and safety of intravenous and oral propafenone in pediatric cardiac dysrhythmias. Propafenone was administered to 58 patients with a mean age of 3.2 years (range 0.1 to 16). Mean intravenous dose was 1.2 mg/kg body weight (range 0.3 to 1.5 mg). The final mean oral maintenance dose was 308 mg/m2 body surface area (range 200 to 600 mg/m2, 16.8 mg/kg body weight). After intravenous application, propafenone was effective in 21 of 36 patients; atrial flutter was converted in 1 of 5 patients, and reentry supraventricular tachycardia was controlled in 15 of 25 patients. Propafenone was partially or completely effective in 3 of 4 patients with chaotic atrial tachycardia. Junctional ectopic tachycardia was suppressed in 2 infants. Thirty-seven patients had oral treatment with a mean follow-up of 2.2 years. Propafenone was effective in 33 of 37 patients (89%); atrial flutter was controlled in 2 patients, ventricular ectopy was suppressed in 1 of 2 patients. In reentry supraventricular tachycardia, propafenone was effective in 25 of 28 patients. Chaotic atrial tachycardia (n = 3) and junctional ectopic tachycardia (n = 2) were controlled after successful intravenous therapy. Systemic side effects were rare. Two patients developed a proarrhythmic effect, and 1 patient with ventricular ectopy after repair of tetralogy of Fallot died suddenly during propafenone maintenance therapy. \nSquamous cell carcinoma of the umbilicus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A variety of malignancies, including hematologic malignancies, Kaposi's sarcoma, as well as adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinoma have been reported in association with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Tumors of the umbilical area are unusual and can represent lesions of urachal origin. These may require extensive resection and are associated with a poor prognosis. We describe here a case of a young woman with AIDS who developed a squamous cell carcinoma of the umbilicus which suggests more than a casual relationship between these two conditions. \nOutcome of extensive coronary artery dissection during coronary angioplasty. A total of 32 (3.6%) patients of 880 undergoing coronary angioplasty during a nine year period at one hospital had extensive dissection (defined as a dissection extending beyond the limits of the dilated angioplasty balloon) in the coronary artery in which the angioplasty procedure was performed. Two (6.25%) of the 32 patients (both of whom were undergoing angioplasty because of unstable angina that was refractory to medical treatment) died as a consequence of the coronary artery dissection. Twelve (38%) needed immediate coronary artery bypass surgery and 11 (34%) had a myocardial infarction, which in four was minor in extent. During follow up, 20 of the 32 patients were successfully managed by medical treatment; only two needed further angioplasty procedures. There were no late deaths. Extensive coronary artery dissection is a serious complication of coronary angioplasty, with a high early mortality and a high incidence of infarction and requirement for bypass surgery. None the less, patients with extensive dissection who are free from the manifestations of acute ischaemia at the end of the procedure can be managed conservatively and have a good immediate and medium term outlook. Attempts should be made to stabilise extensive dissection during coronary angioplasty so that surgical intervention can be delayed or avoided altogether if possible. \nEarly gold weight eyelid implantation for facial paralysis. Facial paralysis can result in serious keratopathy because of corneal exposure and inadequate lacrimation. Thirty-seven patients underwent thirty-eight gold weight upper lid implants to rehabilitate paralysis of the eyelid from various causes. When indicated, implantation was combined with lower lid ectropion repair, medial canthoplasty or brow lift. Because of encouraging results in patients with longstanding facial paralysis, \"early\" implantation (within 1 month of paralysis) was offered to patients with severe lagophthalmos in whom (1) a severe neural injury was documented at the time of transtemporal surgery or (2) delayed, incomplete return of function was expected. Gold weight implantation resulted in excellent eyelid closure, protection, and cosmesis. There were no infections or extrusions. Lagophthalmos and exposure keratitis resolved or were significantly improved in all patients, and most were able to dispense with eyedrops and salves. Visual acuity improved in 95% of patients--a benefit even those without preoperative keratitis often achieved. A mild worsening of one patient's pre-existing astigmatism developed, which resolved after reimplantation with a lighter weight. The implant is easily removed from those patients who, having undergone early implantation, eventually recover adequate function. Gold weight loading has become our procedure of choice for eyelid rehabilitation. \nLow-dose aspirin therapy for chronic stable angina. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, trial. PATIENTS: The study included 333 men with baseline chronic stable angina but with no previous history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack who were enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study, a trial of aspirin among 22,071 male physicians. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive alternate-day aspirin therapy (325 mg) or placebo and were followed for an average of 60.2 months for the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: During follow-up, 27 patients had confirmed myocardial infarctions; 7 were among the 178 patients with chronic stable angina who received aspirin therapy and 20 were among the 155 patients who received placebo (relative risk, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.63; P = 0.003). While simultaneously controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors in a proportional hazards model, an overall 87% risk reduction was calculated (relative risk, 0.13; CI, 0.04 to 0.42; P less than 0.001). For the subgroup of patients with chronic stable angina but no previous coronary bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty, an almost identical reduction in the risk for myocardial infarction was found (relative risk, 0.14; CI, 0.04 to 0.56; P = 0.006). Of 13 strokes, 11 occurred in the aspirin group and 2 in the placebo group (relative risk, 5.4; CI, 1.3 to 22.1; P = 0.02). No stroke was fatal, but 4 produced some long-term impairment of function. One stroke, in the aspirin group, was hemorrhagic. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that alternate-day aspirin therapy greatly reduced the risk for first myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina, a group of patients at high risk for cardiovascular death (P less than 0.001). Although our results for stroke were based on small numbers, they suggested an apparent increase in frequency of stroke with aspirin therapy; this finding requires confirmation in randomized trials of adequate sample size. \nHemodynamic determinants of exercise capacity in chronic heart failure. PURPOSE: To synthesize information on hemodynamic determinants of exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Relevant studies published from the mid-1960s to the present were identified by a manual search of the English-language literature and by bibliographic review of pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION: Both controlled and observational studies that reported measures of either exercise time or oxygen uptake and hemodynamic variables in patients with heart failure were reviewed for quality and included when relevant to the discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: Key conclusions or data, or both, were extracted from each article and described. DATA SYNTHESIS: Exercise intolerance is a hallmark of chronic congestive heart failure. Studies have emphasized central factors and indices of systolic ventricular function, but poor relations have been consistently found between these measurements and exercise capacity. Recent data suggest that diastolic function (that is, ventricular filling and compliance) is an important factor affecting the ability to increase cardiac output and determining exercise capacity, but this issue needs further study. A clearer picture of histologic and biochemical abnormalities in skeletal muscle has recently emerged; patients with heart failure show greater glycolysis, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and reduced oxidative enzyme activity. Vasodilatory abnormalities in heart failure were first described more than 20 years ago, and such abnormalities may underlie recently reported reductions in skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise. Relative hyperventilation is commonly observed during exercise in patients with heart failure and is related to ventilation-perfusion mismatching in the lung due to a higher-than-normal fraction of physiologic dead space. Neurohumoral abnormalities include reductions in beta-receptor density and sensitivity and contribute to reduced inotropic and chronotropic responses to exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Systolic function and exercise capacity are unrelated in patients with chronic heart failure, but many hemodynamic abnormalities (including those in the heart, lung, and skeletal muscle) overlap, which leads to exercise intolerance in these patients. \nMassive ST-segment elevation without myocardial injury in a patient with fulminant hepatic failure and cerebral edema. A 49-year-old woman presented in fulminant hepatic failure. The ECG showed dramatic ST-segment elevation, suggesting diffuse myocardial injury. However, echocardiography, creatine phosphokinase enzyme determinations, and examination of the heart at autopsy (six days later) failed to demonstrate any physiologic, anatomic, or histologic evidence of abnormality. The appearance of ST-segment elevation in this setting should not prompt treatment for cardiac disease or limit the candidacy for liver transplantation of such critically ill patients. \nOral Kaposi's sarcoma in a woman as a first indication of HIV infection. Although Kaposi's sarcoma has been well described in homosexual men at risk for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, there have been fewer reports of KS in women, and most of these have been in women who became infected with HIV through intravenous drug use. This report describes a woman who had no history of intravenous drug use in whom intraoral KS and hairy leukoplakia were the first indication of her infection with HIV. \nTumor cytokinetic response to total parenteral nutrition in patients with head and neck cancers. Refeeding of patients with malignant tumors may induce tumor-cell DNA synthesis. The present study was aimed at evaluating whether induction of altered cell-cycle kinetics could be induced by intravenous total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in tumor biopsies from head and neck cancers. Nine malnourished patients with squamous cell carcinoma in the head-and-neck area were investigated before and after 5-7 d of continuous TPN. Tumor biopsies were taken in both fasted and fed states for determination of 1) ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, which is rate limiting for polyamine synthesis; 2) flow-cytometric-DNA-distribution measurements; and 3) the fraction of proliferating cells expressed as immunohistochemical reactivity with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. The histopathological differentiation, the fraction of aneuploidic cells, ODC activity, and Ki-67 reactivity were not significantly related to each other, although the number of aneuploidic cells in replicative phases correlated with the number of cells expressing the Ki-67 antigen (r = 0.86, P less than 0.01). Tumor cytokinetics showed no evidence of being changed by TPN administration. \nMolecular biology of hypertension. Hypertension results from abnormalities of the control systems that normally regulate blood pressure. These control systems include vascular, cardiogenic, renal, neurogenic, and endocrine mechanisms that interact in a complex but integrated manner to achieve blood pressure homeostasis. Multiple endogenous biologically active substances participate in the regulation of these control systems. Evidence suggests that abnormalities of these regulatory mechanisms resulting from altered genetic and environmental interactions play an important role in the pathogenesis of primary hypertension. Once hypertension develops, it tends to be self-perpetuating via amplifying mechanisms mediated by secondary structural changes in the blood vessels, heart, and kidney. These adaptative structural changes amplify and perpetuate hypertension by increasing systemic vascular resistance, enhancing cardiac output, and impairing renal sodium and water excretion. The long-term sequelae of hypertensive structural changes in these end organs are complications of atherosclerotic vascular disease, cardiac hypertrophy and failure, stroke, and renal failure. With the tools of molecular biology, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities has increased enormously and continues to grow at a rapid pace, as illustrated by the discussion that follows. Our review of the molecular biology of hypertension will address systematically four key areas: 1) molecular biology of the control systems, 2) molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular structural changes, 3) genetics of hypertension, and 4) application of transgenic technology in studies of hypertension. \nHepatic focal nodular hyperplasia: specific findings at dynamic contrast-enhanced US with carbon dioxide microbubbles. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) with intraarterial infusion of carbon dioxide microbubbles was performed for four cases of histologically proved focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in four patients and for 167 cases of various hepatic nodules in 144 patients. No complications due to dynamic US were observed in any of the 148 patients. All FNH nodules were less than 3 cm in diameter. Consistent specific findings of FNH were not obtained with US, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radiocolloid scanning, or angiography in the four cases of FNH. In contrast, the characteristic vascular pattern (ie, early central hypervascular supply with centrifugal filling to the periphery at the arterial phase and a uniform or lobulated dense stain at the capillary phase) was observed in all four cases of FNH with dynamic US. This vascular pattern demonstrated in FNH with dynamic US was not seen in any of the 167 hepatic nodules, including 44 small hepatocellular carcinomas less than 3 cm in diameter. Therefore, the newly developed, dynamic contrast-enhanced US technique seems to be extremely sensitive and specific for diagnosing FNH and is useful in the differentiation of FNH from other hepatic tumors, especially hepatocellular carcinoma. \nGlobal T wave inversion. Because global T wave inversion has not been specifically characterized, 100 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with this pattern (frontal plane T vector -100 degrees to -170 degrees with precordial T inversion) were prospectively collected from approximately 30,000 consecutively interpreted ECGs and analyzed blindly. There was a striking female predominance (82 women vs. 18 men; p less than 0.0005) despite an essentially equal number of female and male hospital admissions. There was a single statistically significant ECG correlate: a more vertical QRS axis in women (+14.1 degrees +/- 45.3 degrees vs. -5.6 degrees +/- 31.3 degrees; p = 0.034). The T waves were basically symmetric (68%), the influence of this factor usually altering the characteristically asymmetric T wave inversions of right bundle branch block (4 of 5) and left ventricular hypertrophy (21 of 36). Asymmetry was mainly associated with digoxin therapy (21 of 32 patients taking digoxin; p less than or equal to 0.0005) and a corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.433 +/- 0.095) shorter than with symmetric T wave inversions (0.507 +/- 0.074; p less than or equal to 0.0005) though not reaching the degree of shortening expected for digitalization. Twenty-eight patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and 23 for a central nervous system disorder accounted for the majority of patients with symmetric T wave inversion. Fifteen of 18 patients who had coronary angiography had some degree of coronary artery disease: 3 had angiographically normal coronary arteries. \nTwenty-four-hour activity of felodipine extended release in chronic stable angina pectoris. To investigate the antiischemic efficacy and duration of action of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine, 15 patients with stable exertional angina were enrolled in a double-blind, crossover study comparing 2 doses (5 and 10 mg) of felodipine extended release (ER) and placebo given once daily for 1 week. Bicycle exercise tests were repeated at the end of each treatment period 4 and 24 hours after dosing. Four hours after dosing with both felodipine doses, only 5 patients discontinued the exercise test because of greater than 2 mm of ST-segment depression, whereas 10 continued until exhaustion (p less than 0.01 vs placebo). Compared with placebo, total exercise time was increased by 19% (p less than 0.001), with no difference between doses. After 24 hours, exercise duration was prolonged up to physical exhaustion in 6 patients taking felodipine 10 mg (p less than 0.05 vs both placebo and felodipine 5 mg); moreover, 11 patients taking 10 mg and 5 taking 5 mg increased time to 1 mm of ST depression greater than or equal to 15% compared with exercise time during the placebo test. Mean time to 1 mm of ST depression at 24 hours was increased by 8% with 5 mg and by 18% with 10 mg (p less than 0.001 vs placebo; p less than 0.01 between doses). Total exercise time at 24 hours was increased with both doses (p less than 0.001), with greater efficacy with the 10-mg dose (p less than 0.05 vs 5 mg). \nComparison of patient-controlled analgesia and epidural morphine for postcesarean pain and recovery. A greater awareness of the advantages and limitations of new methods of administering postcesarean analgesia would help the obstetrician care for the recovering patient. Patient-controlled analgesia and epidural morphine are two new modalities for postoperative pain relief. The purpose of this prospective investigation was to compare their effectiveness, safety, side effects, patient satisfaction and cost. During an eight-month period, 161 women undergoing cesarean delivery were assigned to receive narcotics by either epidural morphine (76 patients) or patient-controlled analgesia (85 patients) using a combined continuous infusion and demand dosing of meperidine. The demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. Mild or no pain was reported with similar frequencies in both groups. No reduced respiration or undesired sedation was seen in either group. The postoperative times before sitting at the bedside, ambulating, tolerating clear liquids and leaving the hospital were also comparable. No complications were encountered with patient-controlled analgesia, but pruritus and alarms from apnea monitors occurred commonly in the epidural morphine group. The costs to the patient were similar for the two groups. Patient-controlled analgesia using a combined continuous infusion and demand dosing is an acceptable alternative to epidural morphine after cesarean delivery. \nPrevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting using ondansetron, a new, selective, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The effect of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 84 patients undergoing gynecologic operation and receiving the same general anesthetic. The patients received premedication with either 16 mg oral ondansetron, or a matching placebo. The same medication was given postoperatively 8 h after the first dose. During the first hour after recovery from anesthesia, the frequencies of nausea and vomiting were 52% and 40%, respectively, in patients given placebos. In the ondansetron group nausea and vomiting developed in 17% and 12%, respectively, values significantly different from those with placebos (P less than 0.005). Similar differences were observed throughout the entire 24-h period after recovery, the incidence of nausea and vomiting being 67% and 60%, respectively, in the placebo group and 29% and 26% in the ondansetron treatment group. Ondansetron appears to be a promising antiemetic for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. \nDetection of intraoperative laser injury to the facial nerve by electromyographic monitoring of facial muscles. Injury to the facial nerve is a significant risk during resection of cerebellopontine angle tumors. To minimize the risk of facial nerve injury, intraoperative electromyographic monitoring of facial musculature is frequently used. However, the reliability of such monitoring systems for detection of thermal nerve injury resulting from the use of carbon dioxide lasers has not been systematically evaluated. We determined the sensitivity of a computerized electromyographic monitor for detection of laser facial nerve injury in an anesthetized rat model. The mandibular and buccal branches of the facial nerve were isolated in 12 rats. A carbon dioxide laser was used to create controlled sites of thermal injury to both nerves over a 3-hour period. When a laser injury was created distal to previous injury sites, electromyographic discharge was noted in 72% to 82% of injuries. Laser injury proximal to previous injury sites was detected with 33% efficiency. These detection rates did not change significantly over a 3-hour period. This preliminary data suggests that electromyographic monitoring of facial musculature allows detection of facial nerve injury caused by carbon dioxide lasers. \nBacteriology of the appendix and the ileum in health and in appendicitis. The bacteriology of the ileum and the appendix in appendicitis patients with or without perforation and compared with patients who had \"incidental appendectomy\" was studied. Of 42 appendicitis patients, 24 (57%) of them had anaerobic bacteria in the appendix compared with two of eight (25%) with normal appendix. Anaerobes were found in the ileal aspirates of 20 of 42 (47.6%) appendicitis patients and two of eight (25%) in normal persons. This suggests that anaerobic bacteria increasingly colonize the appendix and the ileum in cases of appendicitis. \nPossible mechanism of vascular reocclusion after initially successful thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. We studied the effects of urokinase (UK), pro-urokinase (pro-UK), and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on platelet aggregation and the production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) in vitro. Both UK and pro-UK inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), collagen, or thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, although a low dose of rt-PA (5 to 10 x 10(4) U/ml) blunted platelet aggregability, a high dose (40 to 60 x 10(4) U/ml) led to platelet hyperaggregation. UK and pro-UK markedly inhibited TXA2 synthesis during ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Despite the significant reduction of TXA2 synthesis by 10 x 10(4) U/ml rt-PA, a concentration of 60 x 10(4) U/ml rt-PA had no effect on synthesis. These results indicate that UK and pro-UK each inhibit platelet function, but a high concentration of rt-PA enhances platelet aggregability. This finding may at least in part contribute to the high incidence of reocclusion after initially successful thrombolysis with rt-PA. \nTreatment of bone, joint, and vascular-access-associated gram-positive bacterial infections with teicoplanin. Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in the treatment of vascular-access-associated bacteremias and of bone and joint infections due to susceptible gram-positive organisms. Of 35 patients enrolled, 26 had osteomyelitis, 8 had vascular-access-associated bacteremias, and 1 had a joint infection. A total of 38 gram-positive isolates were identified: 23 Staphylococcus aureus and 6 coagulase-negative staphylococcus and 9 streptococcus isolates. After at least 6 months of follow-up, 17 patients were evaluable for efficacy: 10 of 14 (71%) with osteomyelitis and 3 of 3 with vascular-access-associated bacteremias had full resolution of their infections. Inadequate debridement, the presence of metal, and inadequate dosing were likely causes of two failures and two relapses in patients with osteomyelitis. For all but two organisms, teicoplanin MICs were less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Patients who responded had median peak and trough serum bactericidal levels at serum dilutions of 1:64 and 1:16; trough levels of teicoplanin in serum were greater than 30 micrograms/ml. Patients did not respond as expected to daily doses of 4 mg/kg of body weight, which consequently were increased to greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg. Audiology testing of 20 patients found 2 with a mild loss of high-frequency hearing; 1 patient complained of tinnitus. Patients tolerated peak levels in serum as high as 127 micrograms/ml and trough levels of 49 micrograms/ml. However, 5 of 18 patients (28%) whose daily dose was greater than or equal to 12 mg/kg developed drug fever and rash and had teicoplanin discontinued. Further study of the antibiotic at such higher doses is needed. \nThe clinical spectrum of hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases. Malignancy-related hypocalcaemia has received less attention in the literature than the opposite perturbation, hypercalcaemia. Only, scarce and contradictory data exist about hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases (BMH). We have reviewed the clinical records of 155 patients with bone metastases of solid tumours, 122 of which were followed during the whole course of the disease until death. The frequency of hypocalcaemia ranged from 5 to 13%, depending on the formula used to correct calcium values for protein concentration. BMH was almost exclusively limited to patients with osteoblastic metastases. The frequency of BMH among patients with prostate carcinoma was 13-27%, depending on the formula used. Only two of 60 patients with lytic bone lesions presented hypocalcaemia, and in both cases it was rather mild. The development of hypocalcaemia did not seem to imply a worse prognosis, at least in patients with carcinoma of the prostate. Thus, the prevalence of BMH appears to be higher than is usually considered. Adequate attention should be given to this disorder because of the potentially deleterious effects on several organ systems. \nUpdate on esophageal radiology. This article reviews the current status of double-contrast radiography in diagnosing pharyngeal tumors and opportunistic esophagitis and the radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility disorders in patients with chest pain. Double-contrast pharyngography is a valuable technique for detecting pharyngeal tumors. These lesions may be manifested by an intraluminal mass, mucosal irregularity, or asymmetric distensibility. Furthermore, barium studies may demonstrate lesions involving the valleculae, tongue base, lower hypopharynx, and pharyngoesophageal segment that are difficult to visualize at endoscopy. Double-contrast radiography is also a valuable technique for detecting opportunistic esophagitis and for differentiating the underlying causes. Mucosal plaques should suggest Candida esophagitis, whereas discrete ulcers should suggest herpes esophagitis, and one or more large, relatively flat ulcers should suggest cytomegalovirus esophagitis. Finally, in evaluating patients with chest pain, in only a small percentage are esophageal motility disorders found to be a possible cause of their pain. Instead, the majority are found to have cardiac disease, structural esophageal lesions, or gastroesophageal reflux, so that barium studies are more useful in documenting normal motility or structural abnormalities in these patients. \nDiagnosis of segmental necrosis in a pancreas transplant by thallium-201 perfusion scintigraphy. Thallium-201 was used to image a patient with a pancreatic transplant. Incomplete visualization of the graft on the 201Tl scan, compared to CT, led to the diagnosis of segmental necrosis of the tail of the graft. Due to the low background and favorable target-to-non-target ratio, 201Tl pancreas scintigraphy may be useful in the follow-up of pancreatic transplants. \nMagnetic resonance imaging of intractable complex partial seizures: pathologic and electroencephalographic correlation. Prior studies indicate variable usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of patients with complex partial seizures (CPS), but sensitivities as low as 12% have been reported. We analyzed the MRI examinations of 20 patients with medically refractory CPS who later underwent resection of the seizure focus proven by electroencephalography (EEG). MRI studies were correlated with surgical pathology in all patients. Eleven of the 20 CPS patients had mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Seven of the 11 (64%) exhibited an MRI abnormality at the site of the EEG-demonstrated histopathologic focus. MRI abnormalities included temporal lobe hypoplasia or atrophy (four patients), and increased signal intensity on long repetition time (TR) sequences (three patients). Four patients had no MRI abnormalities corresponding to the histopathologic focus. Nine of the 20 CPS patients had other abnormalities responsible for the seizures, including astrocytoma, cryptic vascular malformation, hamartoma, polymicrogyria, tuberous sclerosis (forme fruste), arachnoid cyst, and congenital hemiatrophy. No patient had normal MRI studies. Our single most useful MRI sequence was the coronal long TR/dual echo sequence, using cardiac gating and first-order gradient moment nulling to diminish flow-related artifacts that could hinder evaluation of medial temporal lobe structures. \nElectromyographic activity of selected leg musculature in subjects with normal and chronically sprained ankles performing on a BAPS board. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the magnitude and temporal features of tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and gastrocnemius muscle activity during exercises performed on a Biomechanical Ankle Platform System (BAPS) board by subjects with normal and chronically sprained ankles. Fourteen participants in each of the two groups rotated the platform in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions at self-selected velocities. Trials were completed with both medium- and large-sized hemispheres under the platform while electromyographic surface recordings were made from the three muscles of interest. Electromyographic values, normalized within individuals as a percentage of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), ranged from 20% to 80% of MVIC. An analysis of variance for the average myoelectric signals from all three muscles revealed no differences between the two groups. Effects of direction and hemisphere size were shown for all muscles. The large hemisphere produced significantly greater average activity and a more pronounced effect on the tibialis anterior muscle. The data provide information on the level of muscle activity required for conditions used in this study and may assist the physical therapist with making judgments about the use of this device in rehabilitation programs. \nPancreatic-portal vein fistula with disseminated fat necrosis treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy. I have reported the case of a 62-year-old man with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and a rare pseudocyst-portal vein fistula. Even though he experienced no abdominal symptoms, he had severe metastatic fat necrosis manifested as subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, medullary bone necrosis, and mental status changes. Remote tissue destruction continued until relief was gained by pancreaticoduodenectomy and repair of the necrotic portal vein. Disseminated fat necrosis is a rare syndrome that can be the only presenting feature in patients with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Early recognition and treatment of the underlying pancreatic disease may decrease the high morality rate associated with this syndrome. \nHistopathological studies of a new liquid embolization method using estrogen-alcohol and polyvinyl acetate. Experimental evaluations with a model of cortical arterial cannulation in the canine brain. This experimental report evaluates the histopathological effects of a new embolization method using estrogen-alcohol (E-A) and polyvinyl acetate solution (PVac) as tested on 21 mongrel dogs. Three other animals treated with normal saline served as controls. All agents were introduced through an isolated cortical artery. Estrogen-alcohol induced immediate occlusion of small vessels (less than 20 microns), and then progressive obstruction of larger ones (200-300 microns) within several days. Animals treated with PVac showed vascular obliteration (greater than 100 microns) and moderate chronic fibrosis. The effects of embolization using E-A followed by PVac were found to have the combined advantages of both materials, showing diffuse occlusion of the vascular network with less tissue reaction. Hyalinization of embolized vessels with extensive fibrosis occurred afterward. For 6 weeks there was no evidence of recanalization or foreign body giant cell reaction. This study shows that E-A and PVac are capable of producing vascular occlusions with only mild tissue reaction. Because they are easily controllable and have no adverse effects, they may be suitable for intravascular application in the central nervous system. \nACE inhibitors in the elderly. As the population with hypertension becomes older, it is important to determine the properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the elderly. The pharmacokinetics and efficacy of captopril, enalapril, and a new once-daily ACE inhibitor, quinapril for the treatment of hypertension in young and elderly patients are reviewed, and the safety profiles of these agents in young and elderly patients are discussed. Although the safely profile of all three drugs is very favorable, quinapril tended to be better tolerated by patients of all ages in comparative clinical trials. \nUltrasonic decalcification of the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement. Aortic valve replacement for calcifica aortic stenosis requires meticulous debridement of the aortic annulus to effect optimal valve seating. Since 1987, we have used ultrasonic energy to debride the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement in 56 patients. In our experience, ultrasonic debridement of the annulus is superior to traditional methods of debridement, affords improved seating of the valve, and may allow placement of a larger valve. Our follow-up ranges from 2 to 32 months (mean follow-up, 13 +/- 9 months) with 0% incidence of paravalvular leak or valve failure. We advocate the use of ultrasonic debridement as an adjunctive tool in aortic valve replacement. \nFundus photographic risk factors for progression of diabetic retinopathy. ETDRS report number 12. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group. In the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, a randomized clinical trial sponsored by the National Eye Institute, one eye of each patient was assigned to early photocoagulation and the other to deferral of photocoagulation (i.e., careful follow-up and initiation of photocoagulation only if high-risk proliferative retinopathy developed). This design allowed observation of the natural course of diabetic retinopathy in the initially untreated eye. Gradings of baseline stereoscopic fundus photographs of eyes with nonproliferative retinopathy assigned to deferral of photocoagulation were used to examine the power of various abnormalities and combinations of abnormalities to predict progression to proliferative retinopathy in photographs taken at the 1-, 3-, and 5-year follow-up visits.
