        "text": "e functions were studied in 6 patients with clinically diagnosed progressive supranuclear palsy who conformed to the characteristic pattern of 'subcortical dementia'. Dysarthria, reading difficulties and disturbances of handwriting were present in all patients. Some patients showed additional deficits including visual dyslexia, constructional dysgraphia and an increased rate of self-corrections and misnamings in object confrontation naming. In most instances, the naming errors referred to an object visually similar to the target object, suggesting that visual misperception is the major cause of the naming disorder. It is concluded that a variety of language impairments may develop secondary to other neurological and neuropsychological changes in progressive supranuclear palsy. \nPeriodic and chaotic host-parasite interactions in human malaria. It has been recognized since ancient times that malaria fever is highly periodic but the mechanism has been poorly understood. Malaria fever is related to the parasite growth cycle in erythrocytes. After a fixed period of replication, a mature parasite (schizont) causes the infected erythrocyte to rupture, releasing progeny that quickly invade other erythrocytes. Simultaneous rupture of a large number of schizonts stimulates a host fever response. Febrile temperatures are damaging to Plasmodium falciparum, particularly in the second half of its 48-hr replicative cycle. Using a mathematical model, we show that these interactions naturally tend to generate periodic fever. The model predicts chaotic parasite population dynamics at high multiplication rates, consistent with the classical observation that P. falciparum causes less regular fever than other species of parasite. \nEffect of hypotensive epidural anaesthesia on acetabular cement-bone fixation in total hip arthroplasty. We selected 20 matched pairs of patients who had had total hip arthroplasty by the same surgeon using the same cemented technique. Matching was by age, sex, height, weight and diagnosis. One of each pair had received hypotensive epidural anaesthesia, with less than 300 ml blood loss: the other had normotensive general anaesthesia with more than 500 ml of blood loss. Early postoperative radiographs were evaluated independently by three blinded observers, using a scoring criteria which assessed the quality of the cement-bone interface. The results showed that patients who had received epidural anaesthesia had significantly better radiographic scores (p less than 0.02). Our findings suggest that hypotensive anaesthesia facilitates penetration of cement into bone. \nEchocardiographic estimation of critical left ventricular size in infants with isolated aortic valve stenosis. With the current trend to performing surgical valvotomy for infantile aortic stenosis without cardiac catheterization, there is a need to develop echocardiographic criteria for adequacy of left ventricular size. The echocardiograms and catheterization data of all 25 infants less than 3 months of age undergoing aortic valvotomy for isolated aortic valve stenosis from September 1980 through July 1990 were reviewed. Significant differences (p less than 0.05) between the survivors and nonsurvivors were noted for age at operation (30 +/- 28 vs. 3 +/- 1.5 days), mitral valve diameter (10.1 +/- 1.7 vs. 7.7 +/- 1.5 mm), left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (18.4 +/- 6.4 vs. 11.4 +/- 3 mm), left atrial dimensions (15.3 +/- 3.8 vs. 10 +/- 2.4 mm), left ventricular cross-sectional area on the parasternal long-axis echocardiogram (4 +/- 1.9 vs. 2 +/- 1.9 cm2) and angiographically determined left ventricular end-diastolic volume (43 +/- 23 vs. 11 +/- 5 ml/m2). There was no difference with respect to patient weight, body surface area, aortic root dimension or left ventricular ejection fraction. Left ventricular cross-sectional area less than 2 cm2 as measured on the parasternal long-axis echocardiogram was found in 5 of 7 nonsurvivors and 0 of 12 survivors, making this a risk factor for perioperative death (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension less than 13 mm was found in 5 of 6 nonsurvivors and 2 of 17 survivors, making this another risk factor for early mortality (p less than 0.05). \nCompartment syndrome of the thigh with osteogenesis imperfecta. A case report. Compartment syndrome of the thigh has been sporadically reported in the orthopedic literature. A 27-year-old man with osteogenesis imperfecta sustained a femoral fracture with relatively minor trauma and subsequently developed compartment syndrome of the thigh. Fat embolism syndrome and hyperplastic callus developed postoperatively. \nAcute effects of intravenous nicardipine on hemodynamics and cardiac function in patients with a healed myocardial infarction and no evidence of congestive heart failure. Acute effects of intravenous nicardipine (10 micrograms/kg) on systemic hemodynamics and cardiac function were evaluated in 17 patients with a healed myocardial infarction and no evidence of congestive heart failure. Mean New York Heart Association functional class was 1.6 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- standard deviation). Aortic systolic pressure (p less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased (10 +/- 3 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly (p less than 0.001), whereas pulmonary and right atrial pressure and pulmonary arteriolar resistance did not change. Cardiac and stroke indexes showed biphasic changes. Although positive and negative maximal rate of left ventricular pressures decreased significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively), they did not change significantly when aortic systolic pressure was corrected. There was a significant inverse correlation between the negative rate of left ventricular pressure/aortic systolic pressure before nicardipine infusion and its maximal percent increase after infusion (r = -0.56, p less than 0.05), indicating a beneficial effect on diastolic relaxation in patients with impaired diastolic function. Our data show that a low dose (10 micrograms/kg) of intravenous nicardipine exerts a favorable effect on impaired diastolic function, but depresses left ventricular pump function with much less effect on right heart circulation. \nBioelectric impedance analysis: experience with male patients with cirrhosis. Bioelectric impedance analysis is a new, convenient and portable method used to estimate total body water and to assess body composition in healthy people. We used the tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis method in 58 cirrhotic patients to assess its clinical applicability. Whole-body resistance, reactance and impedance were measured and compared with those of 30 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex. The resistance and impedance values of ascitic cirrhotic patients (resistance = 461 +/- 80 omega; impedance = 462 +/- 80 omega) and nonascitic cirrhotic patients (resistance = 487 +/- 96 omega; impedance = 489 +/- 97 omega) were comparable with the resistance (488 +/- 44 omega) and impedance (491 +/- 44 omega) of controls. However, a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in whole body reactance was found in patients with ascites and in those without ascites (34 +/- 9 omega vs. 47 +/- 12 omega) as compared with healthy subjects (56 +/- 7 omega). In 10 ascitic patients total body water was determined both before and after paracentesis; the volume of intraperitoneal fluid removed (7.9 +/- 3.8 L) could not be fully accounted for but only detected as an average volume of 1.9 +/- 1.0 L independently of the initial volume of the ascites. Our data clearly demonstrate that tetrapolar bioelectric impedance analysis is not adequate for measuring variations of \"compartmentalized\" fluid in the abdomen. \nExperimental hepatocellular carcinoma: MR receptor imaging. Relaxation time measurements and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed in three different animal models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After intravenous administration of asialoglycoprotein-directed arabinogalactan-stabilized ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (10 mumol Fe/kg receptor agent), T2 of normal liver decreased from 41.6 msec +/- 1.0 to 19.4 msec +/- 1.7 (P less than .05) in rats. T2 of HCC implanted in normal liver or liver with chronic hepatitis was essentially unchanged. These results were similar to those obtained by administration of a reticuloendothelial cell-directed conventional iron oxide; however, the required dose of receptor agent was lower. MR imaging in a woodchuck model of virally induced HCC confirmed the distribution of the hepatocyte-directed agent to regions of functioning and differentiated hepatocytes but not to malignant tumor tissue. The results suggest that MR receptor imaging may play a role in the differentiation between primary liver tumor and functional liver tissue such as that in normal liver hepatitis or regenerating nodules. \nThe beneficial effects of early dexamethasone administration in infants and children with bacterial meningitis. BACKGROUND. In experimental models of meningitis and in children with meningitis, dexamethasone has been shown to reduce meningeal inflammation and to improve the outcome of disease. METHODS. We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of dexamethasone therapy in 101 infants and children admitted to the National Children's Hospital, San Jose, Costa Rica, who had culture-proved bacterial meningitis or clinical signs of meningitis and findings characteristic of bacterial infection on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone and cefotaxime (n = 52) or cefotaxime plus placebo (n = 49). Dexamethasone (0.15 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given 15 to 20 minutes before the first dose of cefotaxime and was continued every 6 hours thereafter for four days. RESULTS. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles were similar for the patients in the two treatment groups. By 12 hours after the beginning of therapy, the mean opening cerebrospinal pressure and the estimated cerebral perfusion pressure had improved significantly in the dexamethasone-treated children but worsened in the children treated only with cefotaxime (controls). At 12 hours meningeal inflammation and the concentrations of two cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha and platelet-activating factor) in the cerebrospinal fluid had decreased in the dexamethasone-treated children, whereas in the controls the inflammatory response in the cerebrospinal fluid had increased. At 24 hours the clinical condition and mean prognostic score were significantly better among those treated with dexamethasone than among the controls. At follow-up examination after a mean of 15 months, 7 of the surviving 51 dexamethasone-treated children (14 percent) and 18 of 48 surviving controls (38 percent) had one or more neurologic or audiologic sequelae (P = 0.007); the relative risk of sequelae for a child receiving placebo as compared with a child receiving dexamethasone was 3.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 11.5). CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study, in which dexamethasone administration began before the initiation of cefotaxime therapy, provide additional evidence of a beneficial effect of dexamethasone therapy in infants and children with bacterial meningitis. \nEvolution of myocardial ischemia and left ventricular function in patients with angina pectoris without myocardial infarction and total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and collaterals from other coronary arteries. Repeated episodes of myocardial ischemia might lead to progressive impairment of left ventricular (LV) function. This radionuclide study assessed myocardial ischemia and LV function several years after documented coronary occlusion without myocardial infarction. Over 5 years, 24 consecutive patients, who underwent cardiac catheterization for angina pectoris without myocardial infarction, had isolated total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery with well-developed collateral vessels. Five patients were successfully treated by coronary bypass grafting and 3 by coronary angioplasty. Among the 16 medically treated patients, 1 was lost to follow-up and 1 died (extracardiac death). The mean (+/- standard deviation) follow-up (14 patients) was 48 +/- 15 months. At follow-up, 8 patients still had clinical chest pain, 11 received antianginal therapy, 4 patients had no stress ischemia and the other 10 had greater than or equal to 1 sign of stress ischemia. All patients had a normal LV ejection fraction at rest (mean 60 +/- 3%; range 55 to 65%). Collateral circulation preserves LV function at the time of occlusion and, in some cases, prevents the development of myocardial ischemia; in patients with persisting myocardial ischemia after well-collateralized coronary occlusion, LV function is not impaired at long-term follow-up. \nThe prognosis of melanoma patients with metastases to two or more lymph node areas. The prognosis of melanoma patients who present with metastatic involvement of two or more noncontiguous lymph node regions before the detection of extranodal metastases has not been previously reported. We identified 21 patients with metastatic melanoma in at least two nodal basins in a review of 175 patients with melanoma undergoing lymphadenectomy at the National Cancer Institute. The median survival time of these patients was 46 months, with 55%, 27%, and 17% of the patients alive 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively, after the second lymphadenectomy. Because the prognosis of melanoma patients with metastases to two or more regional nodal areas appears equivalent to that of patients with metastatic involvement of only one regional node site, lymphadenectomy of the involved groups should be performed with therapeutically curative intent. \nHereditary sacral agenesis with presacral mass and anorectal stenosis: the Currarino triad. A family with autosomal dominant inheritance of sacral agenesis is described. Ten members were affected; four had associated presacral teratomas and anterior sacral meningoceles, giving rise to serious complications in three, including bacterial meningitis, local recurrence of teratoma and perianal sepsis. Three of those with presacral masses presented initially with anorectal anomalies. Other associated abnormalities included tethering of the cord, hydrocephalus, duplex ureter, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteric reflux, neurogenic bladder, bicornuate uterus, rectovaginal fistula and hereditary spherocytosis. Early diagnosis and surgical excision of a presacral mass is advised to prevent future morbidity and mortality. \nTreatment of leiomyomata uteri with leuprolide acetate depot: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. The Leuprolide Study Group. The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety parameters in women with leiomyomata uteri treated with the GnRH agonist leuprolide acetate depot, 3.75 mg intramuscularly every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study involving 13 investigative centers. Mean uterine volume decreased by 36% at 12 weeks and 45% at 24 weeks of leuprolide therapy. Patients treated with placebo had increased in mean uterine volume of 16% at 12 weeks and 5% at 24 weeks. Seventy-seven percent of leuprolide-treated patients had a more than 25% reduction in uterine volume, compared with 9% of placebo-treated controls. Mean uterine volume returned to pre-treatment size 24 weeks after cessation of leuprolide treatment. The majority of patients had resolution or improvement of their fibroid-related symptoms after 24 weeks of leuprolide treatment. Of 38 leuprolide-treated patients presenting with menorrhagia, 37 (97%) had resolution of this symptom at the time of the final visit. Although 95% of women treated with leuprolide acetate experienced some side effects related to hypoestrogenism, only five patients (8%) terminated treatment prematurely. We conclude that leuprolide acetate depot treatment of leiomyomata uteri is safe and causes significant but temporary reductions in uterine size and fibroid-related symptoms. \nEffect of bile on growth, peritoneal absorption, and blood clearance of Escherichia coli in E coli peritonitis. The effect of intraperitoneal bile on growth, peritoneal absorption, and clearance of Escherichia coli was determined in E coli peritonitis in the rat. In E coli peritonitis, intraperitoneal bacterial counts gradually decreased, whereas they increased (after 2 hours) with subsequent development of bacteremia in E coli plus bile peritonitis. After an intraperitoneal injection of labeled bacteria, blood radioactivity was only initially lower in E coli plus bile peritonitis compared with E coli peritonitis. Clearance from blood was lower in E coli plus bile peritonitis than in E coli peritonitis. Organ localization was similar in E coli peritonitis and E coli plus bile peritonitis with decreased splenic, increased pulmonary, and unchanged hepatic uptakes compared with controls. Impaired peritoneal absorption of bacteria, together with impaired local host defense, is likely to enhance the noxious effect of bile in E coli peritonitis. \nRecombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) in dermatology. This paper gives a short review on the function, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic application of recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) in dermatology. Simultaneously, our own experiences are presented for 57 patients (phase II study) suffering from genital warts (21 patients), psoriatic arthritis (10 patients), psoriasis vulgaris (three patients), malignant melanoma (six patients), bowenoid papulosis (four patients), Behcet's disease (four patients), basal cell carcinoma (six patients), as well as herpes simplex recidivans, epidermodysplasia verruciformis, and mycosis fungoides (one patient each). We conclude that there might be an indication for treatment with rIFN-gamma in genital warts, bowenoid papulosis, Behcet's disease, and microbial infections, such as leprosy and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Even though there are reports of a limited beneficial effect of rIFN-gamma on arthritis and skin lesions in psoriasis, we failed to observe any in 10 patients. The main side effects in our low-dose study (50-100 micrograms/d) were mild fever (78%), fatigue (78%), and myalgia (65%). Laboratory tests revealed an increase in the serum triglyceride level, in particular, in psoriatic patients. \nHereditary sacral agenesis with presacral mass and anorectal stenosis: the Currarino triad. A family with autosomal dominant inheritance of sacral agenesis is described. Ten members were affected; four had associated presacral teratomas and anterior sacral meningoceles, giving rise to serious complications in three, including bacterial meningitis, local recurrence of teratoma and perianal sepsis. Three of those with presacral masses presented initially with anorectal anomalies. Other associated abnormalities included tethering of the cord, hydrocephalus, duplex ureter, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteric reflux, neurogenic bladder, bicornuate uterus, rectovaginal fistula and hereditary spherocytosis. Early diagnosis and surgical excision of a presacral mass is advised to prevent future morbidity and mortality. \nExtrapleural pneumonectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy in the treatment of diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma has been considered a uniformly fatal disease associated with a median survival of 4 to 18 months. Extrapleural pneumonectomy alone has proved disappointing in the treatment of this disease, as have chemotherapy and radiotherapy. From 1980 to 1990, 31 patients with pleural mesothelioma underwent multimodality therapy that included extrapleural pneumonectomy with resection of the pericardium and diaphragm. The age of the patients was 53.4 +/- 8.6 years; 26 were male. All patients had the pathologic diagnosis reviewed before treatment. At thoracotomy six patients had residual (unresectable) gross disease, and in 23 there was histologic evidence of disease at the resection margin. The perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 19% and 6%, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay for the 29 patients who survived the operation was 10.9 +/- 3.5 days. Postoperatively 26 patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cis-platinum chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. The survival rates were 70% at 1 year and 48% at 2 years. Trends toward improved survival in the patients with complete resections approached but did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that this multimodality protocol can be administered with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Prospective trials are justified to further clarify the role of this approach. \nAdamantinoid basal cell carcinoma. An ultrastructural study. We describe an adamantinoid basal cell carcinoma that has developed in the mucocutaneous border of the upper lip. An ultrastructural study disclosed three types of cells that were morphologically distinct in the tumor nest. Cells of the first type were basically the same as those of ordinary basal cell carcinoma. Cells of the second type showed varying degrees of cytoplasmic content loss in a worm-eaten pattern and seemed to consist of degenerating cells. Cells of the third type possessed a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum filled with medium electron-dense fine substance, which was also seen in the extracellular space. In relationship with the histochemical findings, and based on the histogenesis of adamantinoid basal cell carcinoma, we propose that subpopulations of tumor cells undergo spontaneous degeneration and that the spaces of such disappearing cells are refilled with products containing glycosaminoglycans secreted by another subpopulation of the tumor cells. \nCholedochal cyst and biliary atresia in the neonate: imaging findings in five cases. The radiologic findings in five neonates with choledochal cyst associated with extra-hepatic biliary atresia are described. All five patients (age range, 13-72 days) presented with jaundice and acholic stools. In all four patients who underwent sonographic examination, a cystic structure separate from the gallbladder representing the choledochal cyst was shown. The diagnosis of atresia of the distal common bile duct was made preoperatively in all cases by hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and was demonstrated by intraoperative cholangiography in four cases. All patients were successfully treated with surgical intervention within 1 month from the time of diagnosis. Early detection of this rare disorder, which may be distinct from choledochal cyst found in children and adults, is important to prevent fatal complications of biliary obstruction. The combined use of sonography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy can correctly identify this subset of patients with persistent neonatal jaundice and provide valuable information for prompt surgical management. \nHBx gene of hepatitis B virus induces liver cancer in transgenic mice. The exact role of hepatitis B virus in the development of liver cancer is not known. The recent identification of a viral regulatory gene HBx suggests a possible direct involvement of the virus whereby the HBx protein, acting as a transcriptional transactivator of viral genes, may alter host gene expression and lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. We have tested this possibility of placing the entire HBx gene under its own regulatory elements directly into the germline of mice. Transgenic animals harbouring this viral gene succumbed to progressive histopathological changes specifically in the liver, beginning with multifocal areas of altered hepatocytes, followed by the appearance of benign adenomas, and proceeding to the development of malignant carcinomas. Male mice developed disease and died much earlier than females. This transgenic animal model appears ideal for defining the molecular events that follow the expression of the viral HBx gene and are responsible for the development of liver cancer. \nBacterial translocation in trauma patients. Sepsis and multiple system organ failure (MSOF) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients. Bacterial translocation induced by hypotension, endotoxemia, or burns is a reproducible phenomenon in the laboratory. The incidence of bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) in 29 critically ill patients was evaluated to determine its relationship to subsequent sepsis and MSOF. Bacterial translocation was documented in 3 of 4 patients who underwent laparotomy for gastrointestinal (GI) disease. No trauma patient (25 patients), even at second exploration 3-5 days after injury, had a positive MLN culture. Five patients died; 4 trauma patients, one with GI disease. Forty percent of the trauma patients had major complications, predominantly pulmonary infections with gram-negative bacteria. However, infectious complications and outcome were not related to MLN culture results. The classical progression of bacteria from the gut to the bloodstream via the MLNs may require time and gut mucosal injury. The data suggest that bacterial translocation to the MLNs is not a common occurrence in acutely injured trauma patients. \nOptical properties of normal, diseased, and laser photocoagulated myocardium at the Nd: YAG wavelength. Laser photocoagulation of the myocardium effectively destroys arrhythmogenic foci. The purpose of this study was 1) to compare the optical properties of canine myocardium before and after photocoagulation, 2) to compare the canine model with clinical cases by measuring the optical properties of human myocardium, and 3) to assess the optical properties of human myocardial scar and epicardial fat tissue. Measured optical properties were the absorption coefficient, mu a; scattering coefficient, mu s; and scattering anisotropy factor, g. Optical measurements were performed at 1064 nm wavelength on thin plane parallel tissue slices using the integrating sphere method with glass hemispheres on either side of the sample. The study showed 1) an increase of the scattering coefficient by 40% and a two- to threefold increase in reduced scattering coefficient as a result of photocoagulation; 2) that the mu a (0.035 +/- 0.024 mm-1) and mu s (17.9 +/- 3.8 mm-1) of human myocardium were not significantly different from mu a (0.043 +/- 0.021 mm-1) and mu s (17.3 +/- 2.2 mm-1) of canine myocardium, whereas the human g (0.964 +/- 0.005) was slightly different from the canine g (0.974 +/- 0.008); and 3) that the mu a (0.021 +/- 0.016 mm-1) of epicardial fat and mu s (13.8 +/- 1.1 mm-1) of myocardial scar were significantly lower than those of normal myocardium. A dynamic model of laser-tissue interaction incorporating these changes and inhomogeneities is necessary to better describe light distribution during laser photocoagulation. \nAndrogen receptor and the testes influence hypertension in a hybrid rat model. The objective of this study was to determine if males with a deficient androgen receptor would develop hypertension when crossed with a hypertensive parent. Female King-Holtzman rats (n = 15), heterozygous for the testicular feminization (Tfm) gene, were crossed with male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and blood pressure was measured weekly from 5-14 weeks in the F1 hybrid males. Approximately 50% of the F1 hybrid males were Tfm males and androgen receptor-deficient, and 50% were normal. Blood pressure in the parent King-Holtzman males, Tfms, and female rats was also followed for the same time period. The F1 normal male hybrids had a significantly higher (p less than 0.05) systolic blood pressure than the Tfm hybrid males after 12 weeks (195 +/- 8 versus 170 +/- 8 mm Hg, respectively). Blood pressure in the male and Tfm Holtzman rats was 120 +/- 5 mm Hg and 110 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively. Castration lowered blood pressure by 38 mm Hg in the hybrid males and 27 mm Hg in the Tfm hybrids. Female F1 hybrids also showed a pressure rise above that of female Holtzman controls (155 +/- 6 mm Hg versus 110 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) but lower than the F1 males and Tfm hybrids. Ovariectomized females with testosterone implants did not show an elevation in blood pressure. Plasma electrolytes, norepinephrine, and cholesterol were not significantly different between normal and Tfm hybrid males. The results suggest that the presence of an androgen receptor and a testis-derived factor mediate the blood pressure rise in the hybrid males. \nTumor cytokinetic response to total parenteral nutrition in patients with head and neck cancers. Refeeding of patients with malignant tumors may induce tumor-cell DNA synthesis. The present study was aimed at evaluating whether induction of altered cell-cycle kinetics could be induced by intravenous total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in tumor biopsies from head and neck cancers. Nine malnourished patients with squamous cell carcinoma in the head-and-neck area were investigated before and after 5-7 d of continuous TPN. Tumor biopsies were taken in both fasted and fed states for determination of 1) ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, which is rate limiting for polyamine synthesis; 2) flow-cytometric-DNA-distribution measurements; and 3) the fraction of proliferating cells expressed as immunohistochemical reactivity with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. The histopathological differentiation, the fraction of aneuploidic cells, ODC activity, and Ki-67 reactivity were not significantly related to each other, although the number of aneuploidic cells in replicative phases correlated with the number of cells expressing the Ki-67 antigen (r = 0.86, P less than 0.01). Tumor cytokinetics showed no evidence of being changed by TPN administration. \nPreoperative evaluation of the cardiac patient for noncardiac surgery. In summary, obtaining a comprehensive patient history is a critical part of the diagnostic and risk stratification process of the patient with cardiac disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Many of the factors associated with perioperative cardiac morbidity are treatable and early and aggressive management appears to have beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality rates. \nSuperior vena cava syndrome caused by an intrathoracic plasmacytoma. A case of an extramedullary intrathoracic plasmacytoma causing superior vena cava syndrome is described. Review of the literature on intrathoracic plasmacytomas and superior vena cava syndrome revealed that no similar cases have been described to date. The initial presentation, management, and response to treatment are described. \nAcinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas: a rare cause of left-sided portal hypertension. Isolated splenic vein obstruction with left-sided portal hypertension is a rare clinical condition. Owing to the close relationship of the splenic vein and the pancreas, this rare phenomenon is usually secondary to pancreatic inflammation or neoplasm. Acinar cell carcinoma has long been recognized as a distinctive, rare type of pancreatic carcinoma. A case of isolated splenic vein obstruction with left-sided portal hypertension secondary to acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas, which we are reporting here, is thought to the first documented in the literature. \nProteinase-resistant prion protein accumulation in Syrian hamster brain correlates with regional pathology and scrapie infectivity. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that PrPSc, found only in scrapie, is a necessary component of the infectious scrapie agent. Equally compelling is the evidence that its accumulation in the brain causes the neuropathology characteristic of scrapie. We measured the regional concentration of PrPSc in nine brain regions throughout the course of scrapie in the Syrian hamster following intrathalamic inoculation of prions. PrPSc was compared to the regional concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein, a measure of reactive astrocytic gliosis. PrPSc was detected first in the thalamus 14 to 21 days postinoculation and next in the septum at 28 days. Initiation of PrPSc synthesis and accumulation in the thalamus was attributable to the inoculum and in the septum to ventricular spread of de novo synthesized PrPSc. The timing and pattern of PrPSc accumulation in all other brain regions suggested transmission along neuroanatomic pathways. Reactive astrocytic gliosis followed PrPSc accumulation in each region by 1 to 2 weeks. Brain PrPSc, determined by summing the concentrations in each brain region, correlated well with scrapie infectivity titers throughout the course of infection (correlation coefficient = 0.975; slope of linear regression line = 1.136). Our results support the hypothesis that PrPSc participates in both the etiology and pathogenesis of prion diseases. \nSquamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract associated with well-differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid gland. The association of squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract with well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas has rarely been reported in the literature. We report 10 cases illustrating this occurrence. In eight cases, the thyroid carcinoma was discovered accidentally on histological examination of a single neck node, a neck node dissection specimen, an unexpectedly found thyroid nodule, or a systematically resected thyroid lobe, all during surgical treatment of an upper aerodigestive tract carcinoma. In the other two cases, metastatic thyroid neck nodes appeared during the follow-up of a patient with an upper aerodigestive tract carcinoma. No case of upper aerodigestive tract carcinomas was found during the follow-up of thyroid cancer patients. In most cases, adequate thyroid cancer surgery was performed simultaneously or later. Prognosis was essentially determined by the upper aerodigestive tract cancer. \nMechanisms of gastric mucosal injury and protection. This article emphasizes and reviews the premise that because the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal injury is multifactorial, several protective mechanisms should also be considered in analyzing gastric mucosal defense. The first part of the article reviews the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal injury by major etiologic factors such as hypoxia and chemical and biological agents, and emphasizes the common endogenous mediators of damage (e.g, endothelins, leukotrienes, thromboxane, platelet-activating factor, monoamines, free radicals, proteases, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and bile acids--in decreasing potency). The second part of the review is devoted to the gastroprotective mechanisms that are analyzed by anatomical (histologic) location and biochemical processes. The endogenous mediators of acute gastroprotection include prostaglandins, sulfhydryl (SH) compounds, non-SH antioxidants, polyamines, and epidermal growth factor, whereas the protective and mediatory role of glucocorticoids, somatostatin, pentagastrin, histamine, gangliosides, and calcitonin gene-related peptide need further studies. A list of endogenous and exogenous chemicals that exert biphasic, damaging, and protective effects on the gastric mucosa in also included. The final common pathway of acute gastroprotection at the structural and functional level seems to be the preservation of subepithelial microvascular integrity leading to maintenance of mucosal blood flow that allows the energy-dependent rapid restitution (cell migration) from surviving gastric neck cells to repair the superficial epithelial defect. Very new data on the contribution of a histodilutional barrier and release of proteases to gastroprotective processes are also discussed. \nComorbidities and perioperative complications among patients with surgically treated benign prostatic hyperplasia. We address the question of whether or not age and comorbidity are related to intra- and postoperative complications after a transurethral resection. The data are derived from a retrospective, population-based study conducted in Hagen, Germany, which included all patients with an initial prostatectomy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (N = 621) during the five-year period 1984-1988. Seventy-seven percent of the patients had at least one of the following preoperative risk factors: heart disease, hypertension, smoking, chronic obstructive lung disease, and diabetes. There was no intraoperative death. The risk of intraoperative circulatory complications was found to be related to age only for patients without a history of heart diseases or hypertension. The incidence of major complications was 3.1 percent and was significantly higher in the oldest age group. Three patients (0.54%) died postoperatively in the hospital. Infections were the most frequent postoperative complications. The relationship of age and overall postoperative complications was not statistically significant either for patients with (p = 0.121) or without any comorbidity (p = 0.651). Based on this study it seems reasonable to conclude that age is not a clinically relevant risk factor for perioperative complications in patients who have a transurethral resection for benign prostatic hyperplasia. \nTolerance of gastric mucosal flap to postoperative irradiation. When malignant lesions of the oral cavity, base of tongue, and oropharynx are treated with radical resection, adequate reconstruction is required. The free gastric mucosal flap with microvascular transfer is being used with increasing frequency at Washington University Medical Center. Because of the advanced nature of the primary lesions, most patients also require postoperative radiation therapy. In this paper the tolerance of the gastric mucosal flap to postoperative radiation therapy is reviewed. The changes resulting from radiation therapy in the mucosal flap were found to be acceptable, and no major complications were encountered. \nDominantly inherited mitochondrial myopathy with multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA: clinical, morphologic, and biochemical studies. We studied a large family with a dominantly inherited mitochondrial myopathy characterized by progressive external ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, cataract, lactic acidosis, exercise intolerance, and early death. Morphologic studies of muscle biopsies suggested mitochondrial heteroplasmy and revealed ragged-red fibers and decreased histochemical reactions for cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase. Biochemistry showed a partial defect of cytochrome c oxidase and a mild generalized reduction of other mitochondrial enzymes requiring mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits. Southern blot analysis and PCR amplification showed mitochondrial DNA deletions in muscle of all affected members, but not in lymphocytes or fibroblasts, suggesting a tissue-specific distribution. Deletions were multiple and seemed to increase with time and to correlate with the severity of the disease. \nPeriventricular lesions in the white matter on magnetic resonance imaging in the elderly. A morphometric correlation with arteriolosclerosis and dilated perivascular spaces. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed postmortem on the brains of 40 patients aged over 60 yrs who had died from causes other than brain disease. Periventricular lesions of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, graded as moderate or severe, were found in 10% of the patients in the age group between 60 and 69 yrs, and in 50% between 80 and 89 yrs. Macroscopic and microscopic whole-brain sections were studied in 19 brain specimens (8 with normal white matter, 4 with moderate lesions and 7 with severe lesions of the white matter on MRI). The presence or absence of periventricular lesions on MRI correlated well with the severity of demyelination and astrocytic gliosis. Demyelination was always associated with an increased ratio between wall thickness and external diameter of arterioles (up to 150 microns). A variable degree of axonal loss in Bodian-stained sections was present in the white matter of all brains with demyelination. Dilated perivascular spaces were found and studied morphometrically in 9 brain specimens; their presence correlated strongly with corrected brain weight, but incompletely with demyelination and arteriolosclerosis. Our findings suggest that arteriolosclerosis is the primary factor in the pathogenesis of diffuse white matter lesions in the elderly. This is soon followed by demyelination and loss of axons, and only later by dilatation of perivascular spaces. \nSphincter-sparing surgery. Since World War II, a variety of technical innovations have been introduced to preserve the anal sphincter in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis or tumors of the rectum. Studies of anorectal physiology have yielded guidelines for preserving continence and minimizing morbidity. For example, preservation of the anal rectal angle is essential; the rectal mucosa can be removed without impairing neural mechanisms; construction of a reservoir increases rectal compliance. Following these guidelines, surgeons have introduced new techniques and applications benefiting a larger and more varied patient population. Some technical problems remain, however, and patient selection criteria for restorative rectal surgery need to be refined. \nEfficient management of adrenal tumors. A retrospective analysis was carried out on 121 patients with primary adrenal tumors operated on at 2 Vancouver hospitals between the years 1970 and 1990. The purpose of the study was to identify discriminating factors between the various diagnoses in order to minimize both the time and the cost of the investigative process. There were 57 cortical adenomas, 35 pheochromocytomas, 15 carcinomas, 8 cases of cortical hyperplasia, and 6 miscellaneous tumors. The mean time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis of those patients presenting with an identifiable syndrome was 48.3 months. Those with a hypertensive syndrome presented significantly later than those with Cushing's syndrome (57.7 months versus 22.8 months, p less than 0.01). There was a significant delay in diagnosis in those patients with hypertension on the basis of an aldosteronoma as compared with those with hypertension secondary to a pheochromocytoma (75.4 months versus 36.1 months, p = 0.02). Cortical carcinomas were significantly larger than benign cortical tumors (12.7 cm versus 5.5 cm). No malignant neoplasm measured less than 5 cm in diameter. Diagnostic sensitivity for intravenous pyelogram (IVP) was 59%, for ultrasound 71%, for venography 50%, for meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIGB) (pheochromocytoma only) 80%, and for angiography 70%. However, for those patients with adrenal carcinomas, angiography was positive in 100% of cases. Computed tomography (CT) was the most sensitive localizing investigation with a sensitivity of 98%. While other localizing techniques were less sensitive than CT, they may still play a useful role in selected situations. Factors causing delay in diagnosis and the role of the various imaging modalities are discussed. \nNutritional supplementation, psychosocial stimulation, and growth of stunted children: the Jamaican study. The benefits of nutritional supplementation, with or without psychosocial stimulation, on the growth of stunted children were evaluated. Children aged 9-24 mo with lengths less than -2 SD of the National Center for Health Statistics references (n = 129) were randomly assigned to four groups: control, nutritional supplementation, stimulation, and both interventions. A fifth group with lengths greater than -1 SD was also enrolled. Length, weight, head and arm circumferences, and triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses were measured on enrollment and 6 and 12 mo later. Multiple-regression analysis was used to determine the effects of the interventions in which age, sex, initial status, initial dietary intake, and several socioeconomic variables were controlled for. Stimulation had no effect on growth and there was no interaction between the interventions. After 12 mo supplemented children had significantly increased length, weight, and head circumference (all P less than 0.01). The effects of supplementation were not cumulative but occurred in the first 6 mo. \nGastric carcinoma presenting as an exacerbation of ulcers during pregnancy. A case report. Gastric cancer is unusual during pregnancy. Also, because of the physiologic changes that occur with pregnancy, it is rare to see a worsening of peptic ulcers during pregnancy. A patient with an exacerbation of peptic ulcers presented with gastric carcinoma during pregnancy. \nStress fractures in athletes. How to spot this underdiagnosed injury. Stress fractures are an increasingly common injury in competitive athletes, especially runners. Amenorrheic athletes are at particularly high risk. A radionuclide bone scan should be considered when the index of suspicion for stress fracture is high. Plain radiographs are of little use in establishing the diagnosis in the early stages of the injury. Early diagnosis and prompt institution of conservative therapy allow for a favorable outcome in most cases. Avoidance of or reduced participation in the inciting activity is important for pain control. Certain stress fractures, such as those involving the femoral neck, should be monitored closely and treated aggressively with internal fixation when conservative measures fail. Runners who have exercise-induced amenorrhea should be advised to decrease their training intensity to a level where menses resume. Cyclic therapy with conjugated estrogens and progesterone should also be considered, as should daily calcium supplementation. \nMortality, neoplasia, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone in the United Kingdom OBJECTIVE--To determine the cause of death and incidence of neoplasia in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone. DESIGN--A long term cohort study established to receive details of death certification and tumour registrations through the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and NHS central register. PATIENTS--All patients (1246 male, 662 female) treated for short stature with pituitary growth hormone under the Medical Research Council working party and health services human growth hormone committee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death or development of neoplasia. RESULTS--110 patients died (68 male, 42 female; aged 0.9-57 years) from 1972 to 1990. Fifty three death were from neoplasia responsible for growth hormone deficiency (27 craniopharyngioma, 24 other intracranial tumour, two leukaemia); two from histiocytosis X; and 13 from pituitary insufficiency. Six patients died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, six of other neurological disorders, and eight of acute infection. Other deaths were apparently unrelated to growth hormone deficiency or its treatment. Seventeen tumours (in 16 patients) were identified during or after growth hormone treatment. Four were in patients with previous intracranial neoplasia and two were after cranial irradiation. Thirteen were intracranial, the others being Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, carcinoma of colon, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS--Recurrence or progression of intracranial tumours and potentially avoidable metabolic consequences of hypopituitarism were the main causes of death. Growth hormone treatment probably did not contribute to new tumour development. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after pituitary growth hormone treatment continues to occur in the United Kingdom. This cohort must remain under long term review. \nNeutralizing antibodies to interferon-alpha: relative frequency in patients treated with different interferon preparations. The frequencies of antibody development so far reported in patients treated with different interferons (IFNs) are not readily comparable because of differences in treatment regimens and assay methods. Thus the frequency of neutralizing antibody development was analyzed in a large sample of sera derived from a relatively homogeneous group of patients treated with different IFN-alpha preparations. The frequency of developing neutralizing antibody to IFN varied according to the IFN given. Particularly, the seroconversion frequency was significantly higher in patients treated with recombinant IFN-alpha 2a (20.2%) than in patients treated with either recombinant IFN-alpha 2b (6.9%) or IFN-alpha N1 (1.2%), a lymphoblastoid IFN-alpha. Furthermore, sera obtained from patients treated with either recombinant IFN neutralized both types of recombinant IFNs but failed to neutralize IFN-alpha N1. \nGlial fibrillary acidic protein expression in pleomorphic adenoma, chordoma, and astrocytoma. A comparison of three antibodies. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a major constituent of glial cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression has been accepted as a marker of astroglial differentiation or origin. However, GFAP expression has been demonstrated in a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues outside the central nervous system, including pleomorphic adenomas, chordomas, bone, and cartilage. It has been postulated that coexpression of GFAP and vimentin in neoplastic myoepithelial cells in pleomorphic adenomas reflects early chondroid differentiation. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in chondromyxoid and chordoid tumors was studied in formaldehyde solution-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 20 pleomorphic adenomas and 10 chordomas by the immunoperoxidase method with the use of commercially available monoclonal (n = 2) and polyclonal (n = 1) antibodies. All pleomorphic adenomas and chordomas demonstrated expression of GFAP with the use of the polyclonal antibody (Biomeda Corp [Foster City, Calif]). Variable expression of GFAP was present in 90% (18/20) and 70% (14/20) of pleomorphic adenomas, and in 20% (2/10) and 0% of chordomas, with the use of the two monoclonal preparations (Dakopatts [Glostrup, Denmark] and BioGenex Laboratories [San Ramon, Calif]), respectively. Normal brain tissue and eight astrocytomas were used as \"controls\" to compare staining intensity and quality between the polyclonal and monoclonal anti-GFAP antibodies. Glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity with the polyclonal antibody was more intense than that with either monoclonal antibody despite similar (congruent) distributions of tumor cell types that were stained in control brain and astrocytoma tissues. The GFAP polyclonal antibody was more frequently immunoreactive than the monoclonal antibodies, particularly in cells that exhibited chondroid differentiation. These findings may have practical application in surgical pathology. \nUse of endovascular stents in congenital heart disease. BACKGROUND. Balloon expandable intravascular stents have been used to support vessel walls in coronary and peripheral arteries in adults. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of these stents in the treatment of congenital heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS. Forty-five stents were placed in 30 patients, who were 0.2-30.2 years old (weight, 3.5-76 kg). Patients with areas of stenosis that were difficult to approach surgically were chosen. Stents were mounted over balloons and placed by standard catheterization techniques. Twenty-three patients had branch pulmonary artery stenosis. Thirty-six stents were placed successfully and had reduced pressure gradients from 50.6 +/- 24 to 15.9 +/- 13.4 mm Hg. Five patients had stents placed after atrial surgery: three in obstructed Fontan repairs, one at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction after sinus venous defect repair, and one at the site of a Glenn shunt. Atrial stents reduced pressure gradients from 9.8 +/- 8.2 to 2.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. One patient had a stent placed in the descending aorta after coarctation dilation, and the pressure gradient was reduced from 50 to 25 mm Hg. One patient had pulmonary vein dilation with stent placement. Two stents migrated at the time of placement; one required surgical removal, and one was anchored in place by balloon dilation. One patient died within 24 hours of catheterization because of thrombus obstruction of the Fontan repair. Nine patients have undergone recatheterization. All stented vessels have remained at the same caliber as at original stent placement. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that balloon expandable stents are useful in selected postoperative stenoses in congenital heart disease. \nIntracerebral hemorrhage related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and t-PA treatment. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) has been approved as thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, but this agent can cause serious bleeding complications including intracerebral hemorrhages. Mechanisms underlying the development of these hemorrhages have not been clarified. We report a patient who developed two intracerebral hemorrhages shortly after receiving t-PA for the treatment of an acute myocardial infarction, and who was found to have cerebral amyloid angiopathy at autopsy. Staining of cortical sections with Congo red and an antibody directed against beta amyloid protein (A4 peptide) disclosed specific involvement of most of the subarachnoid and superficial cortical vessels in the region of the two hemorrhages. Based on the findings in this patient and in 6 additional patients reported recently, it is likely that cerebral amyloid angiopathy plays a pathogenic role in some intracerebral hemorrhages associated with the administration of t-PA. The cautious use of t-PA with heparin in patients who are elderly or demented may be advisable. \nRadical prostatectomy for stage A adenocarcinoma of the prostate: staging errors and their implications for treatment recommendations and disease outcome. Of 148 patients with clinical stage A1 (32) or A2 (116) disease who had radical prostatectomy only 63% and 62%, respectively, had pathological stage A disease. Although 25% of those with clinical stage A1 and 9% of those with clinical stage A2 disease had no cancer at radical prostatectomy, 12% and 29%, respectively, had pathological stage C disease or higher. Clinical Mayo grade 1 was never associated with extracapsular disease but 60% of those with grade 3 or higher tumor did have extracapsular disease. Over-all survival was comparable to the expected survival. Clinical stage A2 cancer was associated with a significantly higher progression rate (when prostate specific antigen values were considered, p = 0.0011) and cancer death rate (p less than 0.045) than stage A1 disease, whereas pathological stage was not significantly related to disease outcome, possibly because of the use of adjuvant treatment (hormonal or radiation) for some patients with pathological stage C or higher disease. The vagaries of clinical staging associated with stage A disease, as well as the previously documented progression on long-term followup (8 to 10 years) in younger (60 years old or less) patients with stage A1 prostate cancer make radical prostatectomy with its limited morbidity an acceptable treatment choice. \nGroup B streptococcal endocarditis of tricuspid valve. We report three cases of group B streptococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve. Two patients were intravenous drug abusers. In the literature review, and including our cases, ten patients had group B streptococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve. Half of the patients were intravenous drug abusers. Four of the other patients had underlying conditions. All patients were treated with a penicillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Three patients underwent tricuspid valve surgery. The overall mortality was 20 percent. Both patients who died received medical therapy only. \nCoronary artery narrowing due to extrinsic compression by myocardial abscess. A case of aortic valve endocarditis complicated by perivalvular abscess extending into myocardium is presented. Echocardiography and aortography failed to detect the abscess, but coronary angiography revealed its presence by extrinsic compression of left anterior descending and diagonal arteries. Morphological features of this rare cause for coronary narrowing are described. \nSurgical treatment of concomitant urethral diverticulum and stress incontinence. Urinary incontinence is frequently associated with a urethral diverticulum in female patients. Preoperative evaluation including a thorough history and physical examination, voiding cystourethrogram, urethroscopy, and urodynamic studies can diagnose both the urethral diverticulum and any concomitant bladder-urethral dysfunction. Preoperative recognition of stress urinary incontinence or patients at risk for this problem postoperatively permits effective treatment with concomitant transvaginal bladder neck suspension and urethral diverticulectomy. \nTreatment of chronic infected hip arthroplasty wounds by radical debridement and obliteration with pedicled and free muscle flaps. Nine patients with extensive wounds of the hip joint due to chronic infection following total hip arthroplasty or internal fixation of fractures of the femoral head and neck have been treated by serial radical debridements to remove infected bone, contaminated remnants of bone cement, and the surrounding fibrotic soft tissues. The resultant deep cavity extending down to the acetabulum has then been obliterated with either pedicled muscle flaps or free muscle flaps. Subcutaneous or transpelvic transposition of rectus abdominis muscle flaps is preferred for smaller defects, but only the free latissimus dorsi muscle flap provides sufficient volume of tissue to obliterate the more extensive hip defects. Systemic antibiotics have been continued only for a short-term course of 14 days postoperatively. There has been no recurrence of infection, with follow-up ranging between 6 months and 3 1/4 years. One patient has undergone reimplantation of a second custom hip prosthesis into the vascularized bed of a free latissimus dorsi muscle flap. \nA modified technique for obliteration of large bony defects after cystectomy. Thirteen cysts treated by enucleation followed by collapsing an osteoperiosteal flap to eliminate dead space are presented. Four of the cysts were dentigerous and nine were radicular. The bony defects ranged in size from 3 to 7 cm in greatest dimension. Healing by primary intention occurred in all cases. This method has been found to be successful in the obliteration of large bony defects after cystectomy. \nA comparative trial of the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Outcome in 3- to 8-month-old infants, 9- to 23-month-old infants and children, and 24- to 30-month-old children. The reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids were compared in 139 infants aged 3 to 8 months, 60 infants and children aged 9 to 23 months, and 99 children aged 24 to 30 months. Good antibody responses to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and agglutinogens occurred in all age groups after both the third and fourth doses. After the fourth (booster) dose, the mean antibody values in initially seronegative infants vaccinated at 3 to 8 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 67.8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU) per milliliter; anti-FHA, 149.5 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 125.6. The values in initially seronegative children vaccinated at 24 to 30 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 92.9 EU/mL; anti-FHA, 251.7 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 275.8. Reactions following immunization were minimal. Except for drowsiness after the first dose in infants, there were no clinically significant differences in reactions between infants and older children. The findings in this study coupled with the recent demonstration of efficacy of this vaccine in 2-year-old children supports the recent Japanese recommendation to lower the age of immunization with acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids to 3 months. \nHemifacial spasm in an infant due to fourth ventricular ganglioglioma. Case report. The case of an infant is reported in which hemifacial spasm due to a ganglioglioma of the fourth ventricle was relieved by surgery. Previously described causes of hemifacial spasm are summarized, and the relevance of this case to theories on the pathogenesis of the condition is discussed. \nThe influence of severity of spinal cord ischemia in the etiology of delayed-onset paraplegia. To clarify the cause of delayed-onset paraplegia, the authors evaluated the neurologic outcome after temporary (10 to 30 minutes) spinal cord ischemia in the awake rabbit. Loss of motor function occurred in less than 2 minutes in all animals. Restoration of flow within 16 minutes always resulted in full return of function, whereas with occlusion times of greater than 27 minutes all animals remained paralyzed. After temporary occlusion of 20 to 21 minutes, however, 71% of animals returned to normal neurologic function but developed delayed-onset paraplegia 14 to 48 hours later. This appears to be a reliable method for the creation of a model of delayed-onset paraplegia in the awake animal, and will facilitate more detailed studies of the pathophysiology of ischemia-induced paraplegia. \nLong-term results after lateral cranial base surgery. The surgical management of patients with slow-growing benign temporal bone neoplasms has been criticized because of its significant morbidity and mortality compared with results after radiation therapy, but long-term control by irradiation remains unproved. Long-term surgical results have not been studied previously. One hundred twenty-nine skull base operations were performed in 126 patients at the Otology Group, Nashville, Tenn., from January 1970 through May 1987. Fifty-eight patients responded to questionnaires focusing on recovery from loss of cranial nerves. All patients regained some degree of facial function (class V or better), no alimentary tubes or tracheotomies were in use, and no patients had debilitating aspiration. Long-term compensation from the cranial nerve deficits of lateral skull base surgery can be expected in most patients and should not be used as an argument for irradiation in patients with a long life expectancy at time of diagnosis. \nGastric mucosal pH as a prognostic index of mortality in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if measurements of gastric intramucosal pH have prognostic implications regarding ICU mortality. DESIGN: Prospective comparison of outcome. SETTING: General adult ICUs in two teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Eighty consecutive patients age 18 to 84 yrs (mean 63.4), 50 men and 30 women, 55% in the medical and 45% in the surgical services. METHODS: Gastric intramucosal pH was measured on ICU admission and again 12 hrs later. A value of greater than or equal to 7.35 was used to differentiate between normal and low gastric intramucosal pH. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-four patients had a normal gastric intramucosal pH and 26 patients had a low gastric intramucosal pH on ICU admission. The mortality rate was greater in the low gastric intramucosal pH group (65.4% vs. 43.6%; p less than .04). The frequency of sepsis and the presence of multisystem organ failure also were greater in the low gastric intramucosal pH group (p less than .01). Further stratification of patients according to gastric intramucosal pH measured 12 hrs after admission showed a greater mortality rate in patients with persistently low gastric intramucosal pH when compared with patients with normal gastric intramucosal pH during the first 12 hrs (86.7% vs. 26.8%; p less than .001). CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of gastric intramucosal pH on ICU admission, and again 12 hrs later, have a high specificity for predicting patient survival in this ICU patient population (77.8% to 80.6%). Furthermore, given its relative noninvasive nature, tonometrically measured gastric intramucosal pH may be a useful addition to patient monitoring in the ICU. \nAllele loss at the retinoblastoma locus in human ovarian cancer. To gain a broad spectrum on allelic loss of specific loci in ovarian tumors, we initially examined DNA from 23 pairs of ovarian tumors and matched peripheral blood lymphocyte samples from the same patients, using 27 polymorphic DNA markers distributed on 13 chromosomes. Significant high frequency of allelic deletion (22%-44%) at chromosome 13 loci (D13S31, D13S32, D13S33, and D13S34) at bands q12-q34 was observed in tumor tissues. These results led us to investigate the loss of heterozygosity at the retinoblastoma (RB) locus in ovarian tumors, because the RB gene is a tumor-suppressor gene located at 13q14. Analysis of the variable number of tandem repeat sequence polymorphism in intron 20 in the RB gene revealed that 6 (30%) of 20 patients with informative samples showed allelic loss at the RB locus in their tumor tissues. This loss, of relatively high frequency, suggests that the RB gene, or a closely linked gene, seems to be involved in the development of ovarian cancer. \nExertional sudden death in soldiers. To address the problem of a significant rise in the incidence of exertional sudden death worldwide, the medical records and necropsy reports of all deaths that occurred in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) during 1974-1986 were scrutinized. Twenty male soldiers, aged 18-29 yr, died suddenly and unexpectedly within 24 h of strenuous exercise. Necropsy results, available for 90% of the subjects, included underlying cardiac disease in 50% and noncardiac causes of death in 33.3%; the cause of death was unidentifiable in 16.7% of the subjects. Prodromal symptoms in 70% of the subjects are presented as a main focus of this investigation. The most frequently reported symptom was exertional or nonexertional syncope in 40% of the subjects. Chest pain, acute gastrointestinal symptoms, or febrile disease were reported in 30% of the cases. The findings of this research suggest that syncope is a major antecedent symptom of exertional sudden death. An attack of syncope in young conditioned individuals should be followed by thorough medical surveillance, and strenuous exercise should be avoided until this procedure is completed. Sports and military officials have the obligation to promote awareness that strenuous exercise should not be performed in the presence of acute gastrointestinal symptoms or febrile illness. \nPrevention of portal hypertension and portosystemic shunts by early chronic administration of clonidine in conscious portal vein-stenosed rats. The hemodynamic effects, including mesenteric-systemic shunts of early chronic administration of clonidine, were studied in conscious, unrestrained, portal vein-stenosed rats. In rats receiving early chronic clonidine (600 micrograms.kg-1.day-1 by gavage), begun 3 days before portal vein stenosis and then administered continuously for 10 consecutive days, portal pressure (10.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) and degree of mesenteric-systemic shunts (58% +/- 25%) were significantly lower than in the placebo group (15.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg and 83% +/- 7%, respectively). The effects were observed either 2 to 3 hr or 18 to 24 hr after the last dose of clonidine. In rats receiving clonidine continuously for 5 days, starting 5 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) was significantly lower than in the placebo group, but mesenteric-systemic shunts (82% +/- 8%) were not significantly different. In rats receiving a single oral dose of clonidine (600 micrograms/kg) 10 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg), measured 2 to 3 hr after clonidine administration, was significantly lower than in the placebo group. Mesenteric-systemic shunts (83% +/- 8%), however, were not significantly different from the placebo group. In addition, 18 to 24 hr after a single dose of clonidine, hemodynamic values returned to basal conditions. We also demonstrated that chronic clonidine administration begun before portal vein stenosis can reduce the initial increase in portal pressure after this procedure. We concluded that early chronic clonidine administration reduces the severity of portal hypertension and the development of portosystemic shunts in portal vein-stenosed rats. \nCerebrospinal fluid atrial natriuretic factor in intracranial disease. We tested the hypothesis that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is an indicator of brain injury in patients with intracranial disease. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was measured in 72 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 28 patients with intraventricular drains and in nine samples from outpatient controls undergoing diagnostic lumbar puncture. Levels were correlated with diagnosis; systemic fluid administration; concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma; intracranial pressure; sodium, glucose, and protein concentrations, osmolality, and cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid; sodium concentration in the serum; and hemodynamics. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was highest in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with intracerebral hematoma, followed by those with obstructive hydrocephalus and subarachnoid hemorrhage (19 +/- 2, 13 +/- 3, and 8 +/- 2 pg/ml, respectively); atrial natriuretic factor concentration was less than 4 pg/ml in the controls. Patients treated with fluid restriction had significantly higher atrial natriuretic factor levels than those receiving maintenance or high-volume fluids (16 +/- 3, 8 +/- 2, 10 +/- 1 pg/ml, respectively). The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma was significantly elevated in patients with intracerebral hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage (155 +/- 38 and 92 +/- 20 pg/ml, respectively) and did not correlate with fluid administration or the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid. Neither cerebrospinal fluid nor plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor correlated with intracranial pressure; cerebrospinal fluid sodium, glucose, or protein concentrations, osmolality, or cell count; serum sodium concentration; or hemodynamics. We conclude that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is a nonspecific indicator of brain injury. \nInfluence of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia on the pattern of left ventricular diastolic filling: a Doppler echocardiographic study Previous studies using Doppler echocardiography to evaluate left ventricular diastolic filling have shown that myocardial ischemia induced by coronary balloon angioplasty or atrial pacing results in a decrease in the left ventricular inflow peak early (E) to peak atrial (A) velocity ratio. To investigate the effects of exercise-induced ischemia on Doppler-derived filling variables, 20 patients with coronary artery disease and exercise-induced electrocardiographic changes and regional wall motion abnormalities determined by two-dimensional echocardiography were evaluated and compared with 20 patients without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Doppler echocardiography was performed at rest and immediately after exercise before the resolution of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities. Peak E and A velocities increased from rest to postexercise in both the ischemic and nonischemic groups, although the ischemic group demonstrated a greater increase in peak E velocity (from 68 +/- 15 cm/s at rest to 88 +/- 22 cm/s after exercise) than the nonischemic group (70 +/- 13 to 77 +/- 18 cm/s) (p less than 0.05 for the difference in response between groups). Accompanying these changes was a slight increase in the peak E/A velocity ratio in the ischemic group (1.04 +/- 0.28 at rest to 1.13 +/- 0.42 after exercise) versus a decrease in the nonischemic group (1.07 +/- 0.30 to 0.90 +/- 0.28) (p less than 0.05 intergroup difference). \nLong-term consequences of CNS treatment for childhood cancer, Part I: Pathologic consequences and potential for oncogenesis. The pathologic changes associated with the treatment of cancer of the nervous system are reviewed. Computed tomographic, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomographic findings of these abnormalities are described, followed by discussion of the known histopathologic features. For the most part, pathologic effects are primary vascular and/or demyelinating. We review each of these effects at all levels of the neural axis. This review concludes with a discussion of the risk of developing second malignancies. Although this complication is infrequent, the likelihood that survivors of childhood cancer will develop a second malignancy is 10 times that of age-matched controls. This phenomenon in part relates to genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and host susceptibility. These qualifications not withstanding, most studies implicate central nervous system radiation with and without chemotherapy as the primary etiology for second malignancies. \nLymphomatous presentation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A subgroup at high risk of early treatment failure. Multivariate analyses of the clinical course of 1537 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identified a subgroup which experienced short remission duration and a high incidence of extramedullary relapse. The patients differed from other ALL patients by the presence at diagnosis of two or more of a constellation of clinical and laboratory features: organomegaly or mass disease, E-rosette positivity, hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dl, leukocyte count greater than 50,000/microliters, male predominance, and older age. This type of presentation of ALL is referred to as the \"lymphoma syndrome\" (LS) since such patients exhibit a pattern of several clinical and laboratory features which were observed repeatedly but in differing combinations, and some of which clinically resemble lymphoma. A subsequent database from 2231 patients was analyzed. Patients with a mediastinal mass, massive splenomegaly, or massive adenopathy, alone or in combination, had a worse outcome when the patient also had either leukocytosis, E-rosette-positive lymphoblasts, or a normal or near normal hemoglobin (Hb) level at diagnosis. Similarly, the above three laboratory features alone or in combination did not predict less than 40% disease-free survival (DFS) unless they were accompanied by at least one of the clinical features of mass disease. When at least one clinical feature and at least one laboratory feature were present, the overall DFS was 36% 6 years after diagnosis versus 64% for all other patients. The association of these features with poor prognosis remained significant after adjusting for the level of leukocyte count at diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and sex of the patients. Patients with this recurrent syndrome of features do not represent a homogeneous biologic entity but they constitute a subgroup of patients with ALL having a high risk of treatment failure using current therapies, including failure to achieve remission, early relapse, and increased frequency of relapse in extramedullary sites. They deserve early recognition at diagnosis and selection of treatment strategies appropriate for very high risk ALL. \nIntraoperative use of a 2-mm choledochoscope for the exploration of small bile ducts and the pancreatic duct. Intraoperative visualization of the biliary and pancreatic ducts can be difficult in a nondilated system. Very small extra- and intrahepatic bile ducts occasionally require visualization but do not admit the traditional 6.5-mm intraoperative flexible choledochoscope. We have prospectively examined the use of a 2-mm choledochoscope for the intraoperative evaluation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts in 36 patients. In 27 patients, the choledochoscope was advanced through the cystic duct stump for examination of the common bile duct following cholangiography. The scope was successfully passed into the cystic duct stump and into the common bile duct in 76 per cent of patients. Inability to pass the scope through the cystic duct was usually due to acute angulation of the cystic duct/common duct junction. In an additional five patients, intraoperative cholangiography revealed a filling defect in a very small duct. A choledochotomy was made and the 2-mm choledochoscope was used to exclude the presence of stones in a small bile duct. In four patients the choledochoscope was used during a Puestow procedure to visualize and help extract stones in the tail and head of the gland. No complications occurred in these patients due to the use of the choledochoscope. We conclude that the 2-mm choledochoscope aids in internal visualization of small intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts and the pancreatic duct. It may be useful as an adjunct to cholangiography in determining the nature of filling defects. \nAAEM case report #21: hemifacial spasm: preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative management. A 75-year-old man developed progressive involuntary hemifacial spasm. Electrophysiologic evidence of abnormal cross-transmission between neurons of the facial nerve was demonstrated. Electrodiagnostic studies were used to confirm the diagnosis preoperatively and determine the adequacy of vascular decompression of the facial nerve intraoperatively. \nGeneration and cloning of stable human IgE-secreting cells that have rearranged the C epsilon gene. Although the secretion of Ig isotypes other than IgM is generally accompanied by a DNA rearrangement that deletes C mu (and the other IgCH genes located between VDJ and the expressed CH gene), a system has recently been described that generates a high frequency of IgE-secreting cells that have failed to delete IgCH genes or to rearrange their C epsilon genes. These cells, derived from EBV-transformed human PBMC, secrete IgM and IgD as well as IgE. To determine whether the absence of C epsilon rearrangement and CH gene deletion is a general phenomenon for human IgE-secreting cells, we have characterized IgE-secreting cells that are generated by culturing purified human B cells with EBV plus IL-4 in the presence of irradiated human PBMC. In contrast to the earlier observation, we have not been able to detect any cells that demonstrate cytoplasmic staining for IgE and concurrently stain for a second Ig isotype. Stable IgE-secreting cell lines and clones produced by this method have rearranged one of their C epsilon genes and have deleted both C mu genes. These observations demonstrate that the generation of human IgE-secreting cells can involve the same gene rearrangement and deletional mechanisms that lead to the generation of cells that secrete other isotypes. \nLower-extremity vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease: prospective evaluation with duplex Doppler sonography. Eighty-five men with 92 vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity underwent a total of 264 examinations with duplex Doppler over a 2.5-year period. In 64 patients who underwent more than one examination, the total follow-up encompassed 740 months. In 220 native femoral arteries (96.0%) the peak systolic velocity (PSV) was higher than that in the graft. Arteriovenous shunting was associated with a normal PSV and a markedly elevated diastolic component at spectral analysis. Focal fluid collections were common initially near the graft and usually disappeared uneventfully. An average PSV of 32 cm/sec or less was always associated with impending occlusion. The sensitivity of an average PSV of 40 cm/sec or less to indicate impending graft occlusion by the next visit was only 33%; the specificity, 94%. At initial examination, stenoses were associated with high PSV focally in the graft or low PSV with absent diastolic flow. \nThe role of family structure, functioning, and pain modeling in headache. In an initial attempt to examine relationships between family functioning and chronic headache disorders, the present study examined: a) family structure characteristics, b) family functioning, and c) family pain modeling. Subjects completed an assessment battery consisting of several measures of family functioning. Analyses showed that migraine sufferers (N = 42) as compared to headache-free controls (N = 59) were more likely to describe their families as emphasizing clear organization, structure, rules, and overall control, but less likely to encourage emotional expression. No differences were found between tension headache subjects (N = 43) and headache-free controls. While only an initial exploration of the importance of family characteristics in chronic headache, these results suggest that there are important differences in headache subjects' (particularly migraine) reports of family environment and functioning. \nCommunity cancer programs as strategic alliances: challenges and guidelines for action. This paper assesses the utility of strategic alliances as a way of expanding and improving the quality of cancer care provided in communities with limited access to major treatment centres. Alliances provide an organizational model for future community-based cancer programs by accommodating a growing need for interdependence among organizations and providers while permitting substantial independence and autonomy. Five managerial challenges to ensuring effective and efficient delivery of cancer services are identified: to secure mutually reinforcing exchanges between and within all levels of cancer care, to develop protocols and programs relevant to the unique characteristics of patients and providers, to provide treatment and cancer control services, to involve interdisciplinary teams of providers at all levels of care and to achieve quality assurance, improvement and evaluation. In addition, the paper includes a set of guidelines to facilitate the implementation of community cancer programs as strategic alliances: reaffirm the role of community oncologists, primary care physicians and nurses as partners in the program; define the structure and culture necessary for commitment rather than simply compliance; redefine the role of management; establish data-monitoring systems; modify reward systems; and set realistic time frames and expectations. \nAbdominal CT findings after liver transplantation in 66 patients. CT scanning is used frequently to assess the condition of patients after liver transplantation. The CT records of 174 adult patients who underwent liver transplantation were studied retrospectively to determine the number and timing of CT studies as well as the frequency and significance of the findings. One-hundred seventy CT scans were obtained in 66 (38%) of the 174 patients, with a mean of 2.6 scans/patient. The interval between transplantation and scanning was 1 day to 24 months; in 59 (89%) of 66 patients, the first CT scan was obtained within 30 days. The acute indications for CT scanning were fever or leukocytosis in 54 (92%) of 59 patients and abnormal liver function tests in five (8%) of 59 patients. CT scans obtained more than 30 days after transplantation were repeat scans in all but seven patients. Indications in this latter group were the same as for the acute group, plus evaluation of hepatic neoplasia in three patients. CT findings included periportal low attenuation in 41 (62%) of 66 patients; ascites in 25 (38%); splenomegaly in 19 (29%); loculated intraperitoneal noninfected fluid collections in 13 (20%); intrahepatic, splenic, pancreatic, or perihepatic abscesses in seven (11%); hepatic infarction in six (9%); splenic infarction in three (4%); and hepatic calcification in two (3%). Other major abnormalities included inferior vena caval thrombosis (one patient), pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery with rupture (one patient), and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (one patient). CT scanning after liver transplantation is used predominantly in the acute setting to evaluate for liver infarction or intraabdominal abscess. In this setting, CT showed these abnormalities, in addition to tumor recurrence or vascular abnormalities, in 15 (23%) of 66 patients. \nComparison of allografts and prosthetic valves when used for emergency aortic valve replacement for active infective endocarditis. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) using allografts is an established method of treating aortic valve disease. It is uncertain, however, whether the increased technical demands of allograft AVR can be justified in emergency operations. This study reports 15 patients treated between 1987 and 1990 for acute bacterial or fungal endocarditis involving the aortic valve. Patients underwent emergency AVR because of severe congestive failure, overwhelming sepsis or cerebral emboli. Eight patients received prosthetic valves (group I: 4 mechanical, 4 porcine) and 7 received human allografts (group II: 5 aortic and 2 pulmonary). The groups were comparable in age (group I, 55 years; group II, 51 years), intravenous drug abuse (group I, 1; group II, 3), and previous AVR (group I, 3; group II, 2). One group I and 4 group II patients had septal abscesses. Additional procedures in group I included mitral valve replacement (2), tricuspid valve replacement (1) and aortic root replacement (1). Additional procedures in group II were mitral valve repair (1), root replacement (1), atrial septal defect closure (1) and aortocoronary bypass (1). Mean bypass times (group I, 189 minutes; group II, 204 minutes) and cross-clamp times (group I; 108 minutes; group II, 121 minutes) were similar. Operative deaths occurred in 4 of 8 group I and 1 of 7 group II patients. All surviving patients have been successfully followed (group I, 28 months; group II, 18 months). No group I patient has required reoperation. One group II patients required reoperation for recurrent infection affecting the allograft, and another group II patient died 10 months postoperatively from noncardiac causes. \nHearing aid prescribing: is the specialist opinion necessary? A restructuring of the service for provision of hearing aids has been proposed by the Royal National Institute for the Deaf. This is based on the assumption that very few patients referred for hearing aids have significant ear disease and it is not necessary for them to see an ENT specialist. The case notes of 200 consecutive patients referred to the Hearing Aid clinic were reviewed. In only half of these would a hearing aid have been prescribed without a specialist opinion. The remainder either did not need a hearing aid or required further investigation and surgical or medical treatment. In addition there was significant evidence of lack of expertise amongst General Practitioners in recognizing ear disorders. It is imperative that any patient requiring a hearing aid be seen by someone experienced in otology rather than be dealt with by the General Practitioner alone. \nFlow cytometric determination of the multidrug resistant phenotype in transitional cell cancer of the bladder: implications and applications. We detail our experience with a monoclonal antibody to detect the cell surface P-glycoprotein product of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1) in the human bladder. A total of 32 patients had 44 different specimens analyzed. The samples consisted of 8 normal bladders, 21 transitional cell carcinomas, 1 mucinous adenocarcinoma, 3 P-0 bladder wall specimens and 10 nonmalignant urothelial samples from cystectomies. P-glycoprotein was not detected in the normal adult or pediatric bladder. Bladder specimens from 3 children with a neurogenic bladder revealed enhanced expression (21%, 14% and 4% positivity). Transitional cell carcinoma usually demonstrates low expression at diagnosis (less than 6%), although 3 patients had enhanced initial expression (11%, 12% and 31%). Three patients treated with chemotherapy demonstrated 56%, 76% and 50% expression of MDR-1. Nonmalignant tissue from cystectomy specimens had low expression of MDR-1. The specificity of this system was confirmed with human bladder cell lines. The ability of flow cytometry to detect and quantify the expression of MDR-1 may allow for the early detection of chemotherapy resistance in patients with transitional cell carcinoma treated with systemic and intravesical therapy. \nAdministration of sucralfate prolongs survival of animals with experimental peptic ulceration. Ligation of the pig bile duct (BDL) results in 100% incidence of pars esophageal ulceration within 48 hours of the procedure. Usually such ulceration is uniformly fatal unless a highly selective vagotomy is performed simultaneously with the BDL. The administration of sucralfate to pigs with BDL prolonged their survival for up to 7 days, with evidence of healing of the ulcer on macroscopic and histologic observations. An increase in cell proliferation in the squamous epithelium of the ulcerated area was also seen in this sucralfate group. These features were not seen in controls, pigs with BDL only, or pigs with BDL and with magaldrate (Riopone), colloidal bismuth subcitrate (DeNol), or carbenoxolone. Analysis by Sepharose 2B gel filtration showed that there was no significant difference in the amounts of polymeric mucin in any group, with a wide scatter of the data seen especially for pigs in the untreated BDL-only group. This study suggests that sucralfate may enhance healing in this experimental pig ulcer model via a mechanism independent of the stimulation of mucus secretion. We propose that coating the mucosa with sucralfate provides a temporary substitute barrier that creates a microenvironment conducive to wound repair by mucosal proliferation. \nImpact of variability among surgeons on postoperative morbidity and mortality and ultimate survival. OBJECTIVE--To assess the differences among surgeons in postoperative complications, postoperative mortality, and survival in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. DESIGN--Prospective study of patients with colorectal cancer managed by one of 13 consultant surgeons, none of whom had a special interest in colorectal surgery. SETTING--Royal Infirmary, Glasgow. PATIENTS--645 sequential patients with colorectal cancer presenting over the six years from 1974 to 1979. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Postoperative complications, postoperative mortality (within 30 days), and survival (up to 10 years); predictive factors for postoperative mortality and survival; and relative hazard rate ratios for individual surgeons. RESULTS--The proportion of patients undergoing apparently curative resection varied among surgeons from 40% to 76%; overall postoperative mortality varied from 8% to 30%. After curative resection postoperative mortality varied from 0% to 20%, local recurrence from 0% to 21%, and the rate of anastomotic leak from 0% to 25%. Survival at 10 years in patients who underwent curative resection varied from 20% to 63%, two year survival in those who underwent palliative resection varied from 7% to 32%, and median survival in those who underwent palliative diversion varied from one to eight months. The hazard rate ratios among individual surgeons, taking into account the identified risk factors, varied from 0.56 to 2.03, from 0.17 to 1.92, and from 0.57 to 1.50 for curative resection, palliative resection, and palliative diversion, respectively. CONCLUSION--There were significant variations in patient outcome among surgeons after surgery for colorectal cancer; such differences compromise survival. A considerable improvement in overall survival might be achieved if such surgery were undertaken by surgeons with a special interest in colorectal surgery or surgical oncology. \nCoronary occlusion following diagnostic angiography: salvage by intracoronary stenting. Catheter-induced coronary artery dissection and occlusion is a rare but serious complication of diagnostic cardiac angiography. This report describes the successful management of this complication with an intracoronary stent after prolonged balloon inflations and intracoronary thrombolytic therapy were unsuccessful. \nTrace elements and plasmapheresis. The relationship between serum aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) and plasmapheresis (PP) treatment was examined. Three patients with rheumatoid arthritis, six with myasthenia gravis, and 6 with multiple sclerosis were studied. Serum Al, Zn, Cu, and Fe were measured before and after PP. Plasma was separated by first filtration; a second filtration separated the plasma components. Three liters of plasma were treated in each PP session. With each PP treatment, total protein (TP) removed was 20 +/- 5% and serum albumin removed was +/- 6%. Serum Al rose significantly (p less than 0.01 from 1.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/dl pre-PP to 2.8 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl post-PP. Serum Zn, Cu, and Fe decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) from 86.2 +/- 7.4 micrograms/dl, 126 +/- 18 micrograms/dl, and 108 +/- 14 micrograms/dl pre-PP to 58.4 +/- 10.2 micrograms/dl, 104 +/- 6 micrograms/dl, and 82 +/- 16 micrograms/dl post-PP, respectively. Two days after the end of the six-month PP treatment, serum Al levels rose significantly (p less than 0.01), from 1.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/dl to 3.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl. However, serum TP, serum albumin, and serum Zn, Cu, and Fe did not change significantly. It thus appears essential in PP treated patients, to remove Al from the blood to protect against aluminum intoxication. \nAnalysis of the transition to percutaneous placement of Greenfield filters. To establish whether a transition from surgical to percutaneous placement of Greenfield filters was justified, a review of the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the two approaches was conducted. Between 1984 and 1989, 168 filters were placed in 169 patients, 48 surgically and 120 percutaneously. Placement was successful in 45 (94%) of the 48 surgical patients and 120 (99%) of the 121 percutaneous patients. Filter misplacement occurred in three (6%) surgical patients and no percutaneous patients. Clinically evident femoral vein thrombosis occurred in only four (5%) of the percutaneous patients, while inferior vena cava thrombosis occurred in three (3%) of the percutaneous patients. One pulmonary embolus occurred after percutaneous filter placement and resulted in death. The cost of percutaneous placement was 58% that of surgical placement. A retrospective review of the experience in our patient population indicates that safety, cost, and ease of insertion make the percutaneous approach the procedure of choice for Greenfield filter placement. \nChronic myeloid leukemia in a woman with Still's disease treated with 198Au synoviorthesis. A 32-year-old woman presented with chronic myeloid leukemia 20 years after 2 198Au synoviortheses to her knees for severe juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. She progressed to blast phase of her disease and died from complications of therapy. The literature on rheumatoid arthritis, its therapy, radioisotopes and leukemia is reviewed. \nK-edge digital subtraction arthrography of the painful hip prosthesis: a feasibility study. K-edge energy subtraction radiography is a method for detecting the presence of iodinated contrast material by subtracting two digital radiographs produced by X-ray beams with energies above and below the iodine K edge. We performed a feasibility study on the application of K-edge energy digital subtraction arthrography (KEDSA) to painful hip prostheses. During arthrography, loosening of the prosthesis is implied if contrast material is seen dissecting around the prosthesis, an often difficult detection task because of adjacent prosthesis metal or cement. In conventional arthrography a preliminary mask image is thus used from which films obtained after injection of iodinated contrast material are subtracted. Movement by the patient during this process may preclude subsequent subtraction. With KEDSA, since multiple image pairs may be obtained after the injection of contrast material, the problem of patient motion is virtually eliminated. A conventional X-ray tube operating between 55 and 65 kVp was alternately filtered by iodine and cerium filters to produce the KEDSA images. The apparatus was capable of producing a subtracted image within 3 sec. The technique was applied to phantoms and to six patients immediately after hip arthrography that had been positive for prosthesis loosening. Although of lower spatial resolution, the KEDSA images were, in all cases, positive for loosening in a pattern consistent with the conventional arthrographic images. KEDSA was shown to be successful in detecting extraarticular contrast material. During a single study, subtraction in various imaging planes as well as postexercise subtraction imaging can be accomplished-techniques not heretofore possible in routine subtraction arthrography. \nTwelve-lead electrocardiographic evaluation of ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and its correlation with acute reocclusion. The sensitivity of the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram and that of standard (limb-lead) monitoring for the detection of ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were compared in 115 patients. The purpose was to identify the electrocardiographic leads that provide the most sensitive indicators of coronary ischemia during percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty and to evaluate the \"ischemic fingerprint\" that is obtained with 12-lead electrocardiogram during balloon inflation as a predictor of abrupt reocclusion after successful percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty procedures. During balloon inflations of 30 seconds, ischemia was detected in 61 of 145 vessels (42%) by limb-lead monitoring alone versus 130 of 145 vessels (90%) by 12-lead electrocardiography (p less than or equal to 0.001). In the nine patients (7.8%) who experienced abrupt reocclusion within 24 hours, the electrocardiogram during chest pain after percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty was identical to that obtained during percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty (\"ischemic fingerprint\"). None of the six patients who had chest pain after percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty without evidence of abrupt reocclusion reproduced their ischemic fingerprint. The suggested optimal leads for monitoring ischemia are as follows: left anterior descending coronary artery, V2, and V3; circumflex artery, V2, and V3; and right coronary artery, III and aVF. \nAdenoma of type 2 pneumocytes with oncocytic features. An adenoma of type 2 pneumocytes in the periphery of the left lung was an incidental finding at the autopsy of a 28-year-old woman. Light microscopy revealed a predominantly papillary growth with oncocytic features. Ultrastructurally, multilaminated bodies and many mitochondria were found in the tumor cells and tubular myelin in the extracellular spaces. Immunohistochemistry revealed surfactant apoprotein in tumor cells and extracellularly. \nVasovagal asystole during spinal anaesthesia. A patient in whom vasovagal asystole was induced by the performance of a spinal anaesthetic in the upright position is described. This illustrates the importance of routine monitoring of the electrocardiograph during regional anaesthesia. The risk of vasovagal syncope may be increased by the use of the sitting position and by the omission of anxiolytic premedication. \nMotor initiation versus execution in normal and Parkinson's disease subjects. We studied motor initiation and execution using wrist extension movem",
