<TEXT><![CDATA[Amoxicillin is an antibiotic medication belonging to the aminopenicillin class of the penicillin family. The drug is used to treat bacterial infections[9] such as middle ear infection, strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, odontogenic infections, and urinary tract infections.[9] It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth), or less commonly by either Intramuscular injection or by an IV bolus injection, which is a relatively quick intravenous injection lasting from a couple of seconds to a few minutes.[9][10] Common adverse effects include nausea and rash.[9] It may also increase the risk of yeast infections and, when used in combination with clavulanic acid, diarrhea.[11] It should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin.[9] While usable in those with kidney problems, the dose may need to be decreased.[9] Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding does not appear to be harmful.[9] Amoxicillin is in the Î²-lactam family of antibiotics.[9] Amoxicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into medical use in 1972.[12][13] Amoxil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1974,[4][5] and in the United Kingdom in 1977.[2] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[14] It is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in children.[15] Amoxicillin is available as a generic medication.[9] In 2022, it was the 26th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 20 million prescriptions.[16][17]]]></TEXT>
