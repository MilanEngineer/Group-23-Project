        "text": "a non-Q-wave infarction. Patients with a non-Q-wave infarction will have a better preserved left ventricular function than patients who develop a Q-wave infarction. This suggests the need for equal distribution of such patients in randomized trials of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction to avoid misinterpreting data between groups. \nCardiac sources of embolism and cerebral infarction--clinical consequences and vascular concomitants: the Lausanne Stroke Registry. We studied clinical characteristics and coexisting causes of stroke in 305 patients admitted to a population-based primary care center with an initial ischemic stroke and a potential cardiac source of embolism (PCSE). Using systematic standardized cardiac, arterial, and cerebral investigations and the logistics of the prospective Lausanne Stroke Registry, we found that nonprogressive onset, hemianopia without hemiparesis or hemisensory disturbances, Wernicke's aphasia, ideomotor apraxia, involvement of specific territories (posterior division of middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, cerebellum, multiple territories), and a hemorrhagic component were associated with the presence of a PCSE, as compared with 1,006 initial ischemic stroke patients without PCSE. Although age and sex did not differ, the frequency of hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, elevated blood cholesterol, and deep hemispheric or brainstem infarcts was higher in the patients without a PCSE. Nearly one-fourth of the patients with a PCSE had a coexisting potential arterial cause of stroke (large artery greater than or equal to 50% stenosis or small-vessel disease). In the majority of patients with a PCSE (76.7%), cardioembolism was the most likely cause of stroke, although a direct source of embolism was uncommon (4.3%) and intracranial embolic occlusions were present in less than one-half of the patients who were angiographed. \nClinical factors affecting the immediate outcome of PTCA in patients with unstable angina and poor candidates for surgery. Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has been successfully applied in unstable angina to carefully selected patients. In this study, PTCA was performed in 277 consecutive patients suffering from unstable angina and for whom bypass surgery was not a valid alternative because either of inoperable conditions or of emergency, or because surgery was not the best option. All patients were admitted first to the intensive care unit where an attempt was made to control unstable angina under conventional medical therapy using at least iv nitroderivative, heparin, and calcium blockers. After a standardized preparation PTCA was performed either as an emergency procedure in medically refractory unstable angina (107 cases) or as an elective procedure in controlled situations after a 7 to 10 days symptom-free period. Three hundred fifty-three coronary vessels were attempted. Results of this group are compared with those of a control group made of 670 consecutive stable patients recruited during the same period, and clinical characteristics are envisaged as potential predictive factors. Unstable angina is undoubtedly associated with a higher overall complication rate, but the immediate outcome is strongly affected by the clinical context. As an example, respective success and mortality rates are: 93% and 0% when a full revascularization is attempted; 91% and 0% in elective procedures in patients under 60; 87% and 1.2% in elective PTCA for multiple vessel disease; 80% and 6.5% in emergency PTCA; 80% and 11% in the overall triple vessel disease; 84% and 16% in patients with deeply altered ejection fraction; and 58% and 26% in triple vessel disease with 2 previously occluded coronary arteries. \nDifferent types of chronic hepatitis in alcoholic patients: does chronic hepatitis induced by alcohol exist? To verify the existence of chronic hepatitis induced by alcohol, the clinicopathological features of chronic hepatitis in heavy drinkers were studied using various viral markers. Histological features of chronic active hepatitis were seen in 27 heavy drinkers. These patients were divided into four groups. The AL group (seven cases) consisted of alcoholics who were negative for both hepatitis C antibody and HBsAg; the HB group (four cases) was positive for HBsAg; the HC1 group (seven cases) was positive for hepatitis C antibody but negative for hepatitis C virus-RNA genome; and the HC2 group (nine cases) was positive both for hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C virus-RNA genome. Serum AST and ALT activity declined during 4 wk of abstinence in most patients in the AL group and in the HC1 group. The response of serum AST and ALT to abstinence was poor in most patients in the HB group and the HC2 group. Serum desialo-transferrin and alcohol liver membrane antibodies were detected more frequently in the sera of patients in the AL group and HC1 group. A trend toward increased frequency of centrilobular ballooning existed in the AL group, but this did not reach statistical significance. These results suggest that chronic active hepatitis in patients in the AL group, in whom markers of HBV and hepatitis C virus were absent, may be caused by alcohol. Patients in the HC1 group who had hepatitis C antibody but not hepatitis C virus-RNA may represent cases where both alcohol and hepatitis C virus are involved. \nClinical evaluation of stenosis of the carotid bifurcation with magnetic resonance angiographic techniques. We evaluated the images of 60 carotid artery bifurcations in 31 patients suspected to have carotid artery disease who underwent invasive carotid angiography and combined two-dimensional, phase-sensitive and a gradient-echo magnetic resonance angiography. The phase scans consisted of seven serial projections that were obtained at 20 degrees intervals (11.0 minutes) around the carotid bifurcation; the gradient-echo (GRASS) scans were composed of 11 axial images (2.4 minutes) acquired through the bifurcation. The two magnetic resonance angiographic techniques yielded complementary pieces of information and were used together to compare magnetic resonance angiography with invasive angiography. Comparison of magnetic resonance and invasive angiograms of the 60 carotid arteries shows that the sensitivity (86%) and specificity (92%) of the magnetic resonance angiographic techniques we used to diagnose clinically significant carotid stenosis approach but do not reach those of invasive angiography. \nRadionuclide assessment of infarct size and left ventricular function in clinical trials of thrombolysis. Mortality, left ventricular ejection fraction, and infarct size are important end points in evaluating the efficiency of thrombolytic treatment in clinical trials. Radionuclide assessment of ejection fraction and infarct size is safe, accurate, reproducible, and readily available. Its use in clinical trials supplements mortality data and allows meaningful results in trials with smaller patient numbers. Single photon emission computed tomography improves the detection and quantification of infarct size, and its use with new radiopharmaceuticals will assume an important role in future trials. For an 8-year period, these radionuclide techniques have been used in the Western Washington Thrombolysis Trials and have generally shown smaller infarct size and higher ejection fractions in patients receiving streptokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator. However, in the most recent trial there was no direct relation between these end points and the time between symptom onset and initiation of treatment. Future trials that direct efforts to treatment in the first hour after symptom onset should further clarify this observation. \nKlippel-Trenaunay syndrome: the risks and benefits of vascular interventions. Our experience with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), a rare congenital malformation, has increased considerably in recent years and now includes 144 patients (65 male and 79 female patients). Hemangioma was present in 137 patients (95.1%), varicosity in 110 (76.4%), and hypertrophy of the soft tissues or bones in 134 (93.1%). In most patients (71.5%) the disease involved one lower extremity. Diagnostic workup included roentgenogram to document limb length discrepancy, noninvasive arterial and venous evaluation, contrast venography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Most patients did well without treatment or with elastic compression only. Surgical treatment for the vascular malformation in KTS is rarely needed and it continues to be controversial. To evaluate the risks and benefits of vascular interventions, we examined in detail the clinical histories of nine patients who in the last decade underwent operation for a vascular malformation of the lower extremity. In seven patients we removed varicose veins or resected hemangioma of the lower extremity. Although none was cured, all five who underwent resection of varicose veins and one of the two patients who underwent resection of a hemangioma improved. Two additional patients, however, who underwent resection of varicose veins in another institution had worsening of the symptoms. In one patient we performed deep venous reconstruction for atresia of the superficial femoral vein, using the contralateral saphenous vein. Such operation in KTS has not been reported previously. The patient has a patent graft with a competent valve and clinical improvement 6 months after the operation. Although patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency, disturbing cosmetic appearance, or complications of hemangioma may benefit from surgical treatment, detailed preoperative imaging of the extremity and pelvis with magnetic resonance imaging and contrast venography is needed to decrease complications. Rarely, reconstruction for atresia or hypoplasia of the deep veins may be needed. \nDNA ploidy pattern of flat adenomas of the large bowel. In an attempt to clarify the nature of \"flat adenomas,\" DNA content was measured by means of microspectrophotometry. Thirty-nine flat adenomas (FA), 13 with mild, 22 with moderate, and 4 with severe atypia, were collected for this study. In FA, diploidy (D), polyploidy (P), and aneuploidy (A) were found 100, 0, and 0 percent in mild atypia, 41.9, 4.5, and 54.5 percent in moderate atypia, and 0, 0, and 100 percent in severe atypia, respectively. It is assumed that FA have a much higher malignancy potential than previously expected since, histologically, benign-appearing FA with moderate atypia have already contained malignant DNA patterns. In particular, those more than 5 mm in diameter show aneuploidy in 80 percent. These data suggest that FA with moderate atypia play an important role in the pathogenesis of small colonic carcinomas. \nFailure of MR imaging to detect reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities is a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. It is characterized by pain, hyperthermia, and cutaneous changes and has been linked to an abnormality of regional blood flow. The disease is associated with previous injury or trauma including surgery, but also has been found in association with myocardial infarctions and tumors. The final diagnosis can be made only on the basis of the clinical course, which is characterized either by regression without sequel or the appearance of aponeurotic and tendinous retractions including bony sclerosis in the affected region occurring over many months to years. The literature and our own results show that MR imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosing transient osteoporosis of the hip, which is generally thought to be a form of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Therefore we investigated the usefulness of MR imaging for diagnosing sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities. Twenty-five patients underwent T1- and T2-weighted MR imaging of the affected body region. They were selected on the basis of the initial clinical findings and positive findings on scintigraphy, which is known to be a sensitive, but not very specific, imaging method for sympathetic dystrophy. The final diagnosis was established on the basis of the clinical course in 17 of the 25 patients. In 10 of these, findings on MR images were completely normal, in six the MR images showed only nonspecific soft-tissue changes or bone marrow sclerosis, and in one patient they showed changes in bone marrow signal. Of the remaining eight patients without a final diagnosis of sympathetic dystrophy, MR showed soft-tissue or bone marrow alterations in six. MR imaging appears to be of little value in establishing the diagnosis of sympathetic dystrophy, but it may improve diagnostic specificity when used in conjunction with scintigraphy. \nHypertensives' pressor response to norepinephrine. Analysis by infusion rate and plasma levels. After 5 days of a 10 mEq sodium diet or 4 days of a 200 mEq sodium diet, 15 hypertensives and 11 normotensive control subjects received pressor doses of intravenous norepinephrine (NE). Analysis of pressor responses to the rate of NE infusion showed that the high salt diet sensitized subjects so that they needed less NE to raise systolic blood pressure (SBP) 20 mm Hg (P = .005). There was a complex interaction of salt intake, black race, and hypertension on NE pressor sensitivity (P = .03). Hypertensives attained lower plasma NE levels during the stepwise NE infusion, so we reanalyzed NE sensitivity in terms of the changes in plasma NE levels. This analysis also showed that during the high salt diet, subjects initiated a pressor response at lower plasma NE levels (P = .017) and raised SBP 20 mm Hg at lower NE levels (P = .007). The reanalysis showed that hypertensives initiated a pressor response at lower plasma NE levels (P = .03) and raised SBP 20 mm Hg at lower NE levels (P = .002). Plasma NE levels should provide a better guide to the concentration of NE at cardiovascular receptors than the rate of NE infusion. Analysis of pressor responses to plasma NE levels demonstrated that the hypertensives had an exaggerated pressor response to NE. \nChaos, balance, and development: thoughts on selected childhood epilepsy syndromes. Age-specific epilepsy syndromes raise important questions about developmental susceptibility to seizures and epileptogenesis and about the effect of seizures on function. The diagnosis and treatment of these syndromes has been enhanced by the use of modern science and technology. Epidemiologic studies have changed our approach to febrile convulsions. This developmental seizure disorder is benign and self-limited. We have been forced to think carefully about threshold, therapy, and whether other seizures in childhood may be equally benign. This framework of developmental specificity can also be applied to West syndrome, especially with respect to neurophysiology, neurochemistry, neuroimaging, and epidemiology--the types of seizures, clustering, variations associated with sleep, PET scans, and therapy. Rasmussen's syndrome and other unilateral developmental epilepsies are progressive but remain confined to a single hemisphere. However, they usually are devastating to global neurologic function. They are models for examining the impact of epilepsy in one pathologic hemisphere on the function of the entire brain. Current therapy for this condition is hemispherectomy. Recovery of function after this major surgery is striking and provides clues to brain organization. The analysis of these three syndromes provides windows on the dynamic, changing central nervous system of the child and may lead to better understanding and therapy for other seizure disorders. \nClassification of epilepsies and epileptic syndromes in two different samples of patients. We attempted to classify, according to the International Classification of Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes, 986 patients consecutively examined during a 13-month period either in a specialized private practice (n = 642) or in an adult neurology unit in a university hospital (n = 344). Without major difficulty, we classified 97% of patients in more or less clearly defined syndromes. Benign frontal and benign psychomotor epilepsies of childhood were represented in this sample of patients. In either partial or generalized idiopathic epilepsies, a diagnosis of epilepsy appears justified even after a single epileptic event when sufficient electroclinical characteristics are present. Patients with symptomatic generalized epilepsies often have to be classified under two or three headings. Many children with a symptomatic generalized epilepsy also experience partial seizures. Alcoholic epilepsy is described as a veritable epileptic syndrome. The distribution of epileptic syndromes was clearly different in the two samples, casting doubt on the value of some epidemiologic surveys based on selected groups of patients. \nFactors influencing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease in childhood. We have reviewed the outcome of all patients undergoing their first intestinal resection for Crohn's disease at this hospital between 1970 and 1987. Recurrence rates, defined by recurrent intestinal symptoms and radiological confirmation of mucosal disease, were calculated using survival analysis. Age, sex, anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, preoperative duration of symptomatic disease, use of preoperative bowel rest, and pathological features of the resected bowel were analysed individually and jointly as potential risk factors influencing postoperative recurrence of disease. Eighty two patients (age, mean (SD) 14.8 (2.5) years) underwent intestinal resection and were followed postoperatively for a minimum of one year (mean 5.3 (3.3) years). Anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, and preoperative duration of symptomatic disease were the only factors that significantly influenced the duration of the recurrence free interval. Patients with diffuse ileocolonic inflammation experienced earlier recurrence (50% at one year) than children with predominantly small bowel disease (50% recurrence at five years, p less than 0.0001). Failure of medical therapy independent of disease location as the sole indication for surgery was associated with an earlier relapse than when surgery was performed for a specific intestinal complication such as abscess or obstruction (p less than 0.003). Patients undergoing resection within one year of onset of symptoms experienced delayed recrudescence of active disease (30% recurrence by eight years) compared with patients whose preoperative duration of symptomatic disease was longer (50% recurrence by four years when preoperative duration of disease was one to four years and 50% by three years when disease had been present greater than four years preoperatively, p = 0.03). \nClinical follow-up and progression of carotid atherosclerosis determined by duplex scanning in patients suffering from TIA. We investigated the clinical outcomes and the progression of the internal carotid arterial lesions of a group of patients presenting with hemispheric TIAs. The cumulative frequency of TIAs during a mean follow-up period of 40 +/- 14 months was 14%, and no relationship was found between new TIAs and the presence of known cardiovascular risk factors or plaque characteristics as determined by duplex scanning. With the exception of one patient who died of stroke, none of the patients developed a permanent neurologic deficit. The cumulative death rate was 6.5%; myocardial infarction was the most common cause (3 out of 7). Anatomic progression of plaques was determined by duplex scanning in 22% of the internal carotid arteries. No relationship between progression of these plaques and the development of new TIAs was evident. We conclude that, in this group of patients, TIAs do not inevitably lead to stroke and that TIAs are not predictable based on risk factors or plaques characteristics. \nProopiomelanocortin gene expression in normal and tumoral human lung. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression is not restricted to the pituitary corticotroph cell, but also takes place in many normal and tumoral nonpituitary tissues. In contrast, the ectopic ACTH syndrome is a rare event. Because it is most often associated with lung tumors, we specifically studied this tissue, analyzing the different forms of POMC RNAs in normal specimens as well as in various types of tumors. The endocrine nature of the tumors was assessed by both histological examination and measurements of secretogranin-I fragments in the tissue extracts. POMC RNA was first detected by Northern blot analysis; its absolute amounts and its various molecular forms were more precisely quantified and discriminated by S1 mapping studies using a single stranded DNA probe located at the 5' end of exon 3. In five bronchial carcinoid tumors associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome, a highly predominant, if not single, POMC RNA identical to the 1200-nucleotide (nt) pituitary message was present, the high amounts of which were correlated with those of POMC peptides in the same tissues. In five bronchial carcinoid tumors not associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome, the same message was detected (four of five), with a second, often predominant, short RNA of about 800 nt (five of five), and the overall amounts of POMC RNAs were low. Similar patterns of POMC RNAs were observed in squamous cell tumors, adenocarcinomas, and normal lung, where the short 800-nt RNA tended to be predominant. These results show that POMC gene expression can be demonstrated in normal lung tissue and in all types of lung tumors. The ectopic ACTH syndrome only occurs with tumors capable of generating high amounts of the pituitary-like message, a phenomenon that seems to be restricted to an occasional tumor with features of neuroendocrine differentiation. \nAutoantibody-encoding kappa L chain genes frequently rearranged in lambda L chain-expressing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients with kappa L chain expressing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) frequently have leukemia cells reactive with a murine mAb, designated 17.109. Raised against a monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor autoantibody, this mAb recognizes a major kappa-L chain-associated cross reactive Id, designated 17.109-CRI. Molecular studies reveal that the 17.109-CRI in CLL is a serologic marker for expression of a conserved kappa L chain V region gene (V Kappa gene) of the V Kappa 3 subgroup, designated Humkv325. We isolated an upstream gene fragment of Humkv325 to examine for Ig gene rearrangements of this and other closely related V Kappa 3 genes by Southern analyses. Consistent with Humkv325 encoding the 17.109-CRI, we find that the genomic DNA from all 17.109-reactive leukemia cell populations have gene rearrangements that are detected using this probe. In addition, we observe V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements frequently in the genomic DNA of lambda L chain-expressing leukemia cells. Of the genomic DNA from 33 lambda-L chain-expressing CLL samples, 8 (24%) had additional nongerm-line bands detected with the Humkv325 probe. Consistent with these bands representing Ig gene rearrangements, the additional band in each but one sample also hybridized with probes specific for the J Kappa region and/or the kappa-deleting element. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we examined the genomic DNA from all lambda L chain-expressing CLL for V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements to J Kappa and/or Kde. PCR on each DNA sample with V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements detected by Southern analysis generated gene fragments that hybridized specifically with oligonucleotides corresponding to framework or CDR of the Humkv325 gene. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of representative samples confirmed that these DNA contained abortive Humkv325 gene rearrangements. PCR for rearranged V Kappa 3 genes in the DNA of other lambda-L chain-expressing CLL either did not generate any PCR product or produced fragments that failed to hybridize with all Humkv325 oligonucleotide probes. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of the latter demonstrated that these represent abortive V Kappa gene rearrangements involving another conserved V Kappa 3 gene, designated Vg. These studies indicate that Humkv325 and Vg frequently may undergo Ig gene rearrangement independent of their expression. As such, the frequent use of Humkv325 in CLL may be secondary, in part, to an enhanced propensity of this V Kappa 3 gene to undergo genetic rearrangement during B cell ontogeny. \nRelationship between redistribution on exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy and repetitive ventricular premature beats in patients with recent myocardial infarction. The relationship between myocardial ischemia detected by exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy and repetitive ventricular premature beats (VPBs) during ambulatory monitoring was evaluated in 57 patients with recent myocardial infarction. Multivariate analysis was performed to obtain the relatively important factor related to repetitive VPBs with the use of the following variables: age, redistribution, left ventricular ejection fraction, serum potassium and magnesium concentration, QRS score, left ventricular aneurysm, and the number of diseased vessels. Thirty-five patients had redistribution, but only three of them had repetitive VPBs during exercise testing. The average heart rate before 79% of 398 episodes of repetitive VPBs during ambulatory monitoring was in the range of 56 to 70/min. These data indicate that most of repetitive VPBs during ambulatory monitoring were not provoked by exercise-induced acute myocardial ischemia. However, redistribution was found to be an important factor associated with repetitive VPBs. The electrical abnormality relating to a substrate characterized by chronic reversible ischemia may explain the association between redistribution and repetitive VPBs. \nPrediction of subclinical tumor infiltration in basal cell carcinoma. Two thousand-sixteen basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) were documented in terms of age, anatomic location, tumor diameter, initial excision depth, safety margin, histologic type, and the position of tumor outgrowths as determined by three-dimensional histologic study of the tumor margins in paraffin sections (micrographic surgery). The extent of each subsequent excision was recorded until tumor-free tissue was reached. The results showed that BCCs have a highly irregular infiltration pattern and a predilection for small, fingerlike outgrowths whose bases occupy 1-30 degrees of the tumor circumference. When superficial extension was expressed mathematically, the resulting exponential functions varied highly significantly (P = .001) according to histologic tumor type and diameter. The resulting curves permitted very precise prediction of the probability of tumor-positive margins (ie, subtotal excision), depending on the safety margin, histologic tumor type, and tumor diameter. For example, the probability of tumor-positive margins after excision of a BCC up to 10 mm in diameter is 30% with a safety margin of 2 mm, 16% with a safety margin of 3 mm, and 5% with a safety margin of 5 mm. The probability of tumor-positive margins for fibrosing primary BCCs 10-20 mm in diameter is 48, 34, and 18% with safety margins of 2, 3, and 5 mm, respectively. Recurrent tumors have a significantly higher probability of positive margins (P = .001) than primary ones. Anatomic location and tumor age affect subclinical extension only indirectly. \nEffect of antitumor surgery on soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels. Surgically induced immunosuppression may play a role in cancer, because of the possible existence of micrometastases at the time of surgical removal of tumors. Antitumor immune reactions are mediated by interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 acts on a specific IL-2 cell surface receptor; moreover, a soluble form of IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) can be released in the blood. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of surgery on sIL-2R serum levels in patients with operable solid tumors. A total of 48 patients with cancer and 11 controls who underwent major surgery for non-neoplastic disease were evaluated before and 7 days after surgery. Serum mean levels of sIL-2R were significantly higher after than before surgery in both the cancer and control groups. No correlation was seen between surgery-induced changes in sIL-2R and in T lymphocyte subsets. Because of its capacity of binding to IL-2, the increased blood concentrations of sIL-2R could reduce the IL-2 availability and negatively affect antitumor immune reactions. \nMaternal reproductive history and birth characteristics in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using birth-registration data, a case-control study was done to investigate the possible associations of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with birth characteristics and maternal reproductive history. The data included cases born and diagnosed in Minnesota since 1969. Matched analyses were conducted using 337 cases and 1336 birth year-matched controls. There was a statistically significant increased odds of ALL for birth to older (greater than 35 years) mothers (odds ratio (OR) = 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28, 3.58), older fathers (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.14, 2.30), mothers with at least a high school education (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.05, 2.48), and larger intervals (greater than 5 years) between the birth of the proband and the preceding sibling (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.12, 3.09). The increased odds of ALL for birth by Caesarean section approached significance (OR = 1.42, P = 0.06). No overall association was found for: gender, race, paternal education, fetal-loss history, birth order, prenatal care history, pregnancy complications, inducement of labor, multiple birth, gestational age, or birth weight. Age at diagnosis was an important effect modifier of some analyses. For cases diagnosed before age 2 years, there was a 2.7-fold increased odds of ALL if the last pregnancy had resulted in a fetal loss (P = 0.03). For cases diagnosed before age 4 years, birth weight greater than 3800 g was associated with a significant 2.05-fold increased odds of ALL. These data strengthen the hypothesis that prenatal events may play a causative role in childhood ALL, particularly in those cases diagnosed at a younger age. \nLaser uvulopalatoplasty in treatment of habitual snoring. Velopharyngeal sonorous snoring is best treated with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). To reduce surgical risks and minimize the morbidity, a simplified carbon dioxide laser uvulopalatoplasty (LUPP) was performed under local anesthesia. Among a total of 146 patients who had a LUPP performed, there was no significant bleeding or postoperative episodes of asphyxia. The procedure was well tolerated even by those patients with strong vomiting reflexes. The operation time was halved, as was the convalescence. Two patients (1.4%) developed scarring with nasal obstruction, but the impact of factors other than the laser approach itself seemed to be the cause. By scored questionnaires the effect on snoring, family complaints, and daytime somnolence was evaluated in two comparable random groups of patients. Sixty-three patients had LUPP procedures, and 37 had UPPP. The short-term results showed that about 90% of the patients considered themselves essentially improved as regarded snoring and that most patients felt more alert, irrespective of the surgical method used. \nCerebral granular cell tumor occurring with glioblastoma multiforme: case report. A 65-year-old man presented with 4 weeks of partial right visual field loss. A left occipital granular cell tumor was diagnosed via open biopsy. No specific tumoricidal therapy was given, and the patient returned 2 weeks later with fluent dysphasia and mild right hemiparesis, and formed visual hallucinations. A large left parietotemporal mass, separate from the granular cell tumor, was diagnosed as a glioblastoma multiforme by stereotactic biopsy. The histogenesis of cerebral granular cell tumors is controversial; this case supports recent speculation of their possible glial origin. \nThe parietal cell autoantibodies recognized in neonatal thymectomy-induced murine gastritis are the alpha and beta subunits of the gastric proton pump. Murine autoimmune gastritis, induced by neonatal thymectomy, bears a striking similarity in pathology to the human autoimmune disease, pernicious anemia. Autoantibodies to parietal cells are found in both murine and human diseases. Monoclonal immunoglobulin G autoantibodies, obtained from neonatally thymectomized mice, have previously been shown to recognize two groups of gastric parietal cell antigens. In the present study, it is shown that two of these monoclonal autoantibodies, designated 1H9 and 2B6, are directed against the alpha subunit and beta subunit, respectively, of the gastric hydrogen-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (H+,K(+)-ATPase; proton pump). Monoclonal antibody 1H9 showed reactivity by immunoblotting with a 95-kilodalton component of dog gastric tubulovesicular membranes and with a fusion protein containing the hydrophilic domain of the alpha subunit of the H+,K(+)-ATPase. Monoclonal antibody 2B6 reacted by immunoblotting with the 60-90-kilodalton glycoprotein (beta subunit) of the tomato lectin-purified dog H+,K(+)-ATPase and with the 60-90-kilodalton autoantigen purified with human parietal cell autoantibodies. Monoclonal antibody 2B6 also reacted with the deglycosylated 35-kilodalton core protein of the tomato lectin-purified 60-90-kilodalton beta subunit and of the purified 60-90-kilodalton autoantigen. Parietal cell autoantibody-positive sera from 20 mice with experimentally induced gastritis showed reactivity predominantly with the alpha and/or beta subunit of the gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase. Therefore, it is concluded that the major molecules targeted by parietal cell autoantibodies from mice with neonatal thymectomy-induced murine autoimmune gastritis and from humans with pernicious anemia are identical. \nImmunohistochemical staining of CA 50 antigen in human bladder cancer. Relation to histologic grade, clinical stage, and prognosis. The immunohistochemical detection of tumor marker CA 50 was studied in bladder cancer of WHO grades I-III. The material consisted of tumors in 83 patients and the mean clinical follow-up time was thirteen years (range 9.6-22 years). The fraction of CA 50-positive cells (FPtot) in microscopic image was scored 0-100 percent. Also the maximally staining region was selected, and the fraction of CA 50-positive cells in this region was scored 0-100 percent (FPmax). The average staining intensity of CA 50-positive cells was scored from 0 to 3 in the whole section (ASItot) and in the maximally staining area (ASImax). The inverse relation between histologic grade, FPtot (p = 0.0001), and ASItot (p = 0.006) was statistically significant. FPtot (p = 0.039) and ASItot (p = 0.018) were also inversely related to clinical stage. Occurrence of metastasis during the follow-up was associated with low CA 50 positivity (FPtot, p = 0.003; ASItot, p = 0.002). The lower the staining intensity or the lower the fraction of CA 50-positive cells, the more aggressive was the tumor. In survival analysis, low FPtot (p = 0.002) and ASItot (p = 0.007) values were related to high risk of bladder cancer death. The results show that immunohistochemical staining of bladder tumor specimens with CA 50 can be used to predict bladder cancer aggressiveness and survival. \nThe bottom end. Handling of the perineal wound after abdominoperineal resection. There are a number of options for handling the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection, including open packing or primary closure with suction drainage. Open packing has not been widely accepted, fearing that it may delay perineal wound healing. The purpose of this paper, therefore, was to retrospectively evaluate, the experience at Ferguson Hospital with abdominoperineal resection from 1977 through 1986. The study population consisted of 288 patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma. Forty-six patients had the perineal wound closed primarily and 242 had the perineal wound packed open. Ninety-four patients had the pelvic peritoneum left open and 194 underwent closure of the pelvic peritoneum. Overall operative mortality was 2.1 per cent, and there was no significant difference between primary closure and open packing of the perineal wound with respect to hospital stay, operating time, operative blood loss, perioperative mortality, incidence of postoperative bowel obstruction, incidence of postoperative complications, or average time for perineal wound healing. Therefore, it would appear that packing the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection is a viable means of handling the bottom end. \nPotential role of PFOB enhanced sonography of the kidney. II. Detection of partial infarction. Aside from its ability to assess flow velocity within vessels, color Doppler and gray-scale sonography cannot distinguish perfused from non-perfused tissues. In this study we evaluated whether Perfluorooctylbromide (PFOB), a sonographic contrast agent given i.v., could aid sonography with this recognition. Partial renal infarction was produced by a 1 mm bead embolized in the right, the left, or both renal arteries of 20 normal rabbits. The sonographer, unaware of rabbit assignment, attempted to diagnose the infarct 24 hours later. All 20 rabbits were studied with gray-scale and color Doppler sonography, 10 before and after PFOB and 10 only after PFOB. Angiography and post-mortem examination were done for confirmation. Of the 20 kidneys evaluated before PFOB, the sonographer was unable to diagnose the 10 partial infarctions. Color Doppler identified five of the ten infarcted kidneys, but accurately localized the infarction in only two. Of the 40 kidneys evaluated after PFOB infusion, 20 scanned before and 20 scanned only after PFOB, all 20 partial infarctions were accurately diagnosed with both gray-scale and color Doppler. PFOB enhanced the echogenicity of perfused renal tissue allowing the easy detection of the unenhanced infarct. Because of the increased signal from vessels after PFOB, color Doppler displayed the entire vascular tree, allowing the detection of the truncated embolized branch. The ability of PFOB to enhance Doppler signals and the echogenicity of perfused tissues improved the diagnostic accuracy of sonography when used to detect partial renal infarctions. \nSarcoid neuropathy. In a case of subacute sensory and motor polyneuropathy associated with sarcoidosis, multiple epineurial and endoneurial granulomas were demonstrated in a sural nerve. Neighbouring nerve fibres were displaced by the granulomas and some were undergoing axonal degeneration. Ultrastructural and teased fibre studies showed axonal atrophy and degeneration with secondary demyelination. Histochemical studies indicated the presence of HLA-DR antigen on epithelioid cells in the granulomas. A non-specific inflammatory process in the nerve does not cause significant primary demyelination. \nMeasurement of in vivo urological tumour cell kinetics using multiparameter flow cytometry. Preliminary study. The in vivo labelling of urological tumour cells using the S phase marker bromodeoxyuridine (BRdU) for histochemical studies is reported. The use of multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) with BRdU labelling to study tumour proliferation offers significant advantages. It provides simultaneous measurements of the DNA ploidy (DI), the duration of the S phase (Ts), the potential doubling time (Tpot) and the total and aneuploid tumour labelling indices (LI) from a single specimen. Heterogenous tumour cell populations can be measured with high sensitivity. We report a preliminary study to evaluate the method in the measurement of the kinetics of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCCB). Nineteen patients with TCCB, 1 with leukoplakia of the bladder, 2 with renal carcinoma, 1 with prostatic carcinoma and 1 with a squamous carcinoma of the penis were studied. Of the bladder tumours, 3 were aneuploid, DI = 1.32, 1.58 and 1.89. BRdU uptake was detected in all tumours. The median LI was 1.5% (range 0.5-10.0). In 15/19 tumours the labelling profile was satisfactory for calculation of the Ts and Tpot. The median Ts was 6.2 h and the median Tpot was 17.1 days. This study demonstrates that measurement of multiple parameters of urological tumour proliferation in vivo is possible. These parameters require further assessment as indices of biological aggressiveness and clinical prognosis. \nFate of patients with acute myocardial infarction with patency of the infarct-related vessel achieved with successful thrombolysis versus rescue angioplasty. Patients with failure of infarct-related artery recanalization after thrombolytic therapy have a poor clinical outcome. These patients have been considered for rescue angioplasty 90 min after thrombolytic therapy at the time of emergency catheterization in the course of five Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials. The outcome of 776 patients with patent infarct-related vessels after emergency catheterization was analyzed--607 with thrombolysis-mediated patency of the infarct-related vessel and 169 with patency achieved by angioplasty. Baseline characteristics of the thrombolysis and angioplasty patency groups were similar except for a higher acute left ventricular ejection fraction (51.3% versus 48.2%) in the thrombolysis group (p = 0.003). Seven to 10 day left ventricular ejection fraction was higher (52.3% versus 48.1%), infarct zone functional recovery was greater (0.44 versus 0.21 standard deviation/chord, or 18% versus 7%, p = 0.001) and reocclusion was less (11% versus 21%) in the thrombolysis compared with the angioplasty group. Despite these differences, angioplasty patency was associated with the same low in-hospital mortality rate (5.9% versus 4.6%) and long-term mortality rate (3% versus 2%) as thrombolysis patency. Reocclusion adversely affected the mortality rate and ventricular functional recovery. Technical failure of rescue angioplasty was associated with a much higher mortality rate than was technical success (39.1% versus 5.9%). Thrombolysis patency was preferable to angioplasty patency after thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction, but both were associated with the same low in-hospital and long-term mortality rates, suggesting that rescue angioplasty is beneficial in some patients with failure of infarct-related artery recanalization after thrombolytic therapy. \nCerebral ischemic events associated with endocarditis, retinal vascular disease, and lupus anticoagulant. PURPOSE: A group of young patients presenting with cerebral ischemic events, endocardial lesions, and lupus anticoagulant is described in order to highlight the common clinical laboratory features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients (10 females, age range 17 to 53 years [mean 38 years]) at onset of symptoms of cerebral ischemia who had evidence of the lupus anticoagulant syndrome and were being followed prospectively are reviewed. All patients had abnormal phospholipid-dependent coagulation test results, and most had anticardiolipin antibody at the time of presentation. Three of 14 had four or more American Rheumatism Association criteria for definite systemic lupus erythematosus and the remaining patients were considered to have primary lupus anticoagulant syndrome. RESULTS: The common features among these patients included at least one cerebral ischemic event at presentation (stroke or transient ischemic attack), or recurrent episodes suggesting cerebral ischemia (amaurosis fugax, recurrent severe migraine headaches), livedo reticularis, endocardial valvular lesions noted on echocardiography (11 mitral, two aortic valve) that were often associated with discrete vegetations, retinal vascular lesions, and computed tomographic/magnetic resonance imaging scanning or angiographic evidence of multiple cerebral infarction. Venous thromboembolic events were uncommon (three of 14). Common laboratory studies included thrombocytopenia (10 of 14), positive direct Coombs' test result (11 of 14), and hypocomplementemia (11 of 14). Follow-up after initial treatment with either salicylates or anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) for up to 10 years indicated that while many patients had recurrent symptoms suggesting cerebral ischemia, major stroke syndromes did not recur nor new episodes emerge. CONCLUSION: The combination of multiple cerebral ischemic lesions and endocardial lesions, including valvular vegetations, suggests that these cerebral ischemic events represent cerebral emboli, and that these cerebral embolic events originate from vegetative lesions on the mitral or, less commonly, aortic valve, in association with lupus anticoagulant. \nAdmission alcohol level: a predictor of the course of alcohol withdrawal. BACKGROUND. Little is known about how to predict the course of alcohol withdrawal. This study explores relationships between alcohol levels at admission to a detoxification unit and the severity and outcome of alcohol withdrawal. METHODS. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in two institutions, the Mid-Missouri Mental Health Center (MMMHC) and the Harry S Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital (HSTMVH), of individuals admitted during 1 year. RESULTS. The alcohol levels at admission of the 86 clients at the Mental Health Center and the 99 patients at the HSTMVH, correlated with withdrawal severity over the first 48 hours after admission (R2 = .26 at MMMHC, .41 at HSTMVH, P less than .0001 for both), and remained significantly associated even after adjustment for other variables. Furthermore, individuals who had lower alcohol levels at the time of admission were more likely to stay for rehabilitation following detoxification (P less than .001 for both institutions). CONCLUSIONS. A patient's alcohol level at the time of admission to a detoxification unit may help predict the severity of withdrawal and the treatment outcome. \nElectrode system influence on biphasic waveform defibrillation efficacy in humans. BACKGROUND. Several clinical studies have demonstrated a general superiority of biphasic waveform defibrillation compared with monophasic waveform defibrillation using epicardial lead systems. To test the breadth of utility of biphasic waveforms in humans, a prospective, randomized evaluation of defibrillation efficacy of monophasic and single capacitor biphasic waveform pulses was performed for two distinct nonthoracotomy lead systems as well as for an epicardial electrode system in 51 cardiac arrest survivors undergoing automatic defibrillator implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS. The configurations tested consisted of a right ventricular-left ventricular (RV-LV) epicardial patch-patch system, an RV catheter-chest patch (CP) nonthoracotomy system, and a coronary sinus (CS) catheter-RV catheter nonthoracotomy system. For each configuration, the defibrillation current and voltage waveforms were recorded via a digital oscilloscope to measure defibrillation threshold voltage, current, resistance, and stored energy. Biphasic waveform defibrillation proved more efficient than monophasic waveform defibrillation for the epicardial RV-LV system (4.8 +/- 4.1 versus 6.7 +/- 4.9 J, p = 0.047) and the nonthoracotomy RV-CP system (23.4 +/- 11.1 versus 34.3 +/- 10.4 J, p = 0.0042). Biphasic waveform defibrillation thresholds were not significantly lower than monophasic waveform defibrillation thresholds for the CS-RV nonthoracotomy system (15.6 +/- 7.2 versus 20.0 +/- 11.5 J, p = 0.11). Biphasic waveform defibrillation proved more efficacious than monophasic waveform defibrillation in 13 of 20 patients (65%) with RV-LV epicardial patches, 10 of 15 patients (67%) with an RV-CP nonthoracotomy system, and nine of 16 patients (56%) with an RV-CS nonthoracotomy system. CONCLUSIONS. Biphasic pulsing was useful with nonthoracotomy lead systems as well as with epicardial lead systems. However, the degree of biphasic waveform defibrillation superiority appeared to be electrode system dependent. Furthermore, for a few individuals, biphasic waveform defibrillation proved less efficient than monophasic waveform defibrillation, regardless of the lead system used. \nGuillain-Barre syndrome associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection in Zimbabwe. We studied the clinical features and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology of 32 consecutive adults with inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (IDP) admitted to the teaching hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe. Twenty-nine of the IDP patients had Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and the other three had chronic IDP. Sixteen of 29 (55%) GBS patients were HIV-seropositive, a higher frequency of HIV infection than in blood donors drawn from the population served by these hospitals. All three chronic IDP patients were HIV-seronegative. In all HIV-seropositive patients, GBS was the initial illness that brought the patient to medical attention and led to the diagnosis of HIV infection. Compared with seronegative patients, the HIV-seropositive GBS patients were more likely to have generalized lymphadenopathy, CSF pleocytosis, coexistent CNS disturbance, and prior sexually transmitted disease. GBS in this region of Africa is frequently associated with HIV infection. \nComposition of atherosclerotic plaques in the four major epicardial coronary arteries in patients greater than or equal to 90 years of age. The composition of atherosclerotic plaques in 733 five-mm segments of the 4 major (left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex and right) epicardial coronary arteries of 18 patients greater than or equal to 90 years of age was determined by computerized planimetric analysis. By analysis of all coronary segments of all patients greater than 90, the plaques consisted primarily of fibrous tissue (87 +/- 8%) with calcific deposits (7 +/- 6%), pultaceous debris (5 +/- 4%) and foam cells (1 +/- 1%) occupying a much smaller percentage of plaque area. Analysis of composition according to the 4 degrees of luminal cross-sectional area narrowing revealed marked step-wise increases in pultaceous debris (from 0 +/- 0% at 0 to 25% narrowing to 18 +/- 22% at 76 to 100% narrowing, p = 0.0001) and calcific deposits (from 0 +/- 0 to 10 +/- 15%, p = 0.002), and decreases in fibrous tissue (from 99 +/- 3 to 71 +/- 23%, p = 0.0001) and area occupied by the media (from 35 +/- 8 to 16 +/- 8%, p = 0.0001). When the analysis was restricted to sections narrowed greater than 75%, no significant differences were found in plaque components or medial area between patients with (11 patients) and without (7 patients) myocardial infarcts at necropsy. \nMortality among petrochemical science and engineering employees. This is a study of a dynamic cohort of 13 250 commercial research and development personnel for whom information on occupational and educational background and smoking was available. Their age-, sex-, race-, and period-adjusted death rates were compared with New Jersey rates and with an internal comparison population. The overall results were favorable. The study groups had significantly fewer deaths from most major disease categories compared with other New Jersey residents. Among white male scientists and engineers, age-adjusted overall mortality and ischemic heart disease mortality were comparable to white male managers and support staff studied, whereas mortality from leukemia and lymphatic cancer was significantly elevated. Mechanics, however, had a significantly lower leukemia and lymphatic cancer mortality rate than did the comparison group. In a Poisson regression model in which white males and females from the study population were used, and for which the effects of age, smoking, college education category, period of hire, and years employed were controlled, scientists, engineers, and research technicians had elevated (nonsignificantly) mortality rates for leukemia and lymphatic cancer compared with managers and support staff. Smoking was an independent risk factor for leukemia and lymphatic cancer. Further work is needed to assess if specific environmental factors, such as benzene, other aromatics, radiation, medical treatment, and smoking habits, might have contributed to the above findings. \nExtracolonic manifestations of the familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. The classic prototypes of the gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes are familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome. Extracolonic manifestations have been described in both diseases, and the distinction between them has become less clear. In fact, some authorities have suggested that familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome may represent a spectrum of the same disease. In both conditions, extracolonic expressions are the rule rather than the exception, and familiarity with them is essential for accurate diagnosis and correct patient management. In this pictorial essay, we discuss familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome together under the heading familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. The colonic characteristics of these syndromes will be reviewed briefly, followed by examples of the most common extracolonic manifestations. \nElectrophysiological improvement following decompression surgery in tarsal tunnel syndrome. Plantar nerve conduction studies 14 months to 3.5 years after decompression surgery in 3 cases of tarsal tunnel syndrome showed an improvement in motor conduction as well as in sensory nerve conduction. This electrophysiological improvement was associated with clinical improvement. However, minor abnormalities still existed in sensory nerve conduction in all 3 cases. \nSWIFT trial of delayed elective intervention v conservative treatment after thrombolysis with anistreplase in acute myocardial infarction. SWIFT (Should We Intervene Following Thrombolysis?) Trial Study Group. OBJECTIVE--To see whether early elective angiography with a view to coronary angioplasty or bypass grafting of a stenosed infarct related vessel would improve outcome in acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis with anistreplase. DESIGN--Randomised study of two treatment strategies with analysis of results over 12 months. SETTING--21 district hospitals and regional cardiac centres in Britain and Ireland. SUBJECTS--800 of 993 patients presenting with clinical and electrocardiographic features of acute myocardial infarction up to three hours after the onset of major symptoms. TREATMENT STRATEGIES--Intravenous anistreplase 30 units followed by a standard regimen of heparin, warfarin, and timolol and (in patients so randomised) early angiography plus appropriate intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death or reinfarction within 12 months. RESULTS--397 patients were randomised to receive early angiography plus appropriate intervention (coronary angioplasty in 169 cases, coronary grafting in 59) and 403 patients to receive conservative care (of these, 12 had angioplasty and seven bypass grafting during the initial admission). By 12 months mortality (5.8% (23 patients) in the intervention group v 5.0% (20) in the conservative care group; p = 0.6) and rates of reinfarction (15.1% (60 patients) v 12.9% (52); p = 0.4) were similar in the two groups. No significant differences in rates of angina or rest pain were found at 12 months. Left ventricular ejection fraction at three and 12 months was the same in both groups. Median hospital stay was longer in the intervention group (11 days v 10 days; p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION--For most patients given thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction a strategy of angiography and intervention is appropriate only when required for clinical indications. \nCalcium for resuscitation? Calcium ions are essential for myocardial excitation-contraction coupling and for increasing contractility of the heart. Because of these physiological effects, use of calcium has been recommended in the treatment of electromechanical dissociation, asystole and ventricular fibrillation. Recently, however, the use of calcium during cardiac arrest has come into dispute, as there are no controlled clinical trials supporting a favourable haemodynamic effect. It has rather been suggested that, in resuscitation, calcium may have detrimental effects. In order to evaluate the role of calcium in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, it is important to know the serum concentrations of calcium and the haemodynamic effects in this situation. Measurements in some patients with cardiac arrest have demonstrated that severe hypocalcaemia may not be uncommon. In these patients, calcium may augment myocardial contractility, decrease intracardiac filling pressures and increase mean arterial pressure. At present, the more or less established indications for use of calcium during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are in treating patients with proven hypocalcaemia, hyperkalaemia, calcium channel blocker overdose and, possibly, electromechanical dissociation combined with a wide QRS complex. There is no good evidence supporting the routine use of calcium in resuscitation. \nNatural course of Graves' disease after subtotal thyroidectomy and management of patients with postoperative thyroid dysfunction. The Natural course of Graves' disease after subtotal thyroidectomy was studied in 67 patients who had subtotal thyroidectomy for Graves' disease and did not receive any medical treatment for 8 to 12 years after surgery. Postoperative thyroid status was determined by serum free thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotropin (TSH) levels in the first period (1 year after surgery), second period (3.9 +/- 1.0 years), and third period (8.8 +/- 1.5 years). Serum thyroid stimulating antibody (TSAb) and TSH binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII) activities were also measured. A total of 53 patients (79%) changed thyroid status during the observation period. One year after surgery, 50 percent of euthyroid subjects developed abnormal thyroid function in the next period. Reversible latent hypothyroidism was the most common type of thyroid dysfunction seen in up to 46% of patients. Interestingly, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism that developed in the postoperative period were temporary disorders in most cases. Serum TSAb and TBII activities did not help predict the postoperative changes of thyroid status. Our study indicates that the instability of the thyroid function is common after subtotal thyroidectomy. \nPlasma prostanoids in neonates with pulmonary hypertension treated with conventional therapy and with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Thromboxane may be a mediator of pulmonary hypertension in the neonate. Acute thromboxane-mediated pulmonary hypertension has been described in sheep receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which raises concerns about a potential thromboxane-mediated exacerbation of pulmonary hypertension in human neonates with severe pulmonary hypertension who are treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We measured plasma levels of thromboxane, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in infants with pulmonary hypertension, some of whom were treated medically and some of whom were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Plasma levels of all three prostanoids were elevated in infants with pulmonary hypertension and decreased with time, whether the neonates were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or with medical management alone. In infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, we collected samples simultaneously from preoxygenator sites, postoxygenator sites, and umbilical artery catheter. We could demonstrate no significant difference in plasma prostanoid levels across the oxygenator. In two patients, plasma thromboxane and prostaglandin F2 alpha levels measured shortly after a platelet transfusion were distinctly higher in the umbilical artery catheter than in venous samples. \nMedian and ulnar neuropathy after streptokinase infusion. In a patient treated with intravenous streptokinase, inflammation developed at the infusion site followed by permanent ulnar and median neuropathy. Although adverse streptokinase infusion site reactions have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration, no other cases have been reported in the medical literature. We suggest that extravasated streptokinase may produce permanent ulnar and median neuropathy. \nKi-1-positive large cell lymphomas, a heterogenous group of neoplasms. Morphologic, immunophenotypic, genotypic, and clinical features of 24 cases. Clinical and pathologic features of 24 patients with large cell lymphomas that expressed the activation antigen Ki-1 are described. Phenotypic and/or genotypic studies characterized these neoplasms as T-cell (16 cases), B-cell (six cases), or null cell (two cases) type. Males predominantly were affected. Age of patients ranged from 19 to 73 years, with a bimodal distribution, with peaks in the third and seventh decades. Lymphadenopathy was present in nearly all patients. Extranodal involvement, including skin, soft tissue, bone, central nervous system, lung, or small intestine was observed in a total of 54% of the patients, either at presentation or during the course of disease. \"Prototypic\" features of large cell anaplastic lymphomas were observed for eight T-cell lymphomas, with morphologic heterogeneity noted for the remainder. Eight patients, all with T-cell neoplasms (only one with prototypic morphology), have died of lymphoma (median survival, 5 months). An antecedent history of a lymphoproliferative disorder (mycosis fungoides, B-cell lymphoma, immunoblastic lymphadenopathy) was apparent in seven patients. An 8-year history of Crohn's disease occurred in one patient with a T-cell lymphoma involving small intestine. Phenotypically, loss of one or more markers was typically noted for T-cell neoplasms. Leukocyte common antigen was detected in all cases, although partial loss of immunoreactivity was noticed in some cases. Nearly all cases evaluated for Ia antigen or alpha-1-antichymotrysin were reactive. Eleven of 16 T-cell, two of six B-cell, and two null cell lymphomas expressed epithelial membrane antigen. Ki-1-positive large cell lymphomas are characterized by clinical, morphologic, and immunophenotypic heterogeneity. \nIsoflurane anesthesia and myocardial ischemia: comparative risk versus sufentanil anesthesia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The SPI (Study of Perioperative Ischemia) Research Group. Whether isoflurane has the potential to produce coronary artery steal and associated myocardial ischemia is still controversial. Previous studies addressing this issue in humans did not purposefully control hemodynamics or use continuous measures of myocardial ischemia. The authors used transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and continuous Holter electrocardiography (ECG) to study the relative risk of myocardial ischemia during isoflurane or sufentanil anesthesia under strict control of hemodynamics in 186 high-risk patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Overall, hemodynamics were well controlled (increased heart rate = 9.8%; increased systolic blood pressure = 7.1%; decreased systolic blood pressure = 10.8% of total prebypass time compared with preoperative baseline values), with no difference between the two anesthetics. In the 162 patients with interpretable TEE recordings, moderate to severe TEE ischemic episodes (grade change greater than or equal to 2) developed in 33 (21%) during the prebypass period, with no difference between isoflurane (12 of 56 = 21%) and sufentanil (21 of 106 = 20%) (P = 0.97). The duration and severity of TEE episodes were not significantly different between the two groups. No correlation was observed between TEE ischemic episodes and isoflurane concentrations (range 0.47-1.75%). In the 181 patients with interpretable ECG recordings, ECG evidence of ischemia developed in 34 (19%) during the prebypass period, with no difference between isoflurane (12 of 59 = 20%) and sufentanil (22 of 122 = 18%) (P = 0.87). The duration and severity of electrocardiographic ischemic episodes were also similar in patients receiving either isoflurane or sufentanil. Four of the 62 patients (6%) who received isoflurane had an adverse cardiac outcome versus 15 of 124 patients (12%) who received sufentanil (P = 0.34). The authors' findings demonstrate that, when hemodynamics are controlled, the incidence of myocardial ischemia (TEE or ECG) during isoflurane and sufentanil anesthesia is similar. \nMultisystem failure and hepatic microvesicular fatty metamorphosis associated with tolmetin ingestion. Multisystem toxicity including both renal and hepatic failure has been reported with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We report a fatal case of multisystem failure associated with tolmetin ingestion in a 15-year-old girl. Microvesicular fatty change was found in the liver at autopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated multisystem failure to have this histopathologic finding. \nEffect of antitumor surgery on soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels. Surgically induced immunosuppression may play a role in cancer, because of the possible existence of micrometastases at the time of surgical removal of tumors. Antitumor immune reactions are mediated by interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 acts on a specific IL-2 cell surface receptor; moreover, a soluble form of IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) can be released in the blood. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of surgery on sIL-2R serum levels in patients with operable solid tumors. A total of 48 patients with cancer and 11 controls who underwent major surgery for non-neoplastic disease were evaluated before and 7 days after surgery. Serum mean levels of sIL-2R were significantly higher after than before surgery in both the cancer and control groups. No correlation was seen between surgery-induced changes in sIL-2R and in T lymphocyte subsets. Because of its capacity of binding to IL-2, the increased blood concentrations of sIL-2R could reduce the IL-2 availability and negatively affect antitumor immune reactions. \nComputed tomography for patient management in coronary artery disease. Computed tomography (CT) represents the optimum theoretical approach to x-ray imaging. This conclusion results from an awareness of CT's capacity to solve the fundamental limitation of all forms of x-ray imaging--the superimposition of anatomic structures. Because CT is potentially a fully three-dimensional method, this problem is addressed in a manner not subject to the risks, complications, and technical limitations of selective angiography, subtraction angiography, tomography, and other techniques. Ultrafast CT provides a broad spectrum of useful quantitative cardiac data during one minimally invasive procedure. Therefore, the optimism for cine CT imaging of the heart is well founded. Apart from the demonstration of anatomic structures in any reconstructed plane and in movie format, without the need for any form of electrocardiographic gating, this new generation of millisecond CT scanners offers a unique potential for measuring myocardial mechanics and perfusion. Myocardial integrity can be evaluated by measuring myocardial wall thickening, which is a sensitive indicator of blood flow. It can also be assessed by time-density changes derived from analyzing the passage of contrast medium through thin slices of myocardium. Feasibility studies have demonstrated that this should be possible in the clinical setting by use of fast CT scanning. The radiation exposure to the patient with cine CT is low and comparable to, or less than, that of conventional CT and 10-15% of that received during angiocardiography; therefore, it is not a practical limitation. Further clinical and research studies are needed to determine the future role of this exciting new modality in the diagnosis and management of patients with heart disease. \nPropranolol in the management of recurrent migraine: a meta-analytic review. We used meta-analytic statistical techniques to synthesize findings from studies that evaluated propranolol HCI for the prevention of recurrent migraine (2,403 treated patients). The modal migraine sufferer treated in these studies was a female, about 37 years of age, who suffered from common (rather than classical) migraines and reported a 17-year history of problem migraines. The modal treatment was 160 mg. propranolol per day. Meta-analysis revealed that, on average, propranolol yielded a 44% reduction in migraine activity when daily headache recordings were used to assess treatment outcome, and a 65% reduction in migraine activity when less conservative measures (e.g., clinical ratings of improvement, global patient reports) were used. Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial support for short-term effectiveness of propranolol. However, little information was available concerning the long-term effectiveness of propranolol. \nLarge vessel vasculitis of the central nervous system in systemic lupus erythematosus: report and review of the literature. Large vessel vasculitis rarely involves the central nervous system in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe an exemplary case, along with its dramatic cerebral angiogram, and review the literature on this unusual entity. \nSquamous cell carcinoma occurring in the wall of a chronic aspergilloma. An aspergilloma that occurred within an area of bronchiectasis in a 52 year old man persisted for 12 years despite medical and surgical treatment. A squamous cell carcinoma developed in the wall of the cavity. \nDNA ploidy patterns of tumors diagnosed as metachronous or recurrent lung cancers. The relationship between the first tumor and the second tumor resected in 8 patients with non-small cell lung cancer was analyzed using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) flow cytometry. Of the 8 patients, 6 were clinically diagnosed as having metachronous lung cancers and 2, local recurrent tumors. The mean interval between operations in patients with metachronous lung cancers was 62 months (range, 15 to 128 months). Both tumors showed the same histology in 4 patients and a different histology in 2. In the 2 patients with local recurrent tumors, the interval between operations was 9 months and 39 months. In the analysis of DNA flow cytometry of the first and second tumors in the same patient, the tumors were defined as independent of each other when one tumor showed diploidy and the other, aneuploidy, or when each DNA index of abnormal clones between two aneuploid tumors was different. When both tumors showed diploidy or when at least one DNA index of abnormal clones between two aneuploid tumors was identical, the tumors were defined to be related to each other. According to these criteria, in 5 (83%) of the 6 patients clinically diagnosed as having metachronous lung cancers, the second tumor was classified as independent of the first tumor. On the other hand, in the 2 patients clinically diagnosed as having recurrent tumors, the second tumor was judged to be related to the first tumor. These data suggest that DNA flow cytometric analysis of tumors may be of value in the diagnosis of metachronous lung cancers. \nIntravenous nitroglycerine in the management of posttreatment hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy. Intravenous nitroglycerine is not described in the psychiatric literature for management of the inevitable and potentially dangerous pressor response encountered in electroconvulsive treatment. However, the anesthesia literature has documented the use of nitroglycerine for the management of similar catecholamine-based hypertension. Unlike other approaches, nitroglycerine creates a controlled, significant, brief vasodilatation after convulsive treatment accompanied by desirable coronary vasodilatation without increased cardiac stress. A review of a series of treatments in which this technique was used confirms the clinical efficacy and safety of this approach. \nRaised exercise diastolic blood pressure as indicator of ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction. 91 (16.8%) of 541 consecutive patients investigated for chest pain or after recent uncomplicated myocardial infarction had a rise in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of more than 15 mm Hg during a symptom-limited treadmill test. 63 also had electrocardiographic evidence of ischaemia, but 28 did not have 1 mm ST segment depression, of whom 24 had angiographic evidence of more than 70% stenosis of two or more major coronary arteries. 55 of these 91 patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery; repeat angiography in 22 at 12 months showed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction in 18 who had a normal postoperative DBP response, but no change in ejection fraction in the 4 who still had an abnormal rise in DBP on exercise. Exercise-induced ischaemia may cause a reversible fall in cardiac output that sometimes leads to reflex vasoconstriction and a rise in DBP before a fall in systolic blood pressure or ECG evidence of ST segment depression. An abnormal DBP response to exercise may identify some patients at high risk of myocardial infarction who might otherwise have false-negative exercise tests. \nThe lack of relationship between hepatotoxicity and lithocholic-acid sulfation in biliary bile acids during chenodiol therapy in the National Cooperative Gallstone Study. To test whether hepatotoxicity occurring in National Cooperative Gallstone Study patients was caused by a toxic effect of chenodiol per se or of lithocholate caused by defective sulfation, bile samples were analyzed using a new high-performance liquid chromatography method that measures the proportions of the four individual lithocholate amidates (sulfated and unsulfated lithocholylglycine and lithocholyltaurine) and all common bile acid amidates. Samples were obtained from National Cooperative Gallstone Study patients (n = 17) with abnormal light microscopic liver biopsy results or major aminotransferase elevations and from a matched control group of patients (n = 14) who received similar chenodiol doses but had no evidence of liver injury. Bile samples from 45 healthy subjects were also analyzed. The analytical method was validated by showing that the percentage of chenodiol and cholic and deoxycholic acid obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography correlated highly (r greater than 0.94) with previous gas-liquid chromatography analyses of these samples by the National Cooperative Gallstone Study Reference Laboratory. No significant differences were seen between gallstone patients with and without evidence of liver injury for percent total lithocholate amidates, percent sulfated or unsulfated lithocholate amidates or percent chenodiol amidates. Lithocholate was partially sulfated in all bile samples (52% +/- 17% [mean +/- S.D., n = 50]), but the extent of sulfation varied widely between and within patients during the course of therapy. Mean values of healthy subjects were similar and also showed a wide range in the extent of lithocholate sulfation. It is concluded that (a) liver injury caused by these doses of chenodiol could not be attributed to the accumulation of unsulfated lithocholate per se in circulating bile acids; (b) liver injury appeared to be, directly or indirectly, caused by enrichment in circulating bile acids with chenodiol or chenodiol together with lithocholate, suggesting that the hepatocytes of those patients with hepatotoxicity were injured by the change induced in bile-acid metabolism by the feeding of chenodiol; and (c) about half of lithocholate amidates in bile samples were sulfated, but the extent of sulfation was highly variable both in gallstone patients and healthy subjects. \nEffects of rigidity of an internal fixation device. A comprehensive biomechanical investigation. Internal fixation with instrumentation often accompanies surgical fusion to augment spinal stability, provide temporary fixation while the surgical fusion mass unites, and enhance postoperative mobilization of a patient. Some surgeons, however, feel that the existing plate-screw designs are too rigid and are the primary cause of \"iatrogenic\" adverse effects clinically observed. A three-part study, involving in vitro experimental protocol, analytical finite-element-based models, and an in vivo canine investigation, was undertaken to study the role of decreasing rigidity of a device on the biomechanical response of the stabilized segments. Two alternatives--the use of one variable screw placement (Steffee plate [unilateral, 1VSP model]) as opposed to two VSP plates (bilateral, 2VSP model) and two VSP plates with polymer washers placed in between the integral nut and plate (2MVSP model)--were considered for achieving a reduction in the rigidity of the conventional VSP system. The load-displacement data obtained from the in vitro experiments and the stress distributions within the stabilized and intact models predicted by the finite-element models revealed that the unilateral VSP system is less rigid and is likely to reduce stress shielding of the vertebral bodies compared with the 2VSP model. The undesirable effects associated with the use of the 1VSP plate system are the presence of coupled motions due to the inherent asymmetry and the likely inability to provide enough rigidity for decompression procedures requiring a complete excision of the disc. The use of two MVSP plates overcomes these deficiencies. \nNatural history of acquired renal cystic disease in dialysis patients: a prospective longitudinal CT study. Patients with end-stage kidney disease, particularly those treated with dialysis, develop proliferative processes in their native kidneys that result in the formation of multiple acquired renal cysts, renal adenomas, and carcinomas. Data about these abnormalities have been acquired mainly from retrospective studies. We undertook a longitudinal prospective study in which the native kidneys of 30 dialysis patients were surveyed by serial CT during a 7-year period to study the natural history of acquired renal cystic disease and the frequency of associated complications. Acquired cysts were seen in 87% of patients at the end of the study compared with 57% at the study's onset, and a significant increase was seen in mean renal volume with time. Five patients (17%) developed large hemorrhagic renal cysts and four (13%) developed large perinephric hematomas. Renal cell carcinomas developed in two patients (7%) without renal symptoms. One carcinoma invaded the renal capsule, but did not cause metastases. The other carcinoma was widely metastatic. Our findings are consistent with those of earlier studies documenting an increased prevalence of renal cell carcinoma in dialysis patients as compared with the general population. However, our conclusions are limited because the study sample is small and no control population was studied. We conclude that acquired renal cystic disease in dialysis patients is a progressive disorder often associated with cyst hemorrhage. Dialysis patients may also have an increased prevalence of renal cell carcinoma. \nLong-term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use and Helicobacter pylori infection. This study investigates whether patients who take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are more likely to have Helicobacter pylori gastritis than age-matched individuals who do not take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and whether patients who take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs who are also infected with H. pylori are more likely to have dyspepsia, mucosal damage, or ulcers than those who are not infected. Two studies were performed, one serological and the other endoscopic, both in arthritis patients receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs chronically. The presence of H. pylori was identified with a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. One hundred eighty-three patients participated in the serological study and 75 patients in the endoscopic study. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased with age, independent of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use; the age-adjusted frequency of H. pylori infection in arthritis patients paralleled that of 351 asymptomatic individuals without arthritis. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased from 30.7% in age group 21-30 years to 73.4% in age group 61-75 years. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced mucosal injury, either hemorrhages or erosions, was more frequent in those without H. pylori infection than with infection (61% vs. 32% for hemorrhages and 57% vs. 34% for erosions for those without and with H. pylori infection; only the difference in the frequency of hemorrhages was significant, P less than 0.05). No difference was observed in the presence of dyspeptic symptoms between those with and without H. pylori infection. These data suggest that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced damage to the gastroduodenal mucosa does not increase the susceptibility to H. pylori infection. \nProminent meningeal \"tail sign\" in a patient with a metastatic tumor. A prominent enhancement of the dura adjacent to meningiomas has been described as being pathognomonic of these tumors. We describe a case where a classic meningeal \"tail sign\" was associated with an extra-axial metastatic tumor attached to the tentorium. There was no tumor invasion of the dura. We conclude that this sign is nonspecific and can be seen with dural-based tumors other than meningiomas. \nEnhanced detection of intracardiac sources of cerebral emboli by transesophageal echocardiography. We performed transesophageal echocardiography in 50 consecutive hospitalized patients with recent transient ischemic attack or stroke of embolic origin to determine whether transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in detection of possible intracardiac sources of embolism. Twenty-six of 50 patients with a negative transthoracic echocardiogram for potential source of emboli had a transesophageal echocardiography study that demonstrated at least one intracardiac abnormality. Abnormalities noted by transesophageal echocardiography included five of 50 patients with either a left atrial or left atrial appendage clot, four patients with a patent foramen ovale, and nine patients with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast. In 11 of 50 patients with no other source of embolism, we found highly mobile filamentous strands on the mitral valve, which have not been described previously. These mitral valve echo strands may represent a fissured surface or fibrosis that can serve as a nidus for thrombus formation. We detected no unexpected left ventricular thrombus or left atrial myxoma. Factors significantly associated with a greater likelihood of a positive transesophageal echocardiography study included left atrial enlargement, atrial fibrillation, and a calcified or thickened mitral valve. Our study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is a valuable addition to transthoracic echocardiography in investigating potential intracardiac sources of embolism. \nIncidental microvesicular steatosis due to valproic acid anticonvulsant therapy. Valproic acid has been implicated in at least 100 cases of fatal acute liver failure. Most cases have occurred in patients less than 10 yr old; however, at least seven have involved adults. Microvesicular steatosis has been uniformly observed, but its incidence in less severe liver disease and in asymptomatic patients receiving valproate is unknown. We report two patients receiving maintenance valproate, one with resolving acute hepatitis C and the other with chronic persistent hepatitis C, with incidental microvesicular steatosis demonstrated on oil-red O stains. We conclude that microvesicular steatosis does not necessarily signify hepatotoxicity in patients on chronic valproic acid, and should not lead to discontinuation of the drug until other causes of acute or chronic liver disease have been excluded. \nSafety and efficacy of alfentanil and halothane in paediatric surgical patients. Alfentanil, a congener of the opioid fentanyl, possesses properties that make it an attractive choice for use during short operative procedures. Since the pharmacodynamic aspects of alfentanil have not been well documented in children, this study was undertaken to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and dose requirements of alfentanil when used with nitrous oxide or halothane in paediatric patients. Eighty unpremedicated patients, ASA physical status I or II and aged 2-12 yr were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. After induction of anaesthesia with nitrous oxide, oxygen, and halothane, the groups were treated as follows. In Group 1 (n = 19), after halothane was discontinued, alfentanil 50 micrograms.kg-1 was infused over 30 sec. In Group 2 (n = 20), the end-tidal halothan was maintained at 0.5% and alfentanil 25 micrograms.kg-1 was infused. In Group 3 (n = 20), the end-tidal halothane concentration was maintained at 1% and alfentanil 12.5 micrograms.kg-1 was infused. In Group 4 (n = 21), the end-tidal halothane concentration was maintained at 1.5% and no alfentanil was administered. Patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3 received bolus doses of alfentanil 12.5 micrograms.kg-1 as needed to maintain haemodynamic stability. After alfentanil administration, there were transient decreases in systolic blood pressure in Groups 1 and 2, and in heart rate in Group 2. With surgical stimulation, haemodynamic stability was well maintained except in patients in Group 1, who had an increase in systolic blood pressure. Children Group 1 were alert sooner and their tracheas were extubated earlier than those in Groups 2, 3, and 4. \nEffect of propofol on the incidence of postoperative vomiting after strabismus surgery in pediatric outpatients. Vomiting is a common problem after strabismus surgery in pediatric outpatients. We compared the effects of propofol with and without N2O and droperidol to the effects of a conventional regimen consisting of halothane-N2O-droperidol on the recovery characteristics and the incidence of postoperative emesis after strabismus surgery in 120 ASA physical status 1 or 2 children. After induction of anesthesia with halothane-N2O, patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Group A (control) received halothane, 66% N2O, and droperidol 75 micrograms.kg-1; group B, propofol 2 mg.kg-1 bolus followed by infusion of 160 microgram.kg-1.min-1; group C, propofol (as in group B) and 66% N2O; and group D, propofol (as in group B), 66% N2O (as in group C), and droperidol 75 micrograms.kg-1. Patients in group B had more episodes of intraoperative oculocardiac reflex responses than patients in group A, but had shorter times to extubation, oral intake, ambulation, and discharge, as well as a lower incidence of postoperative emesis (P less than 0.05). The addition of N2O to the propofol anesthetic regimen (group C) was associated with an increased incidence of emesis (P less than 0.05), whereas the addition of droperidol to the propofol-N2O regimen (group D) did not affect the incidence of emesis compared to the other three groups. We conclude that maintenance of anesthesia with a total intravenous regimen using propofol results in a more rapid recovery and less postoperative emesis than with a halothane-N2O-droperidol regimen. \nCholedocholithiasis. Endoscopic sphincterotomy or common bile duct exploration. A prospective randomized trial was conducted of preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy and surgery (ES&S) or surgery alone (SA) in 52 patients with cholecystolithiasis and choledocholithiasis that were candidates for elective surgery. After ES&S 65% of patients were stone free. Eighty-eight per cent of patients with SA were stone free after surgery (p less than 0.05). Three patients in each group had residual stones at the completion of the operation. Five of these six had more than 20 common bile duct (CBD) stones. There was one episode of major hemorrhage in a patient in each group and no deaths. Costs were essentially equal for the individual patient with a successful ES as compared to SA. Societal costs of a program of preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and ES would be higher because of the cost of screening for patients with CBD stones. These results do not support preoperative ES as a technique for clearance of the CBD of stones on the basis of efficacy, morbidity rate, or cost. \nInoperable recurrence after breast-conserving surgical treatment and radiotherapy. Factors associated with inoperable local recurrence were investigated by a clinical and pathologic review of 596 patients with Stages I and II carcinoma of the breast treated by breast-conserving operations and megavoltage radiotherapy. After a median follow-up period of 71 months, 13 of 70 local recurrences observed were anatomically unsuitable for salvage surgical treatment, affecting 2.2 per cent of patients initially treated. In most, inoperable recurrences clinically resembled primary inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. All inoperable failures occurred in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and were associated with the presence of unfavorable prognostic features (positive nodes, histologic grade 3, negative estrogen receptor, vascular invasion and lymphocytic stromal reaction). Despite doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, prognosis after inoperable recurrence was quite poor, although survival time in excess of two years was seen in receptor positive, lower grade recurrent tumors in which treatment included hormone therapy. \nExophytic signet-ring cell carcinoma of the colorectum Previous studies have assessed colorectal signet-ring cell carcinomas of the linitis plastica variant but not of the exophytic subtype. We retrospectively reviewed 20 cases of colorectal signet-ring cell carcinoma of the exophytic subtype (greater than 50% signet-ring cells). The patients ranged in age from 14 to 79 years (mean, 51.8 years); 10 were male; 17 were white; and three were black. Ten tumors were colonic (eight, right sided; two, left sided) and 10 were rectal; seven were stage B and 12 were stage C. One patient presented with distant metastases. Eleven of 16 tumors assessed by flow cytometry were diploid. Parenchymal hepatic metastases developed in only two patients. The overall 5-year survival rate was 36%, and matched cases did not vary significantly in survival from typical nonmucinous adenocarcinomas. There was a trend toward poorer survival for patients with advanced-stage tumor. Survival was not affected by primary site, ploidy, presence of vascular/lymphatic invasion or residual adenoma, or percentage of extracellular mucin or signet-ring cells. Our cases were somewhat lower stage than literature cases of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lintis plastica variant. \nThe relationship between MMPI cluster membership and diagnostic category in headache patients. Only one study has examined MMPI cluster profiles in the headache population. The present study expanded on this previous investigation by using a large sample size (N = 485) and a greater number of diagnostic categories. The five MMPI clusters replicated previous findings in the chronic pain literature. These MMPI cluster groups were compared to 5 diagnostic categories (migraine, cluster, post-trauma, tension, mixed). No relationship was found between cluster type and headache diagnosis. While the diagnostic groups were found to differ on measures of pain severity, sex and age, cluster groups did not. It is proposed that MMPI scale types reflect a patient's response to pain and are more likely to be the result of coping resources than headache-related personality style. Future research with additional, non-pain populations and prospective studies is suggested. \nSkin acceptance of transcutaneous nitroglycerin patches: a prospective study of 33 patients. Transdermal nitroglycerin is commonly used and may induce contact dermatitis. The frequency of adverse skin reactions is controversial and may vary from 10% to 75%, according to various authors. 33 patients using transdermal nitroglycerin for more than 7 days were examined and patch tested (nitroglycerin 0.5% aq., 2% pet. and TTS in toto). 5 patients (15%) had adverse reactions. The patch tests were all negative in the 33 patients. Contact dermatitis occurs in many cases, about 15% of the cases with the newly available TTS, and even if patients respect the conditions for using TTS. These contact dermatitides are mainly irritant reactions and do not require transdermal nitroglycerin treatment to be stopped. Nevertheless, since some cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported, a contact dermatitis from transdermal nitroglycerin should lead to patch testing. \nIntravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia of superior vena cava: a rare cause of the superior vena cava syndrome. The superior vena cava syndrome associated with an intraluminal vascular proliferative lesion is extremely rare. A case of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia of the superior vena cava causing obstructive symptoms is reported that was successfully managed by surgical excision. \nPancytopenia associated with hypothermia. This is the first report of pancytopenia associated with moderate hypothermia occurring in an elderly patient, where no other etiologic or associated factors could account for the hematologic abnormalities found. Reversible pancytopenia should be added to the list of hematologic abnormalities that can be seen in patients with hypothermia. \nThe decline of mortality due to stroke: a competitive and deterministic perspective. Although stroke mortality has been declining since the first part of this century, the rate of decline increased sharply during the early 1970s. The basis for the fall in stroke mortality is often attributed to effective management of risk factors, particularly hypertension. However, some investigators have questioned whether risk factor reduction alone can adequately account for the magnitude of the recent decline in stroke mortality. When viewed from the perspective of competitive and deterministic mortality dynamics, the major force decreasing stroke mortality is the decreasing deterministic competitiveness of stroke and the increasing deterministic competitiveness of various malignant neoplasms and degenerative diseases as causes of mortality. These reciprocal trends are a natural consequence of the competitive deterministic mortality dynamics which describe these diseases in an environment that is becoming more conducive to human survival. The competitive nature of human mortality makes drawing etiopathogenic conclusions based upon single disease mortality data hazardous. \nClinical course of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in children Previous studies in adults with dilated cardiomyopathy suggest that the presence of arrhythmia, especially ventricular tachycardia, correlates with increased mortality. We performed a retrospective analysis of 63 children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to determine the prognostic significance of arrhythmias and other findings with respect to mortality. The mean age at diagnosis of the cardiomyopathy was 4.96 +/- 5.3 years. The overall mortality rate was 16% over a 10 year follow-up period. Persistent congestive heart failure and ST-T wave changes correlated with increased mortality (p less than 0.05). No other variables affected outcome. Arrhythmias were found in 46% of the patients; of the arrhythmias, 48% were atrial arrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia was present in six patients. Death occurred in 4 (14%) of 29 patients with known arrhythmia; 1 of the 5 died suddenly. The remaining 6 deaths in the series occurred in the 34 patients without a documented arrhythmia. It is concluded that 1) arrhythmias are frequently seen in children with dilated cardiomyopathy but are not predictive of outcome; 2) sudden death in children with this disease is rare; and 3) persistent congestive heart failure portends a poor prognosis. \nBleeding complications following initiation of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction: a comparison of helicopter-transported and nontransported patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of helicopter transport of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after initiation of thrombolysis on bleeding complications through hospital discharge. DESIGN: Prospectively identified incidence (cohort) study. SETTING: Air medical service of tertiary-care teaching hospital. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-five consecutive AMI patients transported within 12 hours of the initiation of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator were compared with 119 nontransported AMI patients treated in a similar manner. RESULTS: The transported and nontransported populations were similar with regard to age, sex, and infarct location. Transport was well tolerated with no episodes of cardiac arrest or cardioversion occurring during transport. Hypotension requiring fluids or increased pressors occurred in 18 patients. Bleeding complications of all types occurred in 43.2% of the transported and 49.6% of the nontransported patients, respectively (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.17). CONCLUSION: Helicopter transport of AMI patients after initiation of thrombolysis appears to be safe acutely and without a clinically significant increase in risk of bleeding complications through hospital discharge when accomplished by a highly skilled team. \nStrongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection and central nervous system involvement in a patient with relapsing polychondritis. Infections caused by Strongyloides stercoralis are not uncommon in the United States. Because of the many different manifestations of hyperinfection with this nematode, a high index of suspicion is essential, especially in immunocompromised patients, for whom such infections are frequently fatal. Patients originating from endemic areas and those who have traveled to such areas, even in the distant past, should have the possibility of strongyloidiasis evaluated before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Once considered, the diagnosis is not difficult and can be accomplished using readily available techniques and methods. Although thiabendazole has a high incidence of side effects and may not always eradicate infection, it remains the drug of choice for disseminated strongyloidiasis. \nPercutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian arteries: long-term results in 52 patients. We studied the long-term results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery in treating stenosis (43 patients) or occlusion (nine patients). In all 52 patients, the blood pressure before treatment in the arm on the involved side was at least 30 mm Hg lower than that in the opposite arm. Thirty-nine patients (75%) had symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency (dizziness, blurred vision, ataxia). Angioplasty was successful in 40 (93%) of 43 patients with stenosis and in five (56%) of nine patients with occlusion. In the successfully treated patients, follow-up angiograms showed absence of narrowing greater than 30% stenosis, and the blood pressure in the treated arm equaled that in the opposite arm. The patients were followed up for 6-48 months (mean, 29 months). During this time, the blood pressure in the treated arm remained n",
