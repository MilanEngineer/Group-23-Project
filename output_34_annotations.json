        "text": "fied on methenamine silver stain of BAL fluid. BAL fluid was also stained with a modified Wright-Giemsa technique. The Wright-Giemsa stain was done to determine the cell differential count, and the number of P. carinii clusters associated with 500 nucleated cells was used as an estimate of P. carinii burden in the BAL. Initial and follow-up lavage was performed in 56 patients. Patients were classified based on their clinical response to anti-P. carinii therapy at 21 days. Nonresponders were patients with persistent or worsening symptoms. Responders were patients who improved and had therapy discontinued. Responders were further classified as responders with relapse if P. carinii pneumonia recurred within 6 months of the initial episode or responders without relapse if they remained disease free during the follow-up period. Responders without relapse reduced P. carinii cluster counts more than 50% in 24 of 25 cases. In responders with relapse P. carinii cluster counts were unchanged. The responders as a group had a significant decrease in the percentage of neutrophils in the BAL, with only 2 of 32 still having increased neutrophils in the follow-up lavage compared to 17 of 24 nonresponders (p less than 0.0001). \nAntral choanal polyp presenting as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children is commonly caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The diagnostic criteria of OSAS in children are not so well delineated as in adults. We report the first case of antral choanal polyp presenting as OSAS in a 10-year-old boy that initially presented to the child psychiatry service for behavior disturbance, enuresis, and daytime somnolence. Overnight electroencephalogram sleep study revealed events consistent with OSAS. Multiple inhalant allergies, chronic maxillary sinusitis, and obstructive adenoid hypertrophy were diagnosed by the allergy and otolaryngology services. The child was scheduled for adenoidectomy when his sleep apnea symptoms persisted following antimicrobial therapy. Examination under anesthesia revealed a normal adenoid bed and a large left antral choanal polyp. Polypectomy was performed as dictated by parental consent. Postoperatively treatment with an intranasal steroid was begun. However, polypoid nasal mucosa recurred in 2 months and a Caldwell-Luc procedure was performed. Subjective reports following surgery indicated improvement in daytime irritability, attention, and mood. A follow-up overnight electroencephalogram sleep study confirmed resolution of OSAS. \nAcquisition of protease resistance by prion proteins in scrapie-infected cells does not require asparagine-linked glycosylation. The scrapie and cellular isoforms of the prion protein (PrPSc and PrPC) differ strikingly in a number of their biochemical and metabolic properties. The structural features underlying these differences are unknown, but they are thought to result from a posttranslational process. Both PrP isoforms contain complex type oligosaccharides, raising the possibility that differences in the asparagine-linked glycosylation account for the properties that distinguish PrPC and PrPSc. ScN2a and ScHaB cells in culture produce several PrP molecules with relative molecular masses of 26-35 kDa and proteinase K-resistant cores of 19-29 kDa. When the cells were treated with tunicamycin, this heterogeneity was eliminated and a single PrP species of 26 kDa was observed. Several hours after its synthesis, a fraction of this protein became insoluble in detergents and acquired a proteinase K-resistant core, thus displaying two of the biochemical hallmarks of PrPSc. Synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin restricted the proteinase K-resistant cores of PrP to a single species of 19 kDa. No proteinase K-resistant PrP was found in uninfected cells. Expression of a mutated PrP gene lacking both asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in ScN2a cells resulted in the synthesis of 19-kDa proteinase K-resistant PrP molecules. We conclude that asparagine-linked glycosylation is not essential for the synthesis of proteinase K-resistant PrP and that structural differences unrelated to asparagine-linked oligosaccharides must exist between PrPC and PrPSc. Whether unglycosylated PrPSc molecules are associated with scrapie prion infectivity remains to be established. \nSensitive detection of clonal antigen receptor gene rearrangements for the diagnosis and monitoring of lymphoid neoplasms by a polymerase chain reaction-mediated ribonuclease protection assay. This report describes a novel assay involving the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RNase protection for the rapid and sensitive detection of malignant lymphoid cells by nucleotide sequences within their individual rearranged gamma T-cell receptor (TCRG) genes. In this assay, clonal rearrangements are amplified from the DNA of diagnostic tumor specimens using a consensus V segment primer and a consensus J segment primer to which the promoter for T7 RNA polymerase has been appended. The PCR product from this amplification is transcribed into a radiolabeled RNA probe. Test RNA transcribed from the opposite DNA strand is synthesized by similar methods from TCRG genes of a subsequent biopsy specimen. The test RNA is hybridized with the probe, and mismatched nucleotide sequences in the RNA hybrids are digested by RNase A. Detection of fully protected probe by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography indicates the presence of malignant cells in the test specimen. Dilution experiments with DNA of cell lines from acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) show that detection of one tumor cell among 10(5) normal bone marrow cells is usually possible. Residual disease was also successfully detected in several cases of ALL during clinical remission, including detection in one case at the 10(-5) level. The procedure described here may provide a simplified and rapid method for the sensitive diagnosis and monitoring of lymphoid malignancies. This procedure should be applicable to most antigen receptor genes, and unlike most comparable methods, requires neither analysis of nucleotide sequence nor synthesis of tumor-specific oligonucleotide probes or primers. \nRed cell membrane sodium transport: possible genetic role and use in identifying patients at risk of essential hypertension. To investigate the influence of a family history of essential hypertension on abnormalities of red cell membrane sodium transport, 28 hypertensive children and their families were studied. In 15 families one or both parents had either essential hypertension or a strong family history. In 13 families neither parent had essential hypertension or a positive family history. There were significant differences between the children with a positive family history of essential hypertension compared with those without. Values are expressed as mean (SD): intracellular sodium concentration (mmol/l cells) 8.19 (2.18) compared with 6.41 (0.98); sodium efflux rate constant 0.4873 (0.1379) compared with 0.5831 (0.1104); and numbers of sodium-potassium ATPase pump sites (BMax) (nmol/l cells) 7.96 (1.71) compared with 9.56 (1.7). Significant differences were also found when the index hypertensive children were excluded and the normotensive siblings with and without hypertensive family histories were compared. These data suggest that abnormal red cell membrane sodium transport has a familial component, and although it is not caused by the hypertension it may be the earliest pathophysiological step in its development, perhaps allowing the identification of children at risk of essential hypertension. \nNerve growth factor receptor expression in peripheral and central neuroectodermal tumors, other pediatric brain tumors, and during development of the adrenal gland. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is important to the survival, development, and differentiation of neurons. Its action is mediated by a specific cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein, nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). In this study, NGFR expression by human fetal and adult adrenal medullary tissue, peripheral nervous system (PNS) neuroectodermal tumors (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma), pediatric primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) of the central nervous system (CNS), and CNS gliomas was examined by an immunohistochemical technique. Sixty-nine tumors in total were probed in this manner. Nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity was confined to nerve fibers and clusters of primitive-appearing cells in the fetal adrenal, and to nerve fibers and ganglion cells of the adult adrenal medulla; adrenal chromaffin cells were negative. In PNS neuroectodermal tumors, there was NGFR expression in tumor cells of 6 of 11 neuroblastomas and 6 of 6 ganglioneuroblastomas or ganglioneuromas. Thirteen of thirty-five CNS PNETs showed NGFR positivity. In most CNS PNETs, NGFR was restricted to scattered single or small groups of cells, but two tumors with astroglial differentiation showed much more extensive immunoreactivity. Most astrocytomas (11 of 14) and all ependymomas (3 of 3) were intensely NGFR positive. \nChildhood cancers--New Jersey, 1979-1985. In New Jersey, cancers among children aged 0-14 years account for fewer than 1% of all cancers diagnosed annually; however, childhood cancers account for the greatest number of years of potential life lost from cancer. This report summarizes a study by the New Jersey State Department of Health (NJSDH) that determined the incidence and death rates for the most frequent cancers among children aged 0-14 years in New Jersey during 1979-1985; these rates are compared with those for the United States for a comparable period. \nRisk factors for benign oesophageal disease in a random population sample. The association of sex, age, relative weight, smoking and drinking habits, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and economic and marital status, with benign oesophageal disease (BOD) was investigated by means of a point-prevalence study of BOD in a Danish population. A total of 346 individuals, representing subjects who gave positive responses to the discriminating questions pertaining to BOD and risk factors in a previously described questionnaire, as well as control subjects, were invited to participate in a clinical examination. Invasive investigation was accepted by 175 subjects, 114 of whom were diagnosed as having BOD. A statistically significant relationship between BOD and COPD was demonstrated by univariate analysis, and later confirmed by multivariate analysis (P less than 0.01). Odds ratios suggested a non-significant association between BOD and smoking at least 20 g tobacco a day and consuming greater than or equal to 50 alcoholic drinks per week. Obesity, sex, age, marital and economic status were not risk factors for BOD. \nThe clinical course of perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage We studied the early clinical course of 65 patients with perimesencephalic (nonaneurysmal) subarachnoid hemorrhage. None of the patients rebled; none had delayed cerebral ischemia; and only 3 patients (5%) developed clinical signs of acute hydrocephalus, 2 requiring ventricular shunting. Hyponatremia and electrocardiographic changes were found in the same proportions as in patients with aneurysmal rupture. All patients had a good outcome after 3 months. To control for the influence of the relatively small amount of cisternal blood in perimesencephalic hemorrhage on the absence of delayed cerebral ischemia, we compared these 65 patients with 49 patients who had aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This control group with aneurysms was selected according to a similar amount of cisternal blood, a comparable level of consciousness on admission, and absence of other factors known to increase the risk for delayed cerebral ischemia. We found that 4 of the 49 patients with aneurysmal hemorrhage developed delayed cerebral ischemia (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03); therefore the relatively small amount of blood does not account for the absence of delayed cerebral ischemia in perimesencephalic hemorrhage. Patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of hemorrhage and a normal angiogram should be considered to have a distinct subset of subarachnoid hemorrhage and should be excluded from future treatment trials of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. \nAllografts of tumor nuclear transplantation embryos: differentiation competence. The developmental potential of nuclei can be studied by nuclear transplantation. Although amphibian blastula nuclei and other early embryonic nuclei are totipotent, to our knowledge no nucleus from an adult cell has ever been shown to be totipotent by this procedure. Transfer of Lucke renal carcinoma nuclei into enucleated eggs results in prefeeding swimming tadpoles. Inasmuch as these tadpoles die, rescue of this pluripotential tissue was attempted by grafting fragments of triploid tumor nuclear transplant tadpoles to the tails of normal diploid Rana pipiens hosts. Grafts of tumor nuclear transplant tadpole tissue were histologically indistinguishable from grafts of normally fertilized embryos and developed normal-appearing structures such as complete eyes, well-differentiated neural tissues, kidney tubules, and gut epithelium. Moreover, histological differentiation in tumor nuclear transplant grafts was comparable to that observed in 50-day-old normal larvae. Grafting enhanced the survival of tumor nuclear transplant tissue from no more than 14 days as part of the donor tadpole to 40 days at which time the grafts were harvested as healthy tissue. Thus, both differentiation and survival of tumor nuclear transplant tissue were augmented with the grafting procedure. Cytophotometric analysis of ploidy was used to confirm the tumor origin of the donor tissue. \nSelective pulmonary vasodilation by low-dose infusion of adenosine triphosphate in newborn lambs. The systemic and pulmonary vascular effects of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) were investigated in 12 newborn lambs during normoxia and during alveolar hypoxia (10% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 85% nitrogen). Lambs had catheters in the descending aorta, main pulmonary artery, and were studied after a 3-day recovery. We infused ATP or an equal volume of saline solution (control) into the right atrial line in doses ranging from 0.01 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute. In normoxic lambs, ATP caused a significant decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance in doses of 0.08 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute, and in systemic vascular resistance in doses of 0.3 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute. Infusion of ATP in hypoxic lambs caused decreases in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance in all the doses tested. Systemic vascular resistance decreased, and cardiac output and heart rate increased in doses greater than 0.3 mumol/kg per minute in hypoxic lambs during ATP infusion. The effects of ATP in hypoxic lambs were not blocked by propranolol, indomethacin, or theophylline. Plasma ATP levels in left atrial blood samples did not change significantly during the infusion of ATP. We conclude that ATP is a vasodilator in lambs, and its effects are specific for pulmonary circulation at doses of less than or equal to 0.15 mumol/kg per minute. The vasodilator effects of ATP appear to be independent of P1 purinergic and beta-adrenergic mechanisms, and of prostacyclin synthesis. \nThe use of intravenous milrinone in chronic symptomatic ischemic heart disease. To evaluate the antiischemic effects of intravenous milrinone, 20 patients with angiographically proved coronary artery disease and stable angina were studied at rest and during exercise under control conditions and after an intravenous loading injection of milrinone (50 micrograms/kg/10 min) followed by an infusion with 0.5 micrograms/kg/min. Hemodynamic parameters, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and atrial natriuretic factor were assessed. Control ergometry revealed ischemia; however, during exercise with intravenous milrinone, ischemia was eliminated. Because of unloading effects, there was also a significant decrease in ST segment depression (p less than 0.001). Heart rate increased significantly (p less than 0.001) at rest but increased significantly less after exercise testing (p less than 0.001). The changes in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and myocardial oxygen consumption during exercise were not significantly different between the milrinone and control phase. Intravenous milrinone delayed the onset of angina (p less than 0.001) and significantly shortened the duration of anginal attacks (p less than 0.05); exercise duration in the milrinone phase was longer than in the control phase (p = 0.051). Because of vasodilatation, a mild secondary increase in norepinephrine was observed during the milrinone phase, and there was a significantly smaller increase in atrial natriuretic factor during exercise while receiving milrinone as a result of preload reduction (p less than 0.05). Intravenous milrinone produced beneficial hemodynamic and antiischemic effects in patients with coronary artery disease, stable angina, and reproducible ST segment depression probably by enhancing myocardial contractility and reducing preload and afterload. \nCarcinoma of the rectum: a 10-year experience. A consecutive series of 303 patients with carcinoma of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon treated by a single surgeon over a 10-year period are reported. Of these, 202 underwent an anterior resection, 85 an abdominoperineal excision of the rectum and 16 a coloanal anastomosis. Surgery was considered palliative in 52 patients undergoing anterior resection and 24 undergoing abdominoperineal resection. The 30-day hospital mortality rate was six patients (3 per cent) for anterior resection and two patients (2 per cent) for abdominoperineal resection. Peroperative anastomotic testing demonstrated leakage in five stapled anastomoses; these were rectified and no clinical sequelae occurred. Two patients (1 per cent) developed a clinical anastomotic leak, one of which proved fatal; in each case the intraoperative test was negative. The overall 5-year survival rate was 64 per cent after anterior resection and 52 per cent after abdominoperineal resection; the median follow-up was 64 months. The incidence of local pelvic recurrence was 6.4 per cent after anterior resection and 14 per cent after abdominoperineal (not significant). These results confirm the success of sphincter-saving anterior resection combined with total mesorectal excision, routine full mobilization of the splenic flexure and cancercidal lavage of the distal rectum in the treatment of low rectal carcinomas; morbidity, local recurrence and survival are not compromised. \nPontine myelinolysis after correction of hyponatremia during burn resuscitation. Central pontine myelinolysis is a neurologic disease produced by the rapid correction of hyponatremia. This report describes the occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis in a patient with burns. The natural history of this paralyzing condition and suggestions for its prevention are discussed. Severely burned and hyponatremic patients are at risk for this disorder because a large amount of sodium ion is typically required for the treatment of burn shock. Awareness of this phenomenon and avoidance of rapid correction of hyponatremia are essential to its prevention. \nAortoesophageal fistula: a comprehensive review of the literature. Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is a relatively rare but life-threatening cause of upper gastro-intestinal bleeding. The clinical characteristics of AEF are so unique that a presumptive bedside diagnosis can be made at the time of presentation. In the past decade, surgical management has improved to the point that cure is now possible. For these reasons, we have reviewed the literature. We summarize our findings with respect to the etiology and clinical characteristics of AEF. Further, we discuss the diagnostic modalities that may be used to confirm the diagnosis, and the therapeutic modalities available to slow the hemorrhage, so as to allow time to correct the anatomic defect. \nAntihypertensive drug treatment. Potential, expected, and observed effects on stroke and on coronary heart disease. The effects of prolonged differences in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on the risks of stroke and of coronary heart disease (CHD) were estimated from nine major prospective observational studies involving about 420,000 men and women who were followed up for intervals of 6-25 years. The results indicate that a prolonged difference of about 6 mm Hg in DBP was associated with approximately 37% fewer strokes and 23% fewer CHD deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. The effects of equivalent reductions in DBP produced by antihypertensive drug treatment but maintained for only a few years have been estimated in several overviews of randomized trials involving a total of 30,000-40,000 patients. The results of the overviews indicate that treatment reduced the risk of stroke by about 40%, suggesting that most or all the long-term potential benefits for stroke due to lower DBP were achieved within about 3 years of beginning treatment. The risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death may have been reduced by about 10% among patients allocated to active treatment; the 95% confidence limits for the difference ranged from about zero to about 20%. Whatever the true effect of treatment on CHD, it would appear somewhat less than the difference in risk estimated from the observational studies for a prolonged difference in DBP of the same size. This apparent shortfall in benefit may reflect a long time-course for changes in DBP to have their full effects on CHD, possible adverse side effects of the principal trial treatments, or both. \nCardiac rupture secondary to blunt trauma: a rapidly diagnosable entity with two-dimensional echocardiography. A 58-year-old woman involved in a single automobile accident sustained an isolated rupture of the right ventricle without any other obvious form of external trauma. On presentation to an outlying hospital, hypotension was the only apparent clinical finding suggestive of injury. After several hours of delay, the patient was transferred to a tertiary medical center. The diagnosis of cardiac rupture was made by two-dimensional echocardiography. The patient underwent successful surgical repair and was discharged home in good condition eight days after sustaining this potentially fatal injury. \nNonprescription drugs and hypertension. Which ones affect blood pressure? Hypertensive patients should be aware of the possible effects of nonprescription medications on blood pressure control. For absolute safety, no adrenergic agents should be used. Nasal phenylephrine hydrochloride is probably the safest of these agents, and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride may also be safe. Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride and ephedrine sulfate are probably best avoided. The effects of other adrenergic agents (eg, epinephrine) on blood pressure have not been clinically evaluated. Ibuprofen may elevate blood pressure if taken in maximum over-the-counter doses for more than a few days. The ethanol and sodium chloride content of nonprescription drugs taken in recommended doses does not appear to pose a great hazard. \nFire hydrant play: injuries and their prevention. A total of 86 children treated for injuries that occurred while playing in water from fire hydrants are described. Patients were urban (100%), minority (97%) children with few alternative means for keeping cool. Injuries occurred on extremely hot summer days (mean maximum temperature 36.3 degrees C [97.5 degrees F]). Laceration of the foot on broken glass was the most common injury and was prevented by wearing footwear (P less than .001). Motor vehicles caused all serious injuries. Sprinkler attachments on the hydrants were associated with significantly fewer motor vehicle-related injuries (P less than .001) and water pressure-related injuries (P = .02). Adults were present at more than 90% of injury scenes, but had no effect on the safety of fire hydrant play. Public policy should be directed toward increasing the availability of alternative means for keeping cool, increasing the number of hydrants equipped with sprinklers, and reducing the amount of broken glass in the streets. Public education targeting adults to remove glass from the street, insist that children wear footwear, and open only those hydrants that have sprinklers could further reduce injuries to urban children who play in water from fire hydrants. \nImproved tumor imaging with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies by plasma clearance of unbound antibody with anti-antibody column. Imaging of tumors by using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MoAs) is hindered by the presence of background activity. To reduce this problem, the authors investigated the process of removing labeled MoAs from plasma at selected times by means of extracorporeal immunoadsorption. In seven patients with either lung or breast carcinoma, an indium-111-labeled murine antibody was intravenously administered. Six to 24 hours later, immunoadsorption was performed by passing the patients' plasma through a goat anti-mouse antibody column connected to a plasma separator. Whole-body computer images were obtained before and after the treatment. Blood pool activity in the images was reduced by an average of 59%, while tumor activity dropped by only 10%. Tumor-to-blood activity ratios therefore more than doubled, improving by an average of 121% between the pre- and posttreatment image sets. Eight of 12 areas of known disease and three areas of unknown but later documented disease were detected after the immunoadsorption process, while the three areas of unknown disease and three of the areas of known disease were not detected in the preclearance images. Thus, the feasibility of using extracorporeal immunoadsorption to improve MoA imaging of tumors was demonstrated. \nElectrophysiologic recording and thermodynamic modeling demonstrate that helium-neon laser irradiation does not affect peripheral Adelta- or C-fiber nociceptors. The effect of helium-neon laser irradiation (632.5 nm) on A delta- and C-fiber sensory afferents was investigated in the rabbit cornea, to determine the physiologic basis for reports that low power (0.1-5 mW) helium-neon (He-Ne) lasers produce acute analgesia and alleviate chronic pain. Multiple and single unit extracellular recordings from nociceptive corneal afferent nerves (C-fiber cold, C-fiber chemical, A delta mechanical and A delta bimodal) were used to study the effects of He-Ne laser radiation upon the electrophysiologic responses to mechanical, thermal, chemical and electrical stimulation of the cornea. Action potentials were analyzed for latency, amplitude, rise time, duration and frequency. Exposure of the neural receptive field and/or nerve bundle to a 4-mm diameter He-Ne laser (0-5 mW; 0-1800 sec) did not alter spontaneous or evoked neural activity. In addition, single unit action potential parameters were not altered by laser irradiation. Modeling of thermal changes produced by He-Ne radiation on corneal nerves indicated that effects predicted for receptor and axonal depths in both skin and cornea were minimal (less than 0.15 degrees C) and unlikely to alter sensory transduction or transmission. \nSubmucous resection of the nasal septum as an outpatient procedure. We report our experience of submucous resection of the nasal septum under local anaesthesia as an outpatient procedure. We have audited 50 consecutive cases and compared the results with a similar group of patients in whom the operation was carried out in the usual way under general anaesthesia. We have found the procedure to be safe, effective and economically advantageous. \nNewborn behavioral performance in colic and noncolic infants. The specific purpose of this investigation was to examine the newborn performance of colic and noncolic infants on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (BNBAS). The sample was composed of 119 firstborn infants from healthy, married, white couples. Data were collected prenatally, during the perinatal period, and postnatally from birth through four months of infant age. A total of 38 infants (32%) were believed to have colic. Colicky infants differed significantly from noncolicky infants on one of the seven item clusters, labeled the BNBAS Orientation cluster (p less than .05). \nHistological changes in free jejunal grafts used in pharyngeal reconstruction. A histological study was performed of biopsies taken from jejunal free grafts used in pharyngeal reconstruction. The main findings were a decreased crypt/villi ratio and a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate. There was no evidence of metaplastic or dysplastic transformation. \nVery late recurrence of renal vasculitis. We report a case of renal vasculitis with a relapse occurring 9 and a half years after the original presentation. The plasma creatinine six months before relapse was only 118 mumol/l. During the initial illness there was histological evidence of glomerular damage but at the time of relapse renal biopsy showed the remaining glomeruli to be normal with the destructive process causing fibrinoid necrosis of arteries. \nCardiovascular collapse following orthoclone OKT3 administration: a case report. Orthoclone OKT3 has been described to have significant adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, including pulmonary edema, angina, dysrhythmias, hypertension, and hypotension, usually following the first or second doses of the drug. We describe a case of cardiopulmonary arrest in a patient 1 minute after the initial injection of OKT3. Two subsequent doses were successfully administered with the guidance of hemodynamic monitoring, which showed profound, immediate effects of OKT3 on the cardiovascular system. Potential mechanisms of these effects are discussed. \nSmall bowel obstruction after colon resection for benign and malignant diseases. To determine the etiology and outcome of patients with small bowel obstruction after a colon resection for benign and malignant diseases, the medical records of 118 patients who underwent 120 laparotomies for small bowel obstruction were reviewed. Contrary to previous reports, benign adhesions were responsible for the obstruction in all patients with a history of benign colon disease, 82.6 percent of patients with a history of adenocarcinoma of the colon without known recurrence, and 30.1 percent of patients with known recurrent malignancy. The morbidity and mortality was more related to the etiology of the obstruction rather than the preoperative delay or operative procedure performed. Considering the high likelihood of adhesive obstruction in patients with a history of, or known, metastatic colorectal carcinoma, it is suggested that these not deter surgeons from aggressive early surgical intervention in these patients who develop small bowel obstruction. \nCytochrome c oxidase deficiency with acute onset and rapid recovery. A 7-year-old girl with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency who had no neurologic deficits in infancy suddenly developed ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and respiratory arrest. She recovered almost completely 80 days after onset, suggesting that acute onset and rapid remission are observed in patients with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. It is also possible that early initiation of therapy in cytochrome c oxidase deficiency with coenzyme Q10 may hasten and enhance the therapeutic effect. \nTreatment of fulminant viral hepatic failure with prostaglandin E. A preliminary report. The effect of prostaglandins (PG) in patients with fulminant and subfulminant viral hepatitis was studied. Seventeen patients presented with FHF secondary to hepatitis A (N = 3), hepatitis B (N = 6) and non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis (N = 8). Fourteen of the 17 patients had stage III or IV hepatic encephalopathy (HE). At presentation, the mean AST was 1844 +/- 1246 units/liter, bilirubin 232 +/- 135 mumol/liter, PT 34 +/- 18 and PTT 73 +/- 26 sec, and coagulation factors V and VII were 8 +/- 4 and 9 +/- 51%, respectively. Twelve of 17 patients responded to PGE1 rapidly, with a decrease in AST from 1540 +/- 833 to 188 +/- 324 units/liter, a decrease in prothrombin time from 27 +/- 7 sec to 12 +/- 1 sec, PTT from 61 +/- 10 sec to 31 +/- 2 sec, and an increase in factor V from 9 +/- 4% to 69 +/- 18% and factor VII from 11 +/- 5% to 71 +/- 20%. Five responders with NANB hepatitis relapsed upon discontinuation of therapy, with recurrence of HE and increases in AST and PT but improvement was observed upon retreatment. After four weeks of intravenous therapy, oral PGE2 was substituted. Two patients have recovered completely and remain in remission six and 12 months following cessation of therapy. Two additional patients continue in remission after two and six months of PGE2. No relapses have been seen in patients with hepatitis A virus (HAV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Liver biopsies in the 12 surviving patients have returned to normal. These results suggest efficacy of PGE for FHF. Further investigation is warranted. \nComplete atrioventricular block complicating inferior wall acute myocardial infarction treated with reperfusion therapy. TAMI Study Group. Previous studies report larger myocardial infarcts and increased in-hospital mortality rates in patients with inferior wall acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and complete atrioventricular block (AV), but the clinical implications of these complications in patients treated with reperfusion therapy have not been addressed. The clinical course of 373 patients--50 (13%) of whom developed complete AV block--admitted with inferior wall AMI and given thrombolytic therapy within 6 hours of symptom onset was studied. Acute patency rates of the infarct artery after thrombolytic therapy were similar in patients with or without AV block. Ventricular function measured at baseline and before discharge in patients with complete AV block showed a decrement in median ejection fraction (-3.5 vs -0.4%, p = 0.03) and in median regional wall motion (-0.14 vs +0.24 standard deviations/chord, p = 0.05). The reocclusion rate was higher in patients with complete AV block (29 vs 16%, p = 0.03). Patients with complete AV block had more episodes of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (36 vs 14%, p less than 0.001), sustained hypotension (36 vs 10%, p less than 0.001), pulmonary edema (12 vs 4%, p = 0.02) and a higher in-hospital mortality rate (20 vs 4%, p less than 0.001), although the mortality rate after hospital discharge was identical (2%) in the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that complete AV block was a strong independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (p = 0.0006). Thus, despite initial successful reperfusion, patients with inferior wall AMI and complete AV block have higher rates of in-hospital complications and mortality. \nHypothalamic peptides modulate cytosolic free Ca2+ levels and adenylyl cyclase activity in human nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. The effects of hypothalamic peptides (TRH, GnRH, arginine vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, GHRH, CRH, and SRIH) on cytosolic free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity were evaluated in 12 nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. TRH, GnRH, and arginine vasopressin induced a marked [Ca2+]i rise in 10/12, 4/12, and 2/5 tumors, respectively. The transients induced by these peptides were due to both Ca2+ mobilization from the intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium. AC activity was evaluated in 10 adenomas; 1 microM vasoactive intestinal peptide induced a 2- to 6-fold stimulation of the enzyme activity in all tumors, while neither GHRH nor CRH were effective. Moreover, in 5/10 tumors 1 microM SRIH reduced both AC activity and [Ca2+]i, while in 2/10 the peptide caused a significant rise in [Ca2+]i despite the AC inhibition and in 3/10 SRIH did not modify either AC activity or [Ca2+]i. This study indicates that in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas a wide spectrum of hypothalamic peptides modulate [Ca2+]i and AC activity. Moreover, the presence of biologically active receptors may offer a possible target for therapeutic intervention. \nEffects of interleukin-4 and interleukin-6 on the proliferation of CD34+ and CD34- blasts from acute myelogenous leukemia. We studied the effects of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-6 on the growth of leukemic blasts from 40 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Patients were selected on the basis of negativity for a series of B-cell antigens including CD10 and CD19. Twenty-one cases were CD34-positive (CD34+) (greater than 15% of blasts) and the remaining 19 were CD34-negative (CD34-) (less than 3% of blasts). IL-4 alone (100 U/ml) could stimulate either DNA synthesis (with greater than 2.0 stimulation index) or leukemic blast colony formation in 24 of 40 AML patients. In the presence of other growth factors, IL-4 showed divergent effects on IL-3-, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-, or erythropoietin-dependent colony formation. These effects of IL-4 were observed in both CD34+ and CD34- AML cases. IL-6 (100 U/mL) alone could not stimulate DNA synthesis and blast colony formation except for one CD34+ case. On the other hand, IL-6 showed synergistic effects on IL-3- and IL-4-dependent blast colony formation in 10 of 12 and 7 of 9 CD34+ AML cases, respectively. Among CD34- AML cases, such synergism was seen only in 1 of 12 cases for IL-3-dependent colony formation and in 3 of 7 cases for IL-4-dependent colony formation. The divergent effect of IL-4 and the synergistic effect of IL-6 were also observed in purified CD34+ leukemic blast populations, indicating that these phenomena are not mediated by accessory cells. The present study suggests that IL-4, alone or in combination with other growth factors, has divergent effects on the growth of AML progenitors irrespective of the CD34 expression, and that IL-6 acts synergistically with IL-3 or IL-4 on the growth of leukemic progenitors preferentially in CD34+ AML. \nIs pulsed Doppler velocimetry useful in the management of multiple-gestation pregnancies? Few studies have addressed the significance of umbilical artery pulsed Doppler velocimetry in multiple gestation. Level II ultrasonography and pulsed Doppler studies were performed in 94 twin pairs and seven sets of triplets, which yielded data on 207 fetuses. A systolic/diastolic ratio was calculated for each fetus; abnormal pulsed Doppler velocimetry showed high correlation with adverse pregnancy events. Those with abnormal Doppler findings tended to be born 3 to 4 weeks earlier and to exhibit a greater number of stillbirths and structural malformations, as well as greater morbidity, when compared with fetuses without abnormal Doppler results. Fifteen of 17 infants with abnormal antenatal waveforms suffered serious morbidity. Seven were small for gestational age, and two were borderline for small for gestational age. An additional five infants with abnormal waveforms were appropriate for gestational age but were either recipient or donor in the twin transfusion syndrome. Eleven fetuses with this syndrome are described. Donor twins tended to be severely small for gestational age, with 7 of the 11 infants showing elevated systolic/diastolic ratios. Amniotic fluid volume tended to be diminished in the donor's sac but normal or increased in the recipient's sac. The observations in the study correlate with suspected physiologic changes of this syndrome. Because present findings suggest that fetuses with abnormal velocimetry suffer increased morbidity and mortality, a more rational method of management that uses Doppler data is suggested for multiple gestations. \nPercutaneous biopsy of left adrenal masses: prevalence of pancreatitis after anterior approach. Acute pancreatitis is an unusual but recognized complication of percutaneous aspiration biopsy of the pancreas. As the pancreatic tail is located anterior to the left adrenal gland, percutaneous biopsy of a left adrenal mass via the anterior approach may result in needle passage through the tail of the pancreas with subsequent potential development of pancreatitis. To evaluate this risk, we retrospectively reviewed 48 CT-directed percutaneous aspiration biopsies of left adrenal masses done between 1984 and 1989 at two institutions. Positioning of the patient, the course of the needle, the number of needle passes, and the size of the needle were analyzed. Thirty-three (69%) of 48 biopsies of a left adrenal mass were performed by using the anterior approach. The pancreas was traversed by one or more needles in 32 of 33 cases. Biopsies were performed with 20- to 22-gauge needles, and the number of needle passes varied widely. The medical records of the 33 patients in whom the anterior approach was used also were reviewed for complications. Acute pancreatitis, which required 11-13 days of hospitalization, developed in two patients (6%). None of the other 31 patients suffered a complication. We conclude that the pancreatic tail is routinely traversed by the biopsy needle when biopsy of a left adrenal mass is done via the anterior approach and that severe acute pancreatitis can occur as a result. \nVariability in physicians' decisions on caring for chronically ill elderly patients: an international study. OBJECTIVES: To determine what treatment decisions physicians will make when faced with an incompetent elderly patient with life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding and to identify the factors that affect their decisions. DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: Family practice, medical and geriatrics rounds in academic medical centres and community hospitals in seven countries. PARTICIPANTS: Physicians who regularly cared for incompetent elderly patients. OUTCOME MEASURE: A self-administered questionnaire containing three case vignettes. Each provided the same details on an incompetent elderly patient; however, one gave no information about the wishes of the patient and his family (no directive), the second provided a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) request, and the third included a detailed therapeutic and resuscitative effort chart (DTREC) requesting maximum therapeutic care without admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The four treatment options were supportive care only, limited therapeutic care, maximum therapeutic care without admission to the ICU and maximum care with admission to the ICU. MAIN RESULTS: Treatment decisions varied and were systematically related to age, level of training and country (p less than 0.001). The older physicians and those in family medicine were less likely than the others to choose aggressive treatment options. Brazilian and US physicians were the most aggressive; Australian physicians were the most conservative. The DNR request resulted in a significant decrease in the number of physicians choosing aggressive options (p less than 0.001). The DTREC resulted in a move toward more aggressive treatment, as outlined in the directive (p less than 0.001). Overall, however, about 40% of the physicians chose a level of care different from what had been requested. Furthermore, over 10% would have tried cardiopulmonary resuscitation despite the DNR request. CONCLUSION: Treatment of incompetent elderly patients with life-threatening illness varies widely within and between countries. Uniform standards should be developed on the basis of societal values and be communicated to physicians. \nIntracranial neurenteric cysts. Report of two cases. Two cases of intracranial neurenteric cysts are reported and the literature is reviewed. Neurenteric cysts are rare congenital lesions that tend to occur in the spinal intradural space. An intracranial location is exceptional. \nProton-pump inhibition for acid-related disease. Omeprazole and lansoprazole are the forerunners of a group of substituted benzimidazole compounds that block the gastric proton pump. These drugs exert a potent antisecretory effect by blocking the final common pathway of acid secretion. Prolonged, potent reduction of acid secretion using omeprazole has resulted in significant therapeutic advantage over existing antisecretory medication, such as H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Research experience with lansoprazole indicates that it has treatment properties for acid-related disease that are similar to those of omeprazole. Omeprazole has been used successfully in the treatment of reflux esophagitis and the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in the United States over the past year and has received approval recently as first-line therapy for duodenal ulcer disease. Research involving more than 20,000 individuals, postmarketing surveillance studies, and thorough safety studies in man and animals have shown omeprazole to be well tolerated, with an incidence and spectrum of adverse events in clinical trials similar to those observed with H2RAs. \nEpidural lipomatosis as a cause of spinal cord compression in polymyalgia rheumatica. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common rheumatologic disorder in older individuals that usually requires chronic, low dose corticosteroid therapy for adequate control of symptoms. Epidural lipomatosis is a rare complication of chronic corticosteroid use in which neurologic deficits occur due to extradural fat compression of the spinal cord. The author describes the first reported case of epidural lipomatosis occurring as a complication of corticosteroid therapy in a patient with PMR. \nThe child with spells. The purpose of this article was to discuss paroxysms, both neurologic and non-neurologic, that can mimic seizures. This is summarized in Table 4. It should be clear that the evaluation of any spell in a child should begin with a detailed and complete history. Historical features should focus on all aspects of the event--length of time, situation, appearance, quantity, as well as other features not directly pertaining to the event. Physical and neurologic examinations are frequently normal. Ancillary testing that may prove valuable include routine and video EEG monitoring as well as home video recording. \nControlled trial of hypnotherapy in the treatment of refractory fibromyalgia. In a controlled study, 40 patients with refractory fibromyalgia were randomly allocated to treatment with either hypnotherapy or physical therapy for 12 weeks with followup at 24 weeks. Compared with the patients in the physical therapy group, the patients in the hypnotherapy group showed a significantly better outcome with respect to their pain experience, fatigue on awakening, sleep pattern and global assessment at 12 and 24 weeks, but this was not reflected in an improvement of the total myalgic score measured by a dolorimeter. At baseline most patients in both groups had strong feelings of somatic and psychic discomfort as measured by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. These feelings showed a significant decrease in patients treated by hypnotherapy compared with physical therapy, but they remained abnormally strong in many cases. We conclude hypnotherapy may be useful in relieving symptoms in patients with refractory fibromyalgia. \nChanges in portal blood flow consequent to partial hepatectomy: Doppler estimation. Hemodynamic changes in portal blood flow were investigated in 56 patients with hepatic tumors who underwent partial hepatectomy. Portal flow was measured with a Doppler ultrasound system before, during, and after surgery. The portal flow of patients who underwent massive hepatectomy decreased intraoperatively. The portal flow per unit of cardiac output decreased in patients who underwent massive or major hepatectomy, patients with a cirrhotic liver, and patients who had a satisfactory postoperative course. Postoperatively, the portal flow in patients with a poor clinical outcome (multiple organ failure, hepatic failure, and cardiorespiratory failure) decreased significantly. Monitoring portal hemodynamic values appears to be useful in providing an index of \"hepatic functional reserve.\" Adequate portal flow is essential for postoperative hepatic regeneration; changes in portal hemodynamic values may be directly related to the patient's ability to survive surgery and to regain or maintain normal liver function. \nAneurysms of the intracavernous carotid artery: a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Of 43 cavernous sinus aneurysms diagnosed over 6 1/2 years, 23 fulfilled indications for treatment; of these 19 were treated, eight surgically and 11 with interventional radiological techniques. Six small and two giant aneurysms were treated surgically: four were clipped, two were repaired primarily, and two were trapped with placement of a saphenous-vein bypass graft. Seven large and four giant aneurysms were treated with interventional radiological techniques: in five cases the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) was sacrificed; one aneurysm was trapped with detachable balloons; and five were embolized with preservation of the ICA lumen. The mean follow-up period was 25 months. At follow-up examination, three patients in the surgical group were asymptomatic, two had improved, and three had worsened. Three of these patients had asymptomatic infarctions apparent on computerized tomography (CT) scans. At follow-up examination, four radiologically treated patients were asymptomatic, five had improved, two were unchanged, and none had worsened. One patient had asymptomatic and one minimally symptomatic infarction apparent on CT scans; both lesions were embolic foci after aneurysm embolization with preservation of the ICA. It is concluded that treatment risk depends more on the adequacy of collateral circulation than on the size of the aneurysm. A multidisciplinary treatment protocol for these aneurysms is described, dividing patients into high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups based on pretreatment evaluation of the risk of temporary or permanent ICA occlusion using a clinical balloon test occlusion coupled with an ICA-occluded stable xenon/CT cerebral blood flow study. Radiological techniques are suggested for most low-risk patients, while direct surgical techniques are proposed for most moderate- and high-risk patients. \nAssessment of exercise tolerance in chronic congestive heart failure. In patients with chronic heart failure, exercise capacity is poorly related to cardiac hemodynamics, and peripheral circulation is an important determinant of exercise tolerance. The ability of the muscle vasculature to dilate is markedly impaired, in part, because of exaggerated neurohumoral activity increasing vascular wall stiffness. For this reason, increasing cardiac output is not sufficient to increase exercise capacity if not accompanied by improving vascular reactivity. The poor reliability and reproducibility of exercise tolerance assessed by maximal exercise duration or maximal attained work load (particularly on a treadmill) has led to widespread measurement of respiratory gas during exercise. Peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2), even if it is symptom-limited, has been shown to be a very reproducible criterion of exercise tolerance; moreover, because VO2 is the product of cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen difference, it also has a qualitative hemodynamic significance. Ventilatory threshold can be determined before maximal exercise; however, problems of determination limit the practical value of this criterion. Unfortunately, peak VO2 lacks sensitivity to detect minor improvement or impairment of symptoms during daily life, although these are significant to the patient. Submaximal exercises have been proposed for this purpose and are currently being evaluated. \nPercutaneous balloon pericardial window for patients with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade. We performed percutaneous balloon pericardial window (PBPW) in 8 patients (age 40 to 70 yrs; 4 men, 4 women) with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade. Pericardial window was indicated because they continued to drain greater than 100 ml/day of pericardial fluid through the pigtail catheter for greater than or equal to 3 days. A 0.038 inch guidewire was advanced through the pigtail catheter into the pericardial space and then the catheter was removed. A 20 mm diameter, 3 cm long balloon dilating catheter was advanced to straddle the parietal pericardium. Manual inflations were performed until the waist produced by the pericardium disappeared. All patients tolerated the procedure well with minimal discomfort and with no complications. A left or bilateral pleural effusion occurred in all patients after PBPW. No patient developed recurrent pericardial tamponade at a mean follow-up of 6 +/- 2 months. Thus, PBPW is a useful and safe technique to avoid surgery in patients with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade. \nThree-dimensional x-ray computed tomography of the temporal bone as an aid to surgical planning. Three-dimensional x-ray computed tomography (3DCT) has been useful in planning surgical procedures involving craniofacial reconstruction, the pelvis, hip, spine, knee and shoulder. The clinical use of 3DCT in temporal bone surgery has not been evaluated. We used 3DCT to assess temporal bone anatomy in 9 patients. These cases evaluated two encephaloceles, two postinflammatory dehiscences, two temporal bone fractures, one glomus jugulare tumor, one acoustic neuroma, and one meningioma. We found 3DCT useful in these temporal bone applications as a supplement to standard two-dimensional CT scanning (2DCT). While 3DCT provided a better preoperative understanding of the underlying anatomy, no treatment was modified solely on the basis of the information derived from the 3-D presentation of data. We conclude that, although 3DCT images have some qualitative advantages over 2DCT techniques, their value in further defining temporal bone morphology must be evaluated against the cost entailed by their use. \nThe analgesic effects of caffeine in headache. Caffeine is frequently added to mild analgesic preparations but its effect when used alone on pain has never been studied in humans. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled multiple crossover design, 53 patients with non-migrainous headaches were given placebo, acetaminophen, 2 doses of caffeine and 2 combinations of caffeine with acetaminophen. Caffeine appeared to have independent analgesic effects that were equivalent to acetaminophen and were still significant when statistical adjustments were made for prior caffeine consumption and caffeine's effects on mood. \nMolecular biology of prion diseases. Prions cause transmissible and genetic neurodegenerative diseases, including scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy of animals and Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker diseases of humans. Infectious prion particles are composed largely, if not entirely, of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein, which is encoded by a chromosomal gene. A posttranslational process, as yet unidentified, converts the cellular prion protein into an abnormal isoform. Scrapie incubation times, neuropathology, and prion synthesis in transgenic mice are controlled by the prion protein gene. Point mutations in the prion protein genes of animals and humans are genetically linked to development of neuro-degeneration. Transgenic mice expressing mutant prion proteins spontaneously develop neurologic dysfunction and spongiform neuropathology. Understanding prion diseases may advance investigations of other neurodegenerative disorders and of the processes by which neurons differentiate, function for decades, and then grow senescent. \nAnterior transpetrosal-transtentorial approach for sphenopetroclival meningiomas: surgical method and results in 10 patients. This report presents a new surgical method and the results in 10 patients with petroclival meningiomas extending into the parasellar region (sphenopetroclival meningiomas). Minimal but effective extradural resection of the anterior petrous bone via a middle fossa craniotomy offered a direct view of the clival area with preservation of the temporal bridging veins and cochlear organs. The dural incision was extended anteriorly to Meckel's cave, and in cases with invasion of the cavernous sinus, Parkinson's triangle was enlarged by mobilization of the trigeminal nerve. This approach offered an excellent view from the mid-clivus to the cavernous sinus. Extra-as well as intradural tumor masses and dural attachments could be cleared under direct view of the pontine surface. The risk of injury to the lower cranial nerve and of retraction damage to the temporal lobe and brain stem were kept minimal by this approach. Total tumor resection was achieved in 7 patients, with no resultant mortality. Eight patients had a satisfactory postsurgical course, extraocular paresis being their main complaint. The extent of tumor resection depended on the degree of tumor adhesion to the carotid artery, and operative morbidity on the degree of tumor invasion of the brain stem. Of the 3 patients in whom subtotal tumor removal was achieved, only one experienced regrowth of the tumor and underwent a second operation during the follow-up period (6 months-6 years). \nNative right atrial tamponade with the Jarvik total artificial heart. Following a massive myocardial infarction culminating in cardiogenic shock, a 61-year-old man underwent implantation of the Jarvik 70-ml total artificial heart. On the fifth postoperative day, hemodynamic instability coupled with subtle radiographic changes and impaired mechanical right ventricular diastolic inflow were instrumental in establishing the diagnosis of localized native right atrial tamponade. To our knowledge, this report is the first detailed discussion of this phenomenon. \nHigh density lipoprotein turnover in patients with hypertension. Although hyperinsulinemia and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration can occur in patients with hypertension, there is no information available concerning the dynamic state of high density lipoprotein metabolism. To address this issue, we quantified high density lipoprotein turnover in 12 patients with mild hypertension and 11 matched subjects with normal blood pressure. Patients with high blood pressure had lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Fractional catabolic rates of 125I-apolipoprotein AI (apoAI)/high density lipoprotein were faster in patients with hypertension (0.36 +/- 0.02 versus 0.26 +/- 0.02 l/day, p less than 0.001). Total synthetic rates of apoAI were also significantly greater in patients with high blood pressure (17.4 +/- 1.1 versus 13.2 +/- 0.6 mg/kg/day, p less than 0.001). Although significant correlation was observed between blood pressure and fractional catabolic rate of 125I-apoAI/high density lipoprotein in the experimental population (r = 0.52, p less than 0.01), no relation was found when patients with normal blood pressure or hypertension were considered separately. However, a highly significant positive correlation was found between 125I-apoAI/high density lipoprotein fractional catabolic rate and insulin concentration in the entire population (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001). In conclusion, the patients with mild hypertension studied were hyperinsulinemic, had a faster fractional catabolic rate of 125I-apoAI/high density lipoprotein, and a lower high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration. It is suggested that the changes seen in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration and 125I-apoAI/high density lipoprotein fractional catabolic rates were secondary to the hyperinsulinemia and not due to the high blood pressure per se. \nCold-induced brain edema and infarction are reduced in transgenic mice overexpressing CuZn-superoxide dismutase. It has been proposed that oxygen-derived radicals, superoxide in particular, are involved in the alteration of blood-brain barrier permeability and the pathogenesis of brain edema following trauma, ischemia, and reperfusion injury. Using transgenic mice that overexpress the human gene for copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase, we studied the role of superoxide radicals in the blood-brain permeability changes, edema development, and delayed infarction resulting from cold-trauma brain injury. At 2 hours after a 30-second cold injury, cerebral water and Evans blue contents were reduced, respectively, from 80 +/- 0.2% and 132.7 +/- 12.9 micrograms/gm of dry weight for nontransgenic mice to 78.5 +/- 0.3% and 87.1 +/- 9.9 micrograms/gm of dry weight for transgenic mice. Infarction, as measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, was reduced by 52% in transgenic brains. These data indicate that an increased level of superoxide dismutase activity in the brain reduces the development of vasogenic brain edema and infarction. Superoxide radicals play an important role in the pathogenesis of these lesions in cold-traumatized brain. \nConstitutive expression and role in growth regulation of interleukin-1 and multiple cytokine receptors in a biphenotypic leukemic cell line. A cell line (B1) was established from the bone marrow of a patient with a relapse of acute leukemia characterized by a 4;11 chromosomal translocation and biphenotypic features of early B and myeloid lineages. Analysis of the growth requirements of this cell line showed density-dependent growth and secretion of an autostimulatory growth factor, suggesting an autocrine mechanism. Several lines of evidence implicate the participation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the autocrine growth regulation of B1 cells. These cells constitutively express the messenger RNA (mRNA) for IL-1 and IL-1 receptor and secrete IL-1; recombinant IL-1 stimulated the growth of colonies when cells were seeded at low density, and anti-IL-1 antibodies inhibited the growth of colonies with cells seeded at higher density. B1 cells do not express detectable levels of mRNA for any of the other cytokines tested, and other cytokines failed to support the growth of B1 cells at low density. In addition, B1 cells express multiple cytokine receptor genes, including the receptors for IL-6, IL-7, tumor necrosis factor and gamma-interferon. Addition of the respective cytokines to the B1 cells resulted in inhibition of the growth of leukemic cells in vitro. The multiplicity of growth-inhibitory cytokine receptors on this leukemic cell line might be due to its biphenotypic lineage and may suggest new therapeutic possibilities in controlling leukemic cell proliferation. \nTechnical considerations for prophylactic mastectomy in patients at high risk for breast cancer. A study of 5 patients and 10 mastectomy specimens was performed to identify the extent of surgery necessary to completely remove all breast tissue in patients having prophylactic mastectomies. A standard total mastectomy performed for breast cancer was shown to frequently leave breast tissue within the superficial pectoralis major muscle and the lower skin flap. Frozen section analysis of margins was found to be essential to clear the axillary extension of the breast and lower skin flap in particular. The value of more extensive surgery to remove all glandular elements of the breast in the high-risk patient remains to be demonstrated. \nAutomated procedure for dewaxing and rehydration of paraffin-embedded tissue sections for DNA flow cytometric analysis of breast tumors. Flow cytometric DNA analysis of paraffin-embedded tumors is an important diagnostic and prognostic tool in clinical pathology. The technique is limited, however, by the time-consuming multistep procedure for dewaxing and rehydrating tissue. The authors developed an automated procedure to complete the dewaxing and rehydration of tissue using a routine histologic tissue processor with a 24-hour timer. This technique provided excellent tissue recovery and reproducible DNA histograms comparable to those obtained by manual methods. Subsequently, the authors analyzed the DNA content of 93 paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues. The automation of a significant portion of the routine processing required for paraffin-embedded tissue makes cytometric DNA analysis a more practical procedure in the laboratory. \nLate complications involving the ascending aorta after cardiac surgery: recognition and management. Pseudoaneurysms and dissecting aneurysms of the ascending aorta after cardiac surgery are uncommon but important complications. Pseudoaneurysms, which result from extravasation of blood into the mediastinum, most commonly occur at the site of aortotomy or aortic cannulation. Infection may play an important role. Dissecting aneurysms after cardiac surgery usually occur at the site of aortic incision or cross clamping, especially in atherosclerotic aortas. Both conditions may be clinically silent but more frequently are seen with significant symptoms. Noninvasive techniques including CT scan, MRI, and echocardiography are very useful in the diagnosis of both complications, with contrast aortography remaining the definitive method. Surgical repair is necessary for dissecting aneurysms and for enlarging and symptomatic pseudoaneurysms, with improving morbidity and mortality. \nRecurrence of hepatitis C virus infection after orthotopic liver transplantation. Identification of the hepatitis C virus--the main cause of posttransfusion and sporadic non-A, non-B hepatitis--and the development of a diagnostic serological test have allowed us to study possible recurrence of this type of hepatitis after liver transplantation. Six of 34 consecutive transplant recipients were found to have had antibodies to hepatitis C before transplantation. All six patients had possible exposure to hepatitis C through blood transfusion or intravenous drug use. Five of the six patients were positive for antibodies to hepatitis C after 1 yr of follow-up. Two of these patients had clinical and histological evidence of acute viral hepatitis in their allografts. In one patient this led to hepatic injury and dysfunction of two successive grafts. In contrast, none of the twenty-eight patients who were seronegative for hepatitis C virus antibodies before transplantation has converted to seropositivity after transplantation despite perioperative blood transfusions. These results suggest that hepatitis C diagnosed serologically recurs in a minority of transplant recipients and that de novo seroconversion must be uncommon. \nNutritional aspects and swallowing function of patients with Parkinson's disease. Seven patients with Parkinson's disease and three patients with progressive supranuclear palsy underwent adrenal medullary transplant to the caudate nucleus for treatment of their neurologic disease. Preoperative nutritional assessment demonstrated that a significant number of the Parkinson's patients had mild to moderate nutritional depletion. Motility problems, manifest by dysphagia and delayed gastric emptying causing problems over a number of years, were probably responsible. Of the 10 patients studied, 6 were studied by videofluoroscopy. All patients had variable dysphagia of variable servility with or without aspiration. Etiologic factors included the basic underlying neurologic disease, delay in resumption of anti-parkinsonian medications, use of metoclopramide, and postoperative medical complications leading to a debilitated clinical state. \nAcute basophilic leukemia. A clinical, morphologic, and cytogenetic study of eight cases. The authors describe eight cases of acute basophilic leukemia. In six of the eight cases, basophilic involvement was not apparent by light microscopic examination. The cases were identified on the basis of ultrastructural evidence for basophil/mast cell differentiation of the blasts with little or no differentiation into other lineages. Ultrastructural analysis revealed immature basophil granules in blasts in all eight cases and theta granules in blasts in four cases. In three cases, ultrastructural evidence of mast cell differentiation also was present, with rare cells showing evidence for both basophil and mast cell differentiation. No clinical features distinguished this group of patients from others with acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetically, the cases were heterogeneous. Three had a Philadelphia chromosome; none had a t(6;9). The authors conclude that ultrastructural analysis usually must be used to diagnose acute basophilic leukemia, that acute basophilic leukemia is associated frequently with the Philadelphia chromosome, and that the ultrastructural findings provide evidence for a common origin of basophils and mast cells. \nAutoimmune enteropathy and nephropathy with circulating anti-epithelial cell antibodies. We describe a child with circulating anti-epithelial cell antibodies, autoimmune enteropathy with intestinal villous atrophy, and membranous glomerulonephritis. The patient had persistent diarrhea at 6 months of age, and a small bowel biopsy showed active enteritis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. When the patient was, 10 months of age, nephrotic syndrome developed because of membranous glomerulonephritis. Results of tests for circulating immune complexes were negative. Indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed a circulating antibody directed against renal epithelial cells. Circulating antibodies directed against normal small intestine epithelial cells were also detected by the immunoperoxidase technique. Western blot and immunoprecipitation identified a 55-kd antigen, in both small bowel and kidney, that reacted with an antibody in the patient's serum. High-dose prednisone therapy induced a clinical remission, resolution of the small bowel injury, and diminished serum anti-epithelial cell antibodies; after dose reduction, clinical relapse occurred with villous atrophy and reappearance of anti-epithelial cell antibodies. When the patient was 45 months of age, persistent diarrhea recurred despite intravenous administration of corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and total parenteral nutrition. Autoantibodies to a 55-kd epithelial cell protein are temporally related to the development of enteropathy and nephropathy. Study of similar patients is needed to determine the role of such antibodies in this disorder. \nBurning pain in an extremity. Breaking the destructive cycle of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. The pathogenesis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy is controversial, but the condition can result from a major or seemingly minor injury to a limb, or even an insult to an organ, such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Onset can be sudden or insidious. The syndrome is characterized primarily by localized, deep, burning pain in a limb--pain that may not follow any logical distribution. Nonpitting edema, skin hyperesthesia, and guarding of the limb usually accompany the pain. If treatment is not instituted, deformity, contracture, and wasting of the limb can eventually occur. With appropriate therapy, the process can be stopped and often reversed. The keys are a high index of suspicion, early diagnosis, and aggressive treatment. \nEffects of nitroglycerin and diltiazem on well-developed coronary collateral circulation in conscious dogs. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of nitroglycerin and diltiazem on coronary collateral circulation. Studies were conducted in 8 conscious dogs instrumented for the measurement of left circumflex coronary artery (LCCA) flow, subendocardial segment lengths in areas perfused by the LCCA, and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Brief, repeated LCCA occlusions sufficiently developed collateral vessels for the resting metabolic requirement in the LCCA region. One week following the cessation of repeated LCCA occlusions, two-minute coronary occlusions with and without drug pretreatment were performed on separate days. The ischemic responses to coronary occlusions were not altered by diltiazem (50 micrograms/kg, IV), but nitroglycerin (5 micrograms/kg, IV) attenuated myocardial ischemia definitely. The authors conclude that nitroglycerin produces greater effects than diltiazem in attenuating myocardial ischemia in the collateral dependent zone when effects of each drug on systemic and coronary circulation were minimized by pretreatment with small doses. \nComparative evaluation of carcinoembryonic antigen, secretory component, and mucins in index and metachronous adenomas of the colorectum. Of 124 patients who underwent endoscopic polypectomy, 70 were colonoscopically reevaluated during a mean period of 10 years. On the basis of the clinical outcome, the patients were divided into three groups: group 1, 31 patients who had a colon still with no adenomas or cancer; group 2, 35 patients in whom one or more metachronous adenomatous polyps developed; and group 3, 4 patients in whom a carcinoma of the colon subsequently developed. In addition to the clinical and pathological features, the pattern of the immunohistologic staining for carcinoembryonic antigen and secretory component was studied. Moreover, the mucin histochemical staining intensity of neutral mucins, sulfomucins, and sialomucins was evaluated. The features of the 40 index adenomas obtained from patients in group 1 were compared with the features of the 51 index adenomas from patients in group 2. Furthermore, these characteristics of the index adenomas were compared with those in the 69 metachronous adenomas of the group 2 patients. It was found that male sex (P less than 0.005) and a history of colorectal neoplasia (P less than 0.02) are main factors for the development of new adenomas. The neutral mucins were less abundant in the group 2 index adenomas (r = -0.21; P less than 0.05). The expression of the other evaluated markers was not significantly different between both groups, although the group 2 index adenomas were significantly smaller (r = -0.22; P less than 0.05) and showed a trend toward a more pronounced cytoplasmic expression of carcinoembryonic antigen than the index adenomas from group 1 (22% vs. 12.5%). Moreover, it was found that in comparison with the index adenomas, metachronous adenomas were significantly smaller (r = -0.24; P less than 0.01) and more sessile (r = 0.20; P less than 0.002). Significant negative correlations, i.e., decrease, were also found in the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (surface P less than 0.001; cytoplasmic P less than 0.05) and neutral mucins (P less than 0.005) between the index adenomas and the metachronous adenomas, whereas positive correlations were found for secretory component (P = 0.0001) and sulfomucins (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that a limited production of neutral mucins in the goblet cells of a small index adenoma from a male patient with a history of colorectal neoplasia is indicative of an increased risk for the development of new colorectal adenomas. Furthermore, the clinical, mucin histochemical, and immunohistochemical findings of the metachronous adenomas show less malignancy-associated features than those of the index adenomas. \nComparison of enteral nutrition and drug treatment in active Crohn's disease. Results of the European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study. IV This study compared the effect of enteral nutrition as the sole therapy of active Crohn's disease with drug treatment. Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 200) were randomized to receive either enteral nutrition with a liquid oligopeptide diet (n = 55) or a combination of 6-methylprednisolone, 48 mg daily, subsequently tapered, and sulfasalazine, 3 g daily (n = 52). The two groups were not different with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, or treatment before the study. The severity of disease was similar at the beginning of the study in both groups [Crohn's Disease Activity Index (mean +/- SEM), 323 +/- 12 vs. 316 +/- 11]. Remission was defined as a decrease of the initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index by 40% or at least 100 points. Twenty-nine patients in the diet group and 41 patients in the drug group reached remission within 6 weeks of therapy (chi 2 test, P less than 0.01). The median elapsed time to remission was 30.7 days in the diet group compared with 8.2 days in the drug group (Mantel Cox, P less than 0.01). To determine whether one of these treatments was more beneficial for a subgroup of patients, the effectiveness of both treatments was analyzed separately in patients with very severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 300) and less severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index less than 300), and in patients with different disease location. However, no influence of initial disease activity or disease location on the effect of either treatment could be shown. These data show that enteral nutrition is less effective than a combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine in treating active Crohn's disease. \nAbnormalities of pathways of fibrin turnover in the human pleural space. The potential importance of pleural fibrin deposition in the pathogenesis of pleural injury is supported by both clinical and experimental observations. We hypothesized that the local equilibrium between procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities is disrupted to favor fibrin deposition in exudative pleuritis. To test this hypothesis, we characterized procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities in pleural exudates from patients with pneumonia, lung cancer, or empyema and transudates from patients with congestive heart failure. Procoagulant activity was generally increased in exudative processes and was due mainly to tissue factor. All effusions contained antithrombin III and inhibited factor Xa and thrombin, but endogenous prothrombinase or thrombin activities were variably detected. Pleural fluid fibrinolytic activity was increased in congestive heart failure and was due to both tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase. Depressed fibrinolytic activity was found in pleural exudates despite increased concentrations of plasminogen, mainly glu-1-plasminogen, and was due to inhibition of plasminogen activation by plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 and 2 and of plasmin, in part by alpha 2-antiplasmin. Concentrations of PAI-1 in exudative pleural fluids were increased up to 913-fold, compared with normal pooled plasma. Exudative pleural effusions are characterized by increased procoagulant and depressed fibrinolytic activity, favoring fibrin deposition in the pleural space. The balance of these activities is reversed and favors fibrin clearance in congestive heart failure. \nAdenine arabinoside monophosphate and acyclovir monophosphate coupled to lactosaminated albumin reduce woodchuck hepatitis virus viremia at doses lower than do the unconjugated drugs. The woodchuck was selected to study the efficacy of liver-targeted antiviral drugs on hepadnavirus replication. Nineteen woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus were treated with adenine arabinoside monophosphate or acyclovir monophosphate, either free or conjugated with the liver-targeting molecule lactosaminated human serum albumin. Circulating woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA levels remained unchanged in untreated animals and in those receiving the carrier lactosaminated human serum albumin alone; in contrast, they were consistently lower after 5 days of treatment with the antiviral drugs. Free and conjugated adenine arabinoside monophosphate were active at doses of 10 and 0.75 mg/kg, respectively, and free and coupled ACVMP were active at doses of 20 and 2.6 mg/kg, respectively. These results indicate that the dosages of adenine arabinoside monophosphate and acyclovir monophosphate required to inhibit hepadnavirus growth can be sharply reduced by coupling the drugs to lactosaminated human serum albumin. \nThe epidemiologic importance of dysentery in communities. This paper explores the epidemiologic importance of dysentery with use of several community studies that demonstrate its prevalence and incidence as well as its association with pathogens, nutritional status, persistent diarrhea, and death. Results of these studies showed that while watery diarrhea was most prevalent in children aged 6-11 months, the prevalence of dysentery peaked between 18 and 23 months of age. Severely stunted children were found to have significantly prolonged episodes of dysentery. Shigella and persistent diarrhea were more frequent in children with dysentery than in those with nonbloody diarrhea. A striking feature was that watery diarrhea, dysentery, persistent diarrhea, and malnutrition each account for less than 5% of all deaths among children aged less than 5 years. However, persistent diarrhea in association with malnutrition causes 13% of deaths in children aged 0-4 years and 27% of deaths in those aged 1-4 years. These data suggest that a more balanced strategy for diarrheal control is required simply because most diarrheal deaths occur among malnourished children with prolonged diarrhea, which is mainly due to dysentery. Results of the studies also suggest that methods to control dysentery in the community should focus on improved hygiene and antimicrobial treatment with use of appropriate algorithms. Recognition of the synergism between dysentery and persistent diarrhea accompanied by malnutrition is crucial in formulating effective programs for control of diarrhea. \nThe significance of portal vein thrombosis after distal splenorenal shunt. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of portal vein thrombosis after the distal splenorenal shunt, to identify any predictive factors, and to assess the clinical significance of this complication. Preoperative and postoperative angiograms and clinical evaluation were reviewed in 124 patients who underwent distal splenorenal shunts. Total and partial portal vein thrombosis were seen on 13 (10.5%) and 22 (17.7%) postoperative angiograms, respectively. The only preoperative variable correlating with development of portal vein thrombosis was portal venous perfusion, which was significantly lower in patients with than in those without portal vein thrombosis. In six of 10 patients with postoperative pancreatitis, portal vein thrombosis developed. The frequency of early postoperative complications was significantly greater in patients with total portal vein thrombosis than in those with partial or no thrombosis. Long-term follow-up has shown no significant effects of portal vein thrombosis on late ascites, encephalopathy, or survival. \nChronic calcific pancreatitis in a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. We report on a patient with chronic calcific pancreatitis associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and we have hypothesized a possible relationship between these two entities. The hyperviscosity of serum in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia may be associated with a viscous pancreatic juice that leads to stone formation. \nComparative aspects of osteosarcoma. Dog versus man. Canine osteosarcoma bears striking resemblance to osteosarcoma in humans. Similarities include the following: male sex predilection, large patient size, 75% or more affecting the appendicular site, metaphyseal location, generally unknown etiology, less than 10% of patients have documented metastasis at presentation, over 90% of tumors show high-grade histology, 75% of tumors show aneuploidy, the metastatic rate is 80% or more with amputation alone, the lung is the most common site of metastasis, and there is improved survival with adjuvant chemotherapy. The major differences are age of onset, with dogs being affected in middle age; greater frequency in the dog, with over 8000 new cases per year; and time to metastasis being faster in the dog than man. Canine osteosarcoma is a readily available and highly comparable spontaneously occurring cancer that should be useful in a better understanding of the same disease in humans. \nEffect of weight loss on upper airway collapsibility in obstructive sleep apnea. Previous investigators have demonstrated in patients with obstructive sleep apnea that weight reduction results in a decrease in apnea severity. Although the mechanism for this decrease is not clear, we hypothesize that decreases in upper airway collapsibility account for decreases in apnea severity with weight loss. To determine whether weight loss causes decreases in collapsibility, we measured the upper airway critical pressure (Pcrit) before and after a 17.4 +/- 3.4% (mean +/- SD) reduction in body mass index in 13 patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Thirteen weight-stable control subjects matched for age, body mass index, gender (all men), and non-REM disordered breathing rate (DBR) also were studied before and after usual care intervention. During non-REM sleep, maximal inspiratory airflow was measured by varying the level of nasal pressure and Pcrit was determined by the level of nasal pressure below which maximal inspiratory airflow ceased. In the weight loss group, a significant decrease in DBR from 83.3 +/- 31.0 to 32.5 +/- 35.9 episodes/h and in Pcrit from 3.1 +/- 4.2 to -2.4 +/- 4.4 cm H2O (p less than 0.00001) was demonstrated. Moreover, decreases in Pcrit were associated with nearly complete elimination of apnea in each patient whose Pcrit fell below -4 cm H2O. In contrast, no significant change in DBR and a minimal reduction in Pcrit from 5.2 +/- 2.3 to 4.2 +/- 1.8 cm H2O (p = 0.031) was observed in the \"usual care\" group. We conclude that (1) weight loss is associated with decreases in upper airway collapsibility in obstructive sleep apnea, and that (2) the resolution of sleep apnea depends on the absolute level to which Pcrit falls. \nCavernomas of the central nervous system: clinical and neuroimaging manifestations in 47 patients. Forty seven cases of central nervous system cavernous angioma (21 males and 26 females) are described. The main clinical signs were epilepsy and brainstem syndromes. Digital subtraction intra-arterial angiography, when used, failed to reveal cavernoma. CT detected many of the lesions, but the most successful supplementary diagnostic procedure was MRI which produces highly characteristic images of cavernous angioma. The diagnosis of cavernous angioma was confirmed in the 18 cases in which the tumour was removed surgically. \nUpper airway collapsibility in snorers and in patients with obstructive hypopnea and apnea. During sleep, mild reduction in inspiratory airflow is associated with snoring, whereas obstructive hypopneas and apneas are associated with more marked reductions in airflow. We determined whether the degree of inspiratory airflow reduction was associated with differences in the collapsibility of the upper airway during sleep. Upper airway collapsibility was defined by the critical pressure (Pcrit) derived from the relationship between maximal inspiratory airflow and nasal pressure. In 10 asymptomatic snorers, six patients with obstructive hypopneas, and 10 patients with obstructive apneas, during nonrapid eye movement sleep, Pcrit ranged from -6.5 +/- 2.7 cm H2O to -1.6 +/- 1.4 and 2.5 +/- 1.5 cm H2O, respectively (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.001). Moreover, higher levels of Pcrit were associated with lower levels of maximal inspiratory airflow during tidal breathing during sleep (p less than 0.005). We conclude that differences in upper airway collapsibility distinguish among groups of normal subjects who snore and patients with periodic hypopneas and apneas. Moreover, the findings suggest that small differences in collapsibility (Pcrit) along a continuum are associated with reduced airflow and altered changes in pattern of breathing. \nAdhesiolysis. Lysis of adhesions improves pregnancy rates. Results of laparoscopic lysis are not different from those of laparotomy. Since laparoscopy is more convenient to the patient, less expensive, saves hospital beds, and involves low morbidity, it should be the preferred surgical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic adhesions whenever possible. The use of a sharp dissection combined with electrocautery seems, at this time, to be equally effective to the use of lasers of different kinds. Adjuvants presently available, especially Hyskon or INTERCEED, have an added benefit to surgery alone. Even with the best surgical technique, adhesions tend to re-form. Although SLL will identify the extent of adhesion re-formation, the therapeutic advantage of lysing re-formed adhesions is yet to be proved. \nCoronary artery stenting after angioplasty with self-expanding parallel wire metallic stents. Parallel wire stents were implanted over exchange guide wires at percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty sites in 27 canine coronary arteries that were predilated with slightly oversized balloons. Stents were stainless steel, self-expandable, 3.5 to 4.5 mm in diameter, 9 to 12 mm in length, and were made of 10 wires that were longitudinally laser-welded in a zig-zag design. The compressible stent was delivered by the withdrawal of a Teflon outer catheter (4.2 to 4.9F) and the push of a polyethylene inner catheter. Aspirin, 80 mg per day, was given from the day before the study began, and heparin (150 U/kg) was administered during implantation. Quantitative angiography and pathologic examinations were performed at day 0 and at weeks 2, 4, 12, 26 and 52. The coronary angiographic diameter at the stent site immediately after stenting marginally increased from diameter before stenting: 3.22 +/- 0.40 mm versus 3.14 +/- 0.37 mm (p = 0.03), and during a mean of 14 weeks of follow-up, remained unaltered from immediate post-stenting: 3.29 +/- 0.43 mm versus 3.22 +/- 0.40 mm (p = NS) with no stent displacement. Comparisons of patency and thrombosis between heparin-coated and uncoated stents, between left anterior descending and circumflex arteries, and among the three different diameters of stents showed uniformly good results. At microscopy, the wires were oriented perfectly and embedded in the arterial wall, and by 2 weeks they were covered by mucopolysaccharide ground substance, smooth muscle cells, and an almost complete monolayer of neoendothelial cells. \nEight-year outcome in infants with birth weight of 500 to 999 grams: continuing regional study of 1979 and 1980 births. Victorian Infant Collaborative Study Group. The outcome at a mean age of 8.3 years was determined for 88 of 89 surviving children with birth weights of 500 to 999 gm who were born in Victoria in 1979 and 1980; the condition of the untraced child, severely disabled at 5 years of age, was assumed to be unchanged at 8 years. Principal impairments in the children at 8 years of age were cerebral palsy 8 (9%); bilateral blindness 6 (6.7%) and poor vision in another 4 (4.5%); bilateral deafness requiring amplification 5 (5.6%); and epilepsy 2 (2.2%). The Full Scale score of the Weschler Intelligence Scales for Children--Revised was available for 77 children: 5 scores (6.5%) were less than 71 (low IQ), and 9 (11.7%) were between 71 and 85 (borderline IQ). Severe disability in 16 children (18%) was due to severe cerebral palsy, bilateral blindness, or low IQ. Mild or moderate disability was present in another 18 children (20.2%) with borderline IQ, mild or moderate cerebral palsy, poor vision, deafness, or epilepsy. Significantly more outborn children (10/18, 55.6%) than inborn children (24/71, 33.8%) were disabled. Ten children required special schooling; reading accuracy or comprehension was at least 18 months behind chronologic age in 17 (23%) of 75 children in normal school who were tested. The 2-year assessment correctly estimated the category of disability at 8 years of age in 55 (62%), overestimated it in 24 (27%), and underestimated it in 10 (11%). For the 82 children also seen at 5 years age, the category of disability at 8 years of age was correctly identified in 69 children (84%), overestimated in 4 (5%), and underestimated in 9 (11%). Change in psychologic test scores was the principal reason for reclassifying children. We conclude that the 2-yar assessment was valuable in the early identification of most of the severely disabled children, but developmental delay at 2 years of age did not always portend intellectual impairment at 8 years of age. \nSun protection in childhood. There is compelling evidence that childhood is a particularly vulnerable time for the photocarcinogenic effects of sun exposure on the skin. Studies indicate that excessive sun exposure during the first 10-20 years of life greatly increases the risk of skin cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) has been associated with cumulative sun exposure, whereas melanoma has been associated with short, intense sun exposure or blistering sunburn. Under normal circumstances, children receive three times the annual sun exposure of adults; most of one's lifetime sun exposure occurs in childhood. Depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer adds to the photodamage problem. It is clear that sun protection is most vital in the early years. Those with fair skin are at highest risk. Photoprotective measures including sunscreen, clothing, and sun avoidance in childhood may significantly reduce the occurrence of melanoma and other skin cancer in later life. Regular use of sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 15 during the first 18 years of life could reduce the lifetime incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer by 78%. Pediatricians can play a major role in educating parents and children. \nSacrospinous fixation--should this be performed at the time of vaginal hysterectomy? A sensible individualized approach should be applied to every patient undergoing transvaginal surgery for benign disease. This approach should attempt to correct every defect present in the pelvic supports. Uterovaginal prolapse is the result rather than the cause of genital prolapse. Not every vaginal hysterectomy should be treated like a cystocele-rectocele repair. Instead, every defect of the endopelvic fascial support should be evaluated in a patient both before and during surgery. As a result of these evaluations, more than just a hysterectomy and an anterior and posterior colporrhaphy may be performed. In a case in which a patient is found to have more than one defect at the time of examination, sacrospinous fixation of the vaginal apex at the time of transvaginal hysterectomy may be indicated. In the office, the patient can be examined in the supine and standing positions, both with and without Valsalva's maneuver, to determine if moderate to severe uterovaginal prolapse exists. Sacrospinous fixation should be performed in those cases as an adjunct to other steps taken to prevent postthysterectomy prolapse. \nAnimal models for arterial thrombolysis and prevention of reocclusion. Erythrocyte-rich versus platelet-rich thrombus. Experimental animal models for erythrocyte-rich (ER) and platelet-rich (PR) arterial thrombosis were developed in dogs and rabbits and used for the evaluation of the effect of antithrombin and antiplatelet agents on thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activators (rt-PA). The canine models consist of a whole blood clot produced in the left anterior descending coronary artery (ER thrombus) or a 1-cm everted (inside-out) segment graft in the circumflex coronary artery that predisposes to occlusion with PR material (PR thrombus). The rabbit models consist of a femoral arterial whole blood clot (ER thrombus) or a femoral arterial eversion graft (PR thrombus). The whole blood clot models are sensitive to recanalization with rt-PA but are consistently associated with reocclusion, notwithstanding the concomitant use of heparin and/or aspirin. Clot lysis is accelerated and reocclusion is prevented by the administration of F(ab')2 fragments of a monoclonal antibody 7E3 directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor; of Argatroban, a synthetic thrombin inhibitor; or of kistrin, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-blocking polypeptide from the Malayan pit viper venom. The PR thrombus models are very resistant to recanalization with rt-PA, but this resistance can be overcome by the concomitant use of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-blocking antibody. Thus, selective platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are more effective than aspirin, heparin, or both in accelerating arterial thrombolysis with rt-PA; in preventing reocclusion after clot lysis; and in overcoming the resistance of PR thrombus to dispersion with rt-PA. These experimental animal models may be useful in the development of improved thrombolytic strategies using plasminogen activators in conjunction with specifically targeted antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents. \nIs fiber mitochondrial volume density a good indicator of muscle fatigability to isometric exercise? The relationship between the ratio of interfibrillar mitochondrial volume density (Vvmit) to myofibrillar volume density (Vvmyo) and isometric fatigue characteristics of the human triceps surae was determined in six bodybuilders, six endurance athletes, and six active controls before and after 16 wk of isometric training at 30 or 100% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in six sedentary subjects in a unilateral exercise model. Time to fatigue at 30% MVC was significantly less in sedentary subjects before training than in the other subject groups, but it was similar to the other groups posttraining. Stereological analyses of type I fibers indicated that Vvmit/Vvmyo was less in bodybuilders than in other subjects. Training at 30% MVC increased type I fiber Vvmit/Vvmyo of the soleus by 11% but did not affect the gastrocnemii. Training at 100% MVC did not alter Vvmit/Vvmyo in any muscle, nor was this ratio changed in type II fibers by either training program. Despite the morphological differences, both training protocols increased relative endurance, although greater fatigue resistance was seen after training at 30% MVC. Correlation analyses indicated that isometric endurance and improvements in muscle endurance by isometric exercise were not dependent on increasing interfibrillar Vvmit or Vvmit/Vvmyo in either fiber type. \nElectromechanical dissociation in newborns treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: an extreme form of cardiac stun syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To recognize cardiac stun syndrome and electromechanical dissociation in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and to define patients at risk. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary neonatal ICU. PATIENTS: Four newborn patients with cardiorespiratory failure who developed signs of cardiac stun syndrome and electromechanical dissociation early in the ECMO course. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Initially, these patients had metabolic acidosis, chest roentgenograms showing pulmonary granularity and moderate cardiomegaly, and symptoms of severe respiratory distress. Cardiac dysfunction was apparent after ECMO was begun, with poor perfusion, pale color, narrow pulse pressure, and tachycardia despite normovolemia. Within 1 to 2 hrs, electromechanical dissociation occurred manifested by the absence of pulse pressure, palpable pulse, cardiac sounds, and apical impulse while on 50% to 70% bypass. All patients survived. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received ECMO, calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and dobutamine. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cardiac stun syndrome have symptoms similar to severe respiratory distress syndrome, and may require ECMO support. In the ECMO patient, cardiac stun syndrome and electromechanical dissociation can be confused with low circuit volume, pneumothorax, or cardiac tamponade.",
