High levels of endogenous plasma catecholamines in patients with severe congestive heart failure induce a down-regulation of the myocardial beta-adrenoreceptors and thus cause adrenoreceptor agonists, such as dobutamine, to be less effective in the treatment of these patients. Phosphodiesterase III inhibitors work independent of adrenoreceptor activity and plasma catecholamine levels; thus these agents are likely to be more effective in the treatment of severe heart failure. The present study compares both the initial and late hemodynamic effects of dobutamine and milrinone during sequentially administered 24-hour infusions. Twenty patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class III, n = 4; New York Heart Association class IV, n = 16) were investigated. Dobutamine could be administered at the prescribed maximum dose of 15 micrograms/kg/min for 24 hours in only 15 of 20 patients. In three patients the dose was reduced or dobutamine infusion completely stopped because of a drug-related increase in heart rate greater than 140 beats/min. Another 2 of 20 patients showed no hemodynamic improvement over 3 hours at the maximum dose of 15 micrograms/kg/min. Dobutamine administration was also discontinued in these patients on account of the existing unfavorable hemodynamic condition, and therapy with intravenous milrinone was started. All 20 patients responded to milrinone without side effects, although comparison of the hemodynamic effects during a 24-hour infusion was possible in only 15 patients. The 15 patients studied over both observation periods experienced an increase in heart rate from 88.8 to 105.6 beats/min (+ 1 hour; p less than or equal to 0.001) when receiving dobutamine but had no increase with milrinone. Stroke volume increased during dobutamine infusion from 19.3 to 28.9 ml/m2 (+49.6%) after 1 hour and then fell continuously to 25.2 ml/m2 after 12 hours; during milrinone therapy, stroke volume increased from 18.8 to 31.2 ml/m2 (+66%; p less than or equal to 0.001) and remained at this level until the end of the infusion (30.2 ml/m2). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) decreased (p less than or equal to 0.001) immediately during milrinone therapy from 26.5 to 16.2 mm Hg after 30 minutes and stabilized at 20.1 mm Hg after 24 hours. During dobutamine infusion PCWP showed a delayed decrease from 27.8 to 19.0 mm Hg after 6 hours and subsequently rose to 22.7 mm Hg after 24 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nPrognostic indices of survival in patients supported with temporary devices (TAH, VAD). In an attempt to identify current indications and patient selection criteria for the use of mechanical circulatory support, we reviewed our experience in 83 patients who received a total artificial heart (TAH; n = 43), ventricular assist device (VAD) (n = 13), centrifugal pump (n = 17) or extracorporeal membrane oxigenation (ECMO) (n = 8) as a bridge to transplantation (Group I, n = 50) or for recovery from heart failure (Group II, n = 33). Comparing patients successfully transplanted (n = 20) or weaned (n = 9) who survived initial hospitalization, and those who died on mechanical support, there were no differences in preoperative renal, hepatic or pulmonary functions. Postoperative urinary output and bilirubin levels were the earliest variables affecting survival, and urinary output 24 hours after implant was discriminative in patients who survived (p less than 0.01). Age (above or below 40 years) and modality of terminal heart failure (acute versus chronic) were the most important factors affecting survival in the bridge to transplant group: 82% of young patients with acute decompensation were transplanted and 63% are long-term survivors while all patients over 40 years with chronic heart failure died on mechanical support (MS). In postcardiotomy patients, duration of cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) was significantly different comparing survivors with those who died in either bridge or recovery groups and all patients who had a CPB greater than 4 hours died on MS or after transplantation or weaning. In conclusion, preoperative indices indicating reversibility of multiple organ dysfunction remain to be identified. \nTwo closely linked Drosophila POU domain genes are expressed in neuroblasts and sensory elements. We have characterized two Drosophila POU genes designated dPOU-19 and dPOU-28. These genes are transcribed as 3.1- and 2.2-kilobase mRNAs, respectively, which accumulate maximally during the first 12 hr of embryogenesis. The mRNAs encode 601- and 475-amino acid deduced proteins; their POU domains are most related to those of the human OCT1 and OCT2. Both genes give similar nervous system expression patterns and map to an indistinguishable site at 33F on the cytological map. Transcription of the genes is first observed in the cellular blastoderm. In the course of embryonic development, expression is observed in the neuroectoderm, with subsets of neuroblasts in the procephalic and germband central nervous system as well as a subset of peripheral nervous system elements. The expression patterns of the two POU genes suggest a possible functional role for these putative transcription factors in neurogenesis and neurospecification. \n5-Hydroxtryptamine1D receptor agonism predicts antimigraine efficacy. The interactions of four abortive anti-migraine agents and four prophylactic anti-migraine agents with 5-HT1D receptors in bovine brain were analyzed using radioligand binding techniques and adenylate cyclase assays. In bovine caudate, the affinities of abortive anti-migraine agents (i.e. 5-hydroxytryptamine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan) for 5-HT1D receptors range from 4.0-34 nM while the affinities of prophylactic anti-migraine agents (i.e. methysergide, amitriptyline, (-)propranolol, verapamil) range from 46-11,000 nM. In adenylate cyclase studies in bovine substantia nigra, all four abortive anti-migraine agents dose-dependently inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, a biochemical effect mediated by 5-HT1D receptors. No agonist effect on cyclase activity is observed with the four prophylactic anti-migraine agents. These data support the hypothesis that abortive anti-migraine agents are 5-HT1D receptor agonists and that this effect may underlie their anti-migraine efficacy. \nSerum bioactive and immunoreactive luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in women with cycle abnormalities, with or without polycystic ovarian disease. Serum steroid, gonadotropin, and alpha-subunit levels were assessed in 35 women with cycle abnormalities [11 with and 24 without polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) according to strict clinical and biochemical criteria] and 8 regularly cycling women in the early (cycle day 3 or 4) and mid (cycle day 7 or 8) follicular phase. LH and FSH levels were estimated using two immunological techniques [RIA and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA)] and in vitro bioassays (BIO), using mouse Leydig cells and rat granulosa cells, respectively. In PCOD patients mean alpha-subunit, free androgen index [FAI; testosterone x 100/sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)], androstenedione, estrone, and estradiol (E2) were significantly elevated compared to levels in the early follicular phase of control cycles and non-PCOD patients. In addition, in PCOD patients mean IRMA-LH and RIA-LH levels were distinctly increased (2.8- to 3.6 fold, respectively; both comparisons, P less than 0.001) compared to control values, but in the same order of magnitude (1.3- to 1.4-fold increments) as that in non-PCOD patients. However, the median BIO-LH level in PCOD patients was 5.9-fold higher than that in non-PCOD patients and 4.0-fold higher than the BIO-LH in the early follicular phase of control women. Consequently, the median BIO/IRMA-LH ratio was 4.8-fold higher in PCOD patients compared to non-PCOD patients. In women with cycle abnormalities, individual BIO/IRMA-LH ratios correlated with BIO-LH (rs = 0.48), FAI (rs = 0.39), free estrogens (E2/SHBG ratios; rs = 0 0.47), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (rs = 0.60) concentrations. Mean IRMA-, RIA-, and BIO-FSH levels and BIO/IRMA-FSH ratios were not significantly different when various groups were compared. Although RIA- and IRMA-LH levels showed good correlation (rs = 0.88), RIA-LH levels were consistently higher, resulting in distinctly higher RIA-LH/FSH ratios (mean, 4.5) compared to IRMA-LH/FSH ratios (median, 1.8) in PCOD patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nSplenic vein aneurysm: MR appearance--a case report. A presumed pancreatic head mass by non-contrast CT examination, was proven to be a splenic vein aneurysm by enhanced CT, MRI, sonography and arteriography. Dangerous percutaneous aspiration was avoided. \nStudy of experimental pain measures and nociceptive reflex in chronic pain patients and normal subjects. This study evaluates (i) the effect of heterotopic chronic pain on various experimental pain measures, (ii) the relationship between experimental pain measures and chronic pain symptomatology assessment, and (iii) the influence of the various pain aetiologies on experimental pain measures. Fifty-three chronic pain patients were compared to 17 pain-free subjects with the following psychophysical and physiological indices: pain threshold (PTh), pain tolerance (PTol), verbal estimation of intensity and unpleasantness (intensity scale, IS; unpleasantness scale, US), threshold for intensity and unpleasantness (ITh and UTh), lower limb RIII nociceptive reflex (RIIITh and RIII frequency of occurrence). Chronic pain syndromes included neuropathic pain (n = 12), iodopathic pain (n = 12), myofascial syndromes (n = 9), headache (n = 9), and miscellaneous pain (n = 11). Chronic pain symptomatology was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS), a French MPQ adaptation (QDSA), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State Trait Inventory (STAI) and Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). No significant difference was observed between chronic pain patients and pain-free control groups and between patient subgroups for PTh, PTol and RIIITh. No significant correlation was found between experimental pain measures and clinical pain, anxiety or depression scores. However, the chronic pain patients had a higher threshold for unpleasantness and judged the suprathreshold stimuli significantly less intense and less unpleasant than the control group. These results are discussed in relation to diffuse noxious inhibitory controls and the adaptation level theory of chronic pain experience. \nNot all that moves is tardive dyskinesia. OBJECTIVE: Because tardive dyskinesia and spontaneous dyskinesia appear the same, it is difficult to determine whether an individual patient's abnormal movements are induced by medication or have developed spontaneously. Therefore, estimates of the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia that are based on observations not adjusted for spontaneous dyskinesia are inflated. In addition, age is thought to be an important risk factor in the development of both tardive and spontaneous dyskinesias. The authors estimate the prevalence of both disorders for specific age groups. METHOD: The authors reviewed nine reports on dyskinesia prevalence that included history of neuroleptic treatment and related prevalence to age. A rating of 2 or more on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale or an equivalent score on another scale was considered an indication of dyskinesia. If the subject had taken neuroleptics for more than 3 months, the movement disorder was classified as neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia; other dyskinesias were considered spontaneous. The prevalence of tardive dyskinesia was defined as the rate of neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia minus the rate of spontaneous dyskinesia. RESULTS: The true rate of tardive dyskinesia was below 20% for all age groups except 70-79 years. The correlation between the rate of neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia and the rate of spontaneous dyskinesia was low. CONCLUSIONS: After age 40 the prevalence of spontaneous dyskinesia is sufficiently high to conclude that many patients with diagnoses of tardive dyskinesia have abnormal movements attributable to causes other than neuroleptics. \nPrimary bile acid diarrhoea without an ileal carrier defect: quantification of active bile acid transport across the ileal brush border membrane. Unexplained bile acid malabsorption associated with diarrhoea that responds to cholestyramine was first described in 1973 but convincing evidence of the proposed mechanism--a defective active ileal bile acid transport--has never been substantiated. Active bile acid transport was quantified in vitro using brush border membrane vesicles prepared from terminal ileal biopsy specimens from 10 patients who fulfilled the criteria of idiopathic bile acid diarrhoea. They were recruited from 181 patients with bile acid malabsorption of various causes. Transport was quantified as in vitro Na+ dependent bile acid transport (INBAT), expressed as pmol taurocholate/mg brush border membrane protein/15 seconds, and in vitro Na+ dependent bile acid local transport capacity (INBALTC), expressed as pmol taurocholate/g ileal biopsy tissue/15 seconds. The lowest INBAT and INBALTC values in the 10 patients with idiopathic bile acid diarrhoea were well above the 10th centile values of a control group of 132 patients. Both INBAT (mean (range) 88 (30-136)) and INBALTC (158 (85-268)) values were significantly higher in the 10 patients than in the control group (INBAT: mean (range) 63 (1-244), INBALTC: mean (range) 98 (1-408)). Quantification of active ileal bile acid transport in these 10 patients with idiopathic bile acid malabsorption suggests that a genetic (carrier) defect is rare in adults. \nSignificance of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence after lumpectomy. Breast cancer treatment trials from the US National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project have established breast-conserving operations as a replacement for radical mastectomy (NSABP B-04), and have shown that in terms of survival free from distant disease there was no significant difference between lumpectomy, lumpectomy plus breast irradiation, and total mastectomy (NSABP B-06). 9-year follow-up data from B-06 are used here to address the issue of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR) and the development of distant disease, a question with important clinical and biological implications. A Cox regression model on fixed co-variates (ie, features such as tumour type or size present at surgery and not subsequently alterable) and on IBTR, which is time dependent and not fixed, revealed that the risk of distant disease was 3.41 times greater after adjustment for co-variates in patients in whom an IBTR developed. IBTR proved to be a powerful independent predictor of distant disease. However, it is a marker of risk for, not a cause of, distant metastasis. While mastectomy or breast irradiation following lumpectomy prevent expression of the marker they do not lower the risk of distant disease. These findings further justify the use of lumpectomy. \nUse of the argon-pumped tunable dye laser for port-wine stains in children. The authors reported previously a new technique using a low power argon-pumped tunable dye laser at a wave-length of 577nm (yellow light) to treat port-wine stains in adults. The authors report their results using this same technique as a form of treatment for 92 children with facial port-wine stains. \nHistological grading of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis: a new scoring system. A system of histological grading based on retrospective analysis of 239 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is presented. A new scoring system with 4 histological grades was used. The results of this study confirm previous reports that penile cancer is usually a highly (50%) or moderately (29%) differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Poorly differentiated carcinomas and cancers of other types are very rare. The new grading system was found to be practical and a correlation between histological grade, clinical findings and prognosis was established. Patients with grade 1 tumours had an exceptionally favourable prognosis, with more than 80% being long-term survivors; for these patients, treatment with delayed side effects should be avoided and new forms of treatment should be explored. \nLeft ventricular diastolic collapse. An echocardiographic sign of regional cardiac tamponade. BACKGROUND. Cardiac tamponade after cardiac surgical procedures is often associated with hemodynamically significant localized pericardial effusions. The localized collection of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period and the atypical presentation of cardiac tamponade limit the use of conventional clinical and echocardiographic signs usually seen with a circumferential pericardial effusion. Observation of left ventricular diastolic collapse in the echocardiogram of a patient with postoperative regional cardiac tamponade prompted us to explore the frequency of this sign in regional cardiac tamponade. METHODS AND RESULTS. We retrospectively analyzed the echocardiograms of 18 patients with postoperative cardiac tamponade for the following echocardiographic findings: right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, left atrial collapse, and left ventricular diastolic collapse. Three of the 18 patients had circumferential pericardial effusion, and 15 had loculated pericardial effusion; in 10, the effusion was predominantly posterior, and in the other five, it extended laterally or inferiorly. The conventional echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade such as right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, and left atrial collapse were present in only 3, 1, and 3 of these 15 patients, respectively, but all exhibited left ventricular diastolic collapse. Increasing pressure within the compartment of a loculated pericardial effusion reaching the limit of pericardial distensibility and consequent transient reversal of transmural left ventricular pressure during diastole are most likely the basis for diastolic collapse of the thick-walled ventricle in a setting of regional cardiac tamponade. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that left ventricular diastolic collapse is a frequent sign of regional cardiac tamponade and could be a useful marker of tamponade in postoperative patients. \nEffect of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunization on prolonged apnea or bradycardia in siblings of sudden infant death syndrome victims. To determine whether the incidence of apnea or bradycardia increased after the first diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) immunization in 100 subsequent siblings of victims of sudden infant death syndrome, we examined data obtained from floppy disk recordings attached to apnea-bradycardia monitors for episodes of apnea lasting 15 seconds or longer and episodes of bradycardia lasting 10 seconds or longer. The data were divided into three periods: (1) 10 days before the first DTP immunization was received (pre-DTP period), (2) 10 days immediately after the DTP (DTP period), and (3) 10 days after the DTP period (post-DTP period). Seventeen infants had at least one episode of prolonged apnea or prolonged bradycardia either before or after the 30-day study period (eight before only, eight after only, and one before and after). None of the infants had episodes of apnea lasting 15 seconds or more or bradycardia lasting 10 seconds or more during the pre-DTP or DTP period. One episode of apnea, 16 seconds long, and one episode of bradycardia lasting 11 seconds occurred in the post-DTP period. These results failed to confirm the clinical impression that DTP immunizations are associated with an increased frequency and severity of prolonged apnea. They also place in question the utility of assessing an infant's response to a DTP immunization to determine continued risk of apnea and bradycardia before home monitoring is discontinued. \nA phase II trial of high-dose cisplatin and dacarbazine. Lack of efficacy of high-dose, cisplatin-based therapy for metastatic melanoma. Cisplatin and dacarbazine are used widely in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. To evaluate high-dose cisplatin and dacarbazine, 32 patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 and dacarbazine 350 mg/m2 daily for three days repeated at 28-day intervals. Their median age was 43.5 years (range, 25 to 73 years), and their median Karnofsky performance status was 80% (range, 70% to 100%). Measurable and evaluable disease sites (number of patients) included lymph nodes (22), lung (17), soft tissue (16), liver (13), bone (seven), spleen (four), adrenal gland (three), skin (three), and other sites (five). Patients received a median of two cycles of therapy (range, one to eight cycles). Thirty patients were evaluable for response. No complete responses were observed. Five patients had a partial response (17%; 95% confidence interval, 3% to 30%) for 16+, 12+, 7, 6.5, and 3 months. Responding sites of disease included lymph nodes (five of 22), lung (three of 17), and soft tissue (two of 16). Hematologic toxicity (Grade greater than or equal to 3) included neutropenia (16 of 32 patients, 30 of 90 cycles), thrombocytopenia (eight of 32 patients, 12 of 90 cycles), and anemia (five patients). Nine episodes of neutropenia and fever were seen in four patients; two had bacteremia. Nonhematologic toxicity (Grade greater than or equal to 3) included hypotension (two patients), nausea and vomiting (four), neuropathy (two), ototoxicity (four), and hypomagnesemia (nine). The low objective response rate and severe toxicity of this regimen preclude its standard use in patients with metastatic melanoma. A review of cisplatin-based therapy in metastatic melanoma suggests that there is no dose-response relationship. The use of high-dose cisplatin (greater than 100 mg/m2) in the treatment of metastatic melanoma is not recommended. \nCirculatory abnormalities and compensatory mechanisms in heart failure. Knowledge of the basic alterations of central hemodynamics in congestive heart failure has failed to explain many aspects of this important syndrome. Increasing attention has recently been paid to compensatory and adaptive mechanisms occurring after the initial insult. Thus, new insights have been gained into the pathophysiology of contraction of hypertrophied myocardium and changes of adrenergic receptors in the myocardium due to chronically increased cardiac sympathetic tone. The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in early and advanced congestive heart failure has been further elucidated, and the role of the vasodilating atrial natriuretic peptide is undergoing further definition. New results further clarify the mechanisms leading to breathlessness and muscular fatigue in congestive heart failure, with emphasis shifting from the traditional concept of the importance of increased filling pressures to changes to the peripheral circulation and exercising muscles. Although progress has been made in understanding of the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, many aspects are still poorly understood and await clarification. \nThe eyes of child abuse victims: autopsy findings. The authors studied 77 pairs of eyes removed from children who had died of suspected child abuse. Forty-seven of the cases had retinal hemorrhages. Those showing retinal hemorrhages were younger children and had fewer other stigmata of child abuse. Hemorrhages are more likely to occur in cases where the child was shaken or swung than in those with severe direct head trauma. The authors recommend that examination of the eyes be included in the autopsies of all small children who died without an obvious cause of death. Experience in both processing and reading of ocular material is necessary for reliable results. \nCrossing failure in PTCA: mind the deflated balloon profile! An attempt to reposition an Integra PTCA balloon-on-a-wire failed although the whole stenosed segment could be crossed before inflation. After careful removal the device showed a grossly altered shape. Deflated balloon profiles, quite different from the initial shape, can determine the outcome both in dissections and in multilesion cases. \nSuprascapular nerve lesions at the spinoglenoid notch: report of three cases and review of the literature. Lesions of the suprascapular nerve can occur at the supraspinatus notch (SSN) or at the spinoglenoid notch (SGN). Electromyographic (EMG), evaluation of the infraspinatus, and especially the supraspinatus muscles distinguishes SGN from SSN lesions. Three cases of SGN lesions, which are more common than SSN lesions, are presented. \nIfosfamide continuous infusion without mesna. A phase I trial of a 14-day cycle. Twenty patients received 27 courses of ifosfamide administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 14 days without Mesna. The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with Mesna. Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg/m2/d. Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400, 450, and 500 mg/m2/d. There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria. At 550 mg/m2/d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion (1), nausea (1), and Grade 2 leukopenia (1). The recommended dose of 500 mg/m2/d delivers a total dose of 7 g/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion. Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial. The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria. The protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without Mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to $890 per cycle. Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained. \nVpreB gene expression in hematopoietic malignancies: a lineage- and stage-restricted marker for B-cell precursor leukemias. We show here that analysis of VpreB gene transcription can be a specific way to identify acute leukemias of cells at very early stages of B-cell development. Northern blot analysis of RNAs from 63 leukemia samples showed that VpreB RNA was present in malignancies of precursor B cells, the expression being a feature of both common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (CD10+) and null ALL (CD10-). It was absent from malignancies of mature B cells (surface Ig positive), from acute leukemias of the T-cell lineage and granulocyte-macrophage lineages, and from normal tonsil B and T lymphocytes. Chronic myeloid leukemia blast crises of the B-precursor-cell type expressed the VpreB gene while myeloid blast crises did not. VpreB RNA was also expressed in the neoplastic cells of one of three patients with acute undifferentiated leukemias. These data show that VpreB RNA expression is a marker of the malignant forms of precursor B cells, and that it appears at least as early as cytoplasmic CD22 and CD19 in tumors of the B-cell lineage. \nArgon laser photocoagulation for neovascular maculopathy. Five-year results from randomized clinical trials. Macular Photocoagulation Study Group. With completion of follow-up of all patients enrolled in three randomized clinical trials of argon laser photocoagulation of extrafoveal choroidal neovascular membranes secondary to senile (age-related) macular degeneration, ocular histoplasmosis, or idiopathic causes, the Macular Photocoagulation Study Group has demonstrated that laser treatment of such lesions is beneficial in preventing or delaying large losses of visual acuity for at least 5 years. In eyes with senile (age-related) macular degeneration as the underlying cause, the relative risk of losing six or more lines of visual acuity from the baseline level among untreated eyes (n = 117) compared with laser-treated eyes (n = 119) was 1.5 from 6 months through 5 years after entry (P = .001). In addition, after 5 years, untreated eyes had lost a mean of 7.1 lines of visual acuity, while laser-treated eyes had lost 5.2 lines. Recurrent neovascularization had been observed in 54% of laser-treated eyes by the end of the 5-year follow-up period. Among eyes with ocular histoplasmosis, untreated eyes (n = 130) had 3.6 times the risk of laser-treated eyes (n = 132) of losing six or more lines of visual acuity (P less than .0001). Also, untreated eyes had lost a mean of 4.4 lines of visual acuity after 5 years, compared with only 0.9 lines lost by laser-treated eyes. Among laser-treated eyes, recurrent neovascularization had been observed in 26% by 5 years after enrollment. \nClassical conditioning of ventilatory responses in humans. A classical conditioning experiment, in which an auditory stimulus was paired with a hypoxic stimulus, was carried out on 34 normal subjects assigned to two groups (experimental and control). Each subject took part in one session divided into two phases, acquisition and test. In the acquisition phase, eight hypoxic and eight auditory stimuli were paired in the experimental group and unpaired in the control group. In the test phase, which was identical for the two groups, the hypoxic stimuli were suppressed and three purely auditory stimuli were presented. Significant differences between the two groups in ventilatory response to these auditory stimuli provided evidence for conditioning. In the control group, no significant changes were elicited by the auditory stimuli, whereas a conditioned increase in total cycle duration was observed in the experimental group. The conditioned response closely resembled the first component of the hypoxic response. Analysis of the pattern of the conditioned response, along with postexperimental interviews, strongly suggests that this response was not mediated by volitional factors. \nPeritoneal adhesion formation after lysis: inhibition by polyethylene glycol 4000. Peritoneal adhesions cause much long-term postoperative morbidity. This study evaluates the efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 in reducing adhesion reformation after lysis. Adhesions were induced, by abrasion, in 111 Sprague-Dawley rats at a first laparotomy. At a second operation, 10 days later, these adhesions were graded and lysed, after which the animals received one of the following solutions intraperitoneally: 5 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 21), 25 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 23), 32 per cent dextran 70 (n = 22) or isotonic saline (n = 25), or were left as an untreated control group (n = 20). When the reformed adhesions were graded after a further 10 days 5 per cent PEG 4000 was found to be the only solution that inhibited adhesion reformation. The adhesions that reformed in the other four test groups were significantly worse than when they were first graded (P less than or equal to 0.033 for all groups). Therefore 5 per cent PEG 4000 may be useful in clinical practice for the reduction of adhesion formation after lysis. \nThe effect of preoperative therapy on the histologic features of Wilms' tumor. An analysis of cases from the Third National Wilms' Tumor Study. Preoperative chemotherapy is being used with increasing frequency in the US for the management of selected children with Wilms' tumor, despite relatively limited knowledge as to the effects of such therapy on tumor histologic features. The authors reviewed pathologic material from all preoperatively treated unilateral Wilms' tumors registered on the third National Wilms' Tumor Study. Preoperative therapy was associated with increased ambiguity of tumor stage. The prevalence of anaplasia in the 83 evaluable specimens was similar to, although slightly increased over, that in comparable high-stage untreated Wilms' tumors (11% versus 5% to 8%), and it appeared to retain its adverse connotations. These data also suggest that alterations of tumor character and distribution by therapy provide useful prognostic information. All 17 children whose residual viable tumor was limited to intrarenal sites at the time of resection were alive and disease-free at last follow-up. Extensive (greater than 90%) tumor necrosis, low mitotic activity, and high degrees of differentiation of residual tumor were also associated with favorable outcomes. Although careful utilization of preoperative chemotherapy can be of value in children with otherwise difficult-to-manage Wilms' tumors, the potential benefits of preoperative tumor bulk reduction must be weighed against the risk of overtreatment or undertreatment as a result of increased ambiguity of tumor stage. \nEfficacy of ampicillin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in a mouse model of lethal enterococcal peritonitis. Lethal enterococcal peritonitis in mice was used to compare trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) therapy with ampicillin therapy. Peritoneal fluid showed a 10(3)-CFU decrease in enterococci with ampicillin compared with TMP-SMX. Mortality of the untreated mice was 100%, compared with 40% for ampicillin and 95% for TMP-SMX, despite adequately measured levels in serum and peritoneal fluid. \nRespiratory complications and hypoxic episodes during inhalation induction with isoflurane in children. We have studied the incidence of respiratory complications and hypoxic episodes during inhalation induction with isoflurane in 75 healthy unpremedicated children. Problems occurred less frequently when 4% isoflurane in oxygen was used from the outset than with traditional techniques using nitrous oxide and a gradually increasing inspired vapour concentration. The improved results observed with the former method may be secondary to more rapid uptake of vapour so that the second stage of anaesthesia characteristic of anaesthetic ethers is shortened considerably. \nResection and reconstruction of the carotid bifurcation with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts; operative technique. Preliminary results in 25 procedures and indications. Although carotid endarterectomy is the standard procedure, the purpose of this paper is to describe a new surgical technique and indicate its role in the surgery of cervical cerebrovascular disease. The technique consists of resection of the pathologic carotid artery bifurcation followed by its total replacement with a bifurcated thin-wall polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft constructed by the surgeon. Prosthetic graft reconstruction of the carotid bifurcation (PGRCB) was performed in 21 patients (25 procedures) from November 1984 to May 1987. Many patients were over 70 years old. The indications for surgery were transient ischemic attacks (TIA)'s in 10 patients (high-grade stenosis), established stroke with mild deficit in 3 patients (high-grade stenosis). Eight patients (high-grade stenosis) were asymptomatic and 4 had vertebro-basilar symptoms. In 11 procedures the indications were the same as for standard carotid endarterectomy (significant stenosis and/or ulcerated plaque). In 14 cases, the procedure was justified by extensive lesions involving a long segment of the internal carotid artery (2 restenoses, 12 calcified lesions). In the perioperative period, there were no deaths and no TIA's. The 25 procedures were assessed one month postoperatively by ultrasonic imaging and venous substraction angiography. All the grafts were patent with perfect restoration of the carotid bifurcation anatomy. Systematic follow-up study was carried out in 1987. Three patients had died of non-neurologic causes and one was lost to study. The remaining 19 procedures were evaluated with an average follow-up of 19 months (range 7 to 32 months). The patients were asymptomatic and all the grafts remained patent including one stenosis (greater than 50%) at the common carotid artery anastomosis. Because recent studies have documented a much higher rate of technical defects or recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy, we believe that PGRCB merits consideration, particularly in difficult endarterectomies, and in recurrent carotid stenosis. Furthermore it seems acceptable to advocate PGRCB in aneurysms of the internal carotid artery and in post-irradiation arteritis. \nEffects of antiarrhythmic drugs on canine atrial flutter due to reentry: role of prolongation of refractory period and depression of conduction to excitable gap. Antiarrhythmic drugs prolong the effective refractory period and depress conduction. To determine the exact role played by these two electrophysiologic effects in the termination of reentry, the effects of disopyramide, flecainide, propafenone and E-4031, a new class III drug, were examined in a canine model of atrial flutter (cycle length 120 +/- 4 to 131 +/- 3 ms) caused by reentry. Atrial flutter was induced in 32 anesthetized open chest dogs after placement of an intercaval crush. The excitable gap ranged from 9 +/- 2% to 11 +/- 4% of the basic flutter cycle length. The effective refractory period in the reentrant circuit during atrial flutter was estimated by subtracting the excitable gap from the basic flutter cycle length. Prolongation of flutter cycle length by the test drugs was proportional to the interatrial conduction time (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001). Atrial flutter was terminated by each test drug in all dogs except for flecainide and propafenone in one dog each. E-4031 prolonged the refractory period during atrial flutter to 129 +/- 6 ms, which did not differ significantly from the flutter cycle length immediately before termination (134 +/- 4 ms). The refractory period during atrial flutter after injection of the other drugs was shorter than the flutter cycle length before termination of atrial flutter (for example, flecainide 126 +/- 5 vs. 179 +/- 11 ms, p less than 0.01). \nPhantom-related phenomena after rectal amputation: prevalence and clinical characteristics. Phantom sensations are well known and almost inevitable sequels to limb amputation, whereas similar phenomena are only rarely described after rectum amputation (phantom rectum). Our study attempted to assess the frequency and character of phantom rectum. All surviving patients (n = 22), who had undergone abdominoperineal surgical resection of the rectum in the period 1980-1986 at our clinic, were interviewed by a standard questionnaire and underwent a physical examination. Sixty-eight per cent of the patients experienced a sensation of a missing rectum (phantom rectum), and in 27% of these or 18% of all patients this sensation was painful (phantom pain). The most common symptoms were sensations of flatus and/or faeces in a normal rectum, phantom flatus or phantom faeces. The phantom pains were described as either pricking and shooting or like haemorrhoids or hard stools that would rupture the rectum. Neither age, sex, preoperative pain, the Duke classification of the tumour nor the healing of the perineal wound seemed related to the likelihood of phantom rectum. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying phantom-related phenomena following amputation have not yet been elucidated. This study describes a relatively unknown phantom-related clinical entity after amputation and may thus contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon. \nInduction of apoptosis during normal and neoplastic B-cell development in the bursa of Fabricius. The lymphoid cells of embryonic bursal follicles are engaged in rapid growth and preimmune diversification of immunoglobulin genes. Disruption of follicular architecture by mechanical dispersion of these cells in short-term tissue culture was accompanied by continued cell division and extensive cell death by apoptosis. Apoptosis was suppressed in parallel cultures of intact follicles. gamma Radiation also triggered extensive apoptosis in embryonic bursal follicles within a few hours. Preneoplastic bursal stem cell populations induced by a v-myc oncogene were hypersensitive to induction of apoptosis by follicular dispersion and radiation. In contrast, tumor progression in v-myc- and v-rel-initiated bursal neoplasms was accompanied by development of resistance to induction of apoptosis. A programmed cell death pathway can be activated during normal B-cell development in the bursa, and alterations in the expression of this pathway accompany neoplastic change in this system. \nOperations for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Forty-six patients with symptomatic tachycardia underwent operations to divide 55 atrioventricular accessory pathways. Mean age was 29 years (range 11 to 63). Ten patients (22%) had associated cardiac disease, including two with a congenital diverticulum of the coronary sinus and six (13%) who had concomitant surgical procedures. A bipolar hand-held electrode was used in 22 operations, and simultaneous multisite mapping in the last 24 operations. Ten patients (22%) had multiple accessory pathways. A modified endocardial approach was used. The overall patient success rate was 93% with 91% to 93% of accessory pathways successfully divided. The perioperative morbidity was 17%. There were two reoperations. There were no early or late deaths. Patients have been followed up for a mean of 16 months. There were five recurrences of preexcitation (two early, three late). Two of these patients (both with a congenital diverticulum of the coronary sinus) had reoperation. One patient had late recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Operation for the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome has a high probability of success with a low operative risk. \nChronic perineal pain related to sacral meningeal cysts. Chronic perineal pain is an often encountered problem that is difficult to evaluate. Based on a series of 17 patients in whom urological, gynecological, and anorectal pathology was excluded, the authors compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with computed tomographic (CT) scan with myelography in the investigation of chronic perineal pain. After a clinical neurological examination, patients underwent radiodiagnostic imaging of both techniques. Thirteen patients (76%) had one or more sacral meningeal cysts (MC) on MRI scan, whereas CT scan with myelography of the lumbar and sacral region revealed 7 patients (41%) with sacral MC. Sacral MC may be the etiology of chronic perineal pain in many instances, and MRI scan appears to be superior to CT scan with myelography in demonstrating sacral MC. Ten patients with sacral MC were operated on with moderate to excellent results 6 months after operation. Early postoperative results are encouraging, but further follow-up and larger series are required. \nEpidural sufentanil for postoperative analgesia: dose-response in patients recovering from major gynecologic surgery. To determine the lowest effective dose of epidural sufentanil given for analgesia, 41 patients undergoing elective abdominal gynecologic surgery during continuous epidural anesthesia (lidocaine 2%) were randomly assigned to one of four postoperative treatment groups. Patients received an epidural bolus of either 25 (group A), 40 (group B), 55 (group C), or 70 micrograms (group D) sufentanil in 10 mL of saline. They were evaluated for the next 8 h using a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Except for two individuals in group A, all patients achieved a visual analogue scale score of 1 cm or less during the study interval. The onset of analgesia was most rapid in the two higher dose groups (A vs C and D; P less than 0.05). Pairwise comparison between groups showed a significant difference in the time needed to achieve maximum pain relief between the lowest and highest treatment groups (A vs D; P less than 0.05). Duration of analgesia was also significantly longer in groups C and D than in group A (208.0 +/- 21.1 and 224.0 +/- 14.7 vs 140.0 +/- 10.7 min; P less than 0.05). There were no differences among groups with regard to mean respiratory rate, level of sedation, 24-h narcotic requirements, or incidence of nausea, vomiting, and pruritus (P = NS). A single patient in group D suffered profound respiratory depression within seconds of administration. We conclude that, in patients recovering from lower abdominal surgery, a single 40-55-micrograms epidural bolus of sufentanil provides 3-3.5 h of effective analgesia, and that larger doses are not warranted. \nVenous thromboembolism after brain tumor surgery: a retrospective review. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence rate of clinical postoperative deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in 1703 patients undergoing initial craniotomy for meningioma, glioma, or cerebral metastasis. The incidence rate of clinical thromboembolic complications was 1.59% for all tumor groups within the first 4 weeks of surgery. Patients undergoing surgery for meningiomas had a statistically significant increased risk of thromboembolism despite fewer overall perioperative risk factors, when compared with the other tumor groups. The tumor-specific incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism for meningioma, glioma, and metastasis were 3.09%, 0.97%, and 1.03%, respectively. Whether this difference was a result of increased surgical time or an inherent property of meningiomas could not be ascertained. \nTethered cord syndrome complicating spina bifida occulta. A case report. The insidious onset of back and/or leg pain, weakness and spasticity of the lower limb, sensory deficits and neurogenic bladder and bowel in a child with spina bifida might represent a tethered cord syndrome. A case report of a child with sudden neurologic deterioration describes this condition. The successful management in children and adults with tethered cord syndrome is improved with early recognition and careful monitoring. \nDiagnosis and cure of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias during a single electrophysiologic test BACKGROUND. We conducted this study to determine the feasibility of an abbreviated therapeutic approach to the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, in which the diagnosis is established and radiofrequency ablation carried out during a single electrophysiologic test. METHODS. One hundred six consecutive patients were referred for the management of documented, symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (66 patients) or the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (40 patients). All agreed to undergo a diagnostic electrophysiologic test and catheter ablation with radiofrequency current. No patient had had such a test previously. RESULTS. Among the 66 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, the mechanism was found to be atrioventricular nodal reentry in 46 (70 percent) (typical in 44 and atypical in 2), atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia involving a concealed accessory pathway in 16 (24 percent), atrial tachycardia in 2 (3 percent), and noninducible paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in 2 (3 percent). A successful long-term outcome was achieved in 57 of 62 patients (92 percent) with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in whom ablation was attempted and in 37 of 40 patients (93 percent) with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The only complications were one instance of occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, leading to acute myocardial infarction, and one instance of complete atrioventricular block. The mean (+/- SD) duration of the electrophysiologic procedures was 114 +/- 55 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. The diagnosis and cure of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during a single electrophysiologic test are feasible and practical and have a favorable risk-benefit ratio. This abbreviated therapeutic approach may eliminate the need for serial electropharmacologic testing, long-term drug therapy, antitachycardia pacemakers, and surgical ablation. \nInitial 5-fluorouracil trabeculectomy in uncomplicated glaucoma. The effectiveness of trabeculectomy with adjunctive low-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as the initial surgical procedure in uncomplicated glaucoma was evaluated retrospectively in a consecutive series of 52 patients (mean follow-up, 18.6 +/- 11.7 mos) and 74 control subjects. The cumulative 2-year success (intraocular pressure [IOP] less than 21 mmHg) was 100% in the 5-FU group and 78.9% in the control group (P = 0.01, Wilcoxon test). The 5-FU group had a mean postoperative IOP of 12.5 +/- 4.6 mmHg versus 17.4 +/- 5.7 mmHg in the control group at 2-year follow-up (P = 0.015, t test). Antiglaucoma medications were required in 5.8% of patients in the 5-FU group and in 41.9% of controls within 2 years (P less than 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). These results suggest that low-dose 5-FU at the time of initial trabeculectomy leads to a higher success rate, lower IOP, and less need for antiglaucoma medications postoperatively. \nImportance of the immune response to the Ro/La particle in the development of congenital heart block and neonatal lupus erythematosus. Previous studies have suggested a role for anti-Ro antibodies in the pathogenesis of neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). We reexamined the role of the immune response to the Ro/La particle in the development of NLE using newer and more definitive assay techniques. All 15 infants with congenital heart block and NLE had both anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. Of 8 patients with cutaneous NLE alone, 2 had anti-Ro antibodies alone while the remaining 6 had both anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. One woman gave birth to 2 children; one had both Ro and La antibodies and developed congenital heart block, the other had only anti-Ro and anti-U1RNP antibodies and was clinically normal. Our study demonstrates that the presence of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies define the immune response that is associated with the development of congenital heart block of NLE. \nEffects of nonionic versus ionic contrast media on complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. To evaluate the effect of contrast agents on percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) complications, 913 patients undergoing 1,058 separate PTCA procedures were prospectively randomized to receive either nonionic iopamidol (Isovue-370) [n = 507 PTCA procedures] or ionic contrast media, meglumine sodium diatrizoate (Renografin-76) [n = 551 PTCA procedures]. Angioplasty operators, technicians, nurses and patients were blinded to the agent used. All patients were pretreated with 0.6 mg of atropine sulfate intravenously before any contrast injections. Hypotension (mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg associated with contrast injections) occurred during 8.5% of PTCA procedures in which the patients were receiving iopamidol and during 9.5% of the procedures in which the patients were given diatrizoate (difference not significant). Bradycardia (heart rate of less than 40 beats/min associated with contrast injections) developed during 5.7% of procedures when patients were given iopamidol and during 5.1% of procedures when patients were given diatrizoate (difference not significant). The need for additional atropine or temporary pacing during the procedure was similar for patients given iopamidol and diatrizoate. The overall incidence of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or both, during the procedure occurred less frequently when iopamidol was used compared with diatrizoate (1 vs 2.5%, p = 0.045). These serious ventricular arrhythmias were attributable to contrast injections in 0.6% of the PTCA procedures when iopamidol was given and in 2.0% of the cases in which diatrizoate was the contrast agent (p = 0.09). Only 1 patient had an allergic reaction to the contrast agent, and this was in a patient who received iopamidol. \nEfficacy and safety of intravenous and oral propafenone in pediatric cardiac dysrhythmias. Propafenone was administered to 58 patients with a mean age of 3.2 years (range 0.1 to 16). Mean intravenous dose was 1.2 mg/kg body weight (range 0.3 to 1.5 mg). The final mean oral maintenance dose was 308 mg/m2 body surface area (range 200 to 600 mg/m2, 16.8 mg/kg body weight). After intravenous application, propafenone was effective in 21 of 36 patients; atrial flutter was converted in 1 of 5 patients, and reentry supraventricular tachycardia was controlled in 15 of 25 patients. Propafenone was partially or completely effective in 3 of 4 patients with chaotic atrial tachycardia. Junctional ectopic tachycardia was suppressed in 2 infants. Thirty-seven patients had oral treatment with a mean follow-up of 2.2 years. Propafenone was effective in 33 of 37 patients (89%); atrial flutter was controlled in 2 patients, ventricular ectopy was suppressed in 1 of 2 patients. In reentry supraventricular tachycardia, propafenone was effective in 25 of 28 patients. Chaotic atrial tachycardia (n = 3) and junctional ectopic tachycardia (n = 2) were controlled after successful intravenous therapy. Systemic side effects were rare. Two patients developed a proarrhythmic effect, and 1 patient with ventricular ectopy after repair of tetralogy of Fallot died suddenly during propafenone maintenance therapy. \nSerum ferritin: a tumor marker for renal cell carcinoma. Serum ferritin levels in 32 patients with renal cell carcinoma were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Serum ferritin concentration was significantly higher in renal cell carcinoma patients compared to controls (259.10 versus 61.30 ng./ml., p less than 0.001). Furthermore, there was a steady and statistically significant increase in serum ferritin levels with advancing disease stage, as well as a significant decrease in serum ferritin levels after nephrectomy for stages 1 and 2 disease. The intracellular content of ferritin as estimated by polyclonal antibody was dramatically increased in renal cancer tissue compared to normal parenchyma. Although serum ferritin regulation is complex and only partly understood, the present study suggests that serum ferritin may be a useful tumor marker for renal cell carcinoma. \nPost-traumatic syringomyelia following uncomplicated spinal fracture. Two cases of post-traumatic syringomyelia presenting 10 and 41 years after spinal injuries that had caused lumbar vertebral fractures but no lasting neurological deficits are reported. In both patients the caudal end of the syrinx cavities, as shown by MRI, corresponded to the level of the previous vertebral fractures. Patients presenting with post-traumatic syringomyelia after uncomplicated spinal fracture are very rare, and the significance of the past history of spinal trauma may be overlooked. \nClonorchis-associated cholangiocarcinoma: a report of two cases with unusual manifestations. Two cases of Clonorchis-associated cholangiocarcinoma are described along with their cholangiographic features to illustrate the spectrum of pathology ascribed to the injurious effects of the flukes on the bile duct epithelium. This includes adenomatous hyperplasia, extensive fibrosis, and carcinoma. The first case was also complicated by hepatic abscesses, left hepatic lobar atrophy, gastrobiliary and biliarocutaneous fistulae. The second case features an unusually dilated pancreatic duct containing pancreaticoliths that was found later to consist of hyperplastic bile duct epithelium, presumably carried by worm migration in the biliary tree. Liver sections from both patients showed typical features of hepatic clonorchiasis with the cancer. A knowledge of the wide spectrum of clinical presentation of clonorchiasis, particularly cholangiocarcinoma, might aid Western physicians in averting this serious sequela through prompt eradication of the helminthic infection and early recognition and treatment of its complications. \nComparison of human pain sensation and flexion withdrawal evoked by noxious radiant heat. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of flexion withdrawal magnitude as an indicator of pain sensation. In 10 healthy human volunteers, we compared the magnitude and latency of integrated biceps EMG with the subjects' rating of pain, using a visual analog scale, elicited by noxious radiant heat stimuli applied to the dorsal forearm. The magnitude and inverse latency of withdrawal, although variable, increased exponentially as a functions of stimulus temperature. The stimulus response functions for mean withdrawal magnitude and mean pain intensity were similar for lower stimulus temperatures, but at higher temperatures the withdrawal continued to increase exponentially whereas pain intensity reached a plateau. The pain intensity and withdrawal magnitude for each stimulus were poorly correlated. Under the conditions of this experiment, mean pain intensity and mean withdrawal magnitude were both well correlated with stimulus temperature, but the magnitude of withdrawal did not reliably reflect the intensity of pain sensation. \nNeuronal activity up-regulates astroglial gene expression. Neuronal gene expression is known to be modulated by functional activity. This modulation is thought to play a key role in determining the differentiation of developing neurons and regulating the operation of mature neurons. Here we describe a regulation of astroglial gene expression by neuronal activity. We report that intense neuronal activity (electrically induced seizures) in rat hippocampus leads to rapid and dramatic increases in mRNA for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astroglia-specific intermediate filament protein. GFAP mRNA levels increased at sites of stimulation as well as in areas that were synaptically activated by the resultant seizures. When seizures were induced repetitively for many days, levels of GFAP mRNA remained chronically elevated. However, GFAP mRNA returned to control levels within a few days after the cessation of stimulation. The coupling between astroglial gene expression and neuronal activity may be a mechanism through which neuronal activity modulates the function of supporting cells that are responsible for regulating the extracellular microenvironment of the brain. \nHazards of mattresses, beds and bedding in deaths of infants. Of 52 infants who had died suddenly and were referred to autopsy, nine had lain on adult water beds for the first time; five had died as a result of accidents; two had died on water beds; two were in beds with widely spaced slats; and one had died as a result of strangulation. Three deaths were due to overlying. Three other infants had been placed on sheepskin rugs for the first time and were found dead shortly thereafter. These infants ranged in age from 2 to 9 months, except for a severely mentally retarded nine-year-old with spastic paraplegia. We believe that a general warning should be issued concerning water beds and that soft bedding should not be used for infants. Infants should not be placed unattended or left to sleep on water beds; only beds recommended for infants should be used. Overlying of a young infant is most likely to occur on a water bed, or if the parent is obese or has consumed alcohol. \nIntraperitoneal thrombolytic agents in relapsing or persistent peritonitis of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Urokinase or streptokinase was instilled intraperitoneally as an adjunct to the antibiotic therapy in 16 episodes of relapsing or persistent peritonitis in CAPD patients. In eight patients the combination of antibiotics and intraperitoneal thrombolytic agents resulted in clearing of the infection with no recurrences. The treatment failed in eight other patients, who had their peritoneal catheters removed. Six of the last eight patients had either abdominal wall abscesses or persistence of the bacteria on the wall of the peritoneal catheter. Elevated post-intraperitoneal instillation peritoneal fluid neutrophil counts and positive post-instillation peritoneal fluid cultures predicted failure of the intraperitoneal instillation of thrombolytic agents in most instances. Intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase may help cure approximately 50% of the episodes of relapsing for persistent peritonitis. Post-instillation peritoneal fluid cell counts and cultures should be monitored. Radiologic investigation for abdominal wall or intraabdominal abscesses is indicated if intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase fails to eradicate peritonitis. \nHyperbaric treatment of cerebral air embolism sustained during an open-heart surgical procedure A case of cerebral air embolism sustained during replacement of the mitral valve resulted in postoperative coma and seizures. Hyperbaric treatment, begun 30 hours after the occurrence of the air embolism, resulted in good immediate and long-term recovery. Mild deficits of the left hemisphere were present at follow-up 53 days after the embolus was sustained, and lesser, minimal residua were present at 14-month follow-up. Hyperbaric treatment is the definitive therapy for cerebral air embolism. Although it is most effective when administered early, the outcome may be excellent even with late treatment. \nHepatocellular carcinoma in Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii): evidence for association with hepatitis B-like virus infection. During studies of seasonal obesity, a high frequency of hepatic neoplasms was observed in Richardson's ground squirrels. Of 12 Richardson's ground squirrels examined thoroughly, 7 had mild or moderate degrees of chronic portal hepatitis and 6 (50%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Serological tests for hepadnavirus surface antigen, anti-core antibody and virion DNA that recognize the ground squirrel hepatitis virus of California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) were uniformly negative. Southern blot analyses of EcoRI digests of liver cell DNA demonstrated 3.2 kb fragments that hybridized with a ground squirrel hepatitis virus-specific probe in nontumorous liver tissue from 6 of 10 ground squirrels and in hepatocellular carcinoma specimens from 2 of 5 squirrels indicating infection with a hepadnavirus related to ground squirrel hepatitis virus. Failure, however, to detect serum antibody to ground squirrel hepatitis core antigen suggested probable antigenic differences between the ground squirrel hepatitis virus of California ground squirrels and the putative Richardson's ground squirrel agent. Further studies are required to fully characterize the hepadnavirus of Richardson's ground squirrels and to determine its relationship to hepatocarcinogenesis in this species. \nAdenovirus E1a prevents the retinoblastoma gene product from complexing with a cellular transcription factor. The transforming proteins of several DNA tumour viruses, including adenovirus E1a and simian virus 40 large T antigen, complex with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour-suppressor gene product. This requires regions in these viral proteins necessary for transformation and is thought to inactivate the growth-suppressing properties of the Rb protein by disrupting its interaction with cellular targets. Indeed, regions of Rb required to form a complex with E1a and large T antigen are often mutated in transformed cells. The level at which the Rb protein regulates proliferation is unknown, although one possibility is transcription. We have previously characterized a sequence-specific transcription factor, DRTF1, the activity of which is downregulated as embryonal carcinoma stem cells differentiate. DRTF1 is found in several discrete protein complexes (a, b and c) which are of different sizes but have the same DNA specificity. We now show that one of these also contains the Rb protein and, further, that the adenovirus E1a protein causes the dissociation of the Rb protein from this complex. This requires conserved regions 1 and 2 of E1a that are known to be required for efficient transformation. These results demonstrate that the Rb protein forms a complex with a DNA-bound transcription factor, and suggests that the Rb protein might act by regulating transcription. \nEnhanced immunoglobulin levels correlate with infectious complications after surgery in esophageal cancer. Severe septic complications account for the high mortality of patients with esophageal cancer. We examined the levels of immunoglobulins and complements together with infection-related complications in a large number of patients. Enhancements of IgG, IgA, C3, C4, and CH50 were evident in patients with esophageal cancer and were more predominant compared to findings in cases of gastric cancer. Average levels of IgG and IgA immediately before surgery were significantly higher in esophageal cancer patients with postoperative septic complications than in those without such problems. Preoperative radiation therapy and total parenteral nutrition did not significantly alter the levels of immunoglobulins and complements. It would thus appear that the enhancement of IgG and IgA is associated with the occurrence of infectious complications following surgery for patients with esophageal cancer. \nEvaluating painful osteopenia in the elderly. Osteopenia is a frequent finding on radiographs of elderly patients. When the exam is performed for skeletal pain, this finding may be significant. The differential diagnosis for osteopenia is extensive, but individualizing the patient work-up begins with a careful clinical history and laboratory studies. Appropriate radiographic exams can then be requested. A plain radiograph is always the starting point, followed by--as indicated--a nuclear bone scan, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. \nCerebrovascular malformation causing sudden death. Analysis of three cases and review of the literature. Three unusual cases of sudden death resulting from cerebrovascular malformation (CVM) are presented. CVMs are highly variable in location and morphology, and may be difficult to detect. Two of the patients discussed here had CVMs that involved the circle of Willis directly, and produced rapidly fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain; both of these subjects were in their late 30s. One had a history of epilepsy; the other had been completely asymptomatic prior to the catastrophic event. The third was an asymptomatic 6 year old with a cerebellar CVM, who survived long enough for inconclusive neurosurgical intervention. In all three cases, the diagnosis was not made prior to autopsy; in one case, the circumstances of death were initially misleading. The relevant literature is reviewed and discussed, with emphasis on differential diagnosis, anatomic examination, and background investigation. \nExercise testing in patients with microvascular angina. The widespread use of exercise testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients suspected of having coronary artery disease led to the detection of ischemic changes in many subjects who subsequently were found to have angiographically normal epicardial vessels--the false positive response. Such a result is usually interpreted as indicating that the subject's chest pain is of noncardiac origin. For the past several years, we have studied the mechanism of pain resembling angina that occurs in patients with normal epicardial coronary arteries demonstrated by angiography; we believe these studies have shed some light on this problem. Patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries who present because of a history of angina-like pain and/or ischemic changes detected during exercise electrocardiogram testing were evaluated by measuring great cardiac vein flow (under baseline conditions and after cardiac pacing, with and without intravenous administration of ergonovine) and by radionuclide angiography before and during exercise. We found that a substantial number of these subjects showed inadequate coronary vasodilator reserve and had exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction suggestive of myocardial ischemia. We concluded from our results that there is a distinct clinical syndrome of myocardial ischemia caused by abnormal resistance responses of the prearteriolar coronary microvasculature. We now refer to this syndrome as microvascular angina. In a series of 115 patients with documented microvascular angina, we also found that only 10% had ischemic ST changes with exercise testing (2% of the men and 17% of the women developed ischemic ST segment changes). \nBreast cancer with bone-only metastases. Visceral metastases-free rate in relation to anatomic distribution of bone metastases. The medical records of 82 patients with breast cancer with bone-only metastases were reviewed. According to the distribution of the metastases by bone scan at the time they were first documented, the patients were divided into three groups: Group A (patients who had bone metastases exclusively cranial to the lumbosacral junction), Group B (patients who had bone metastases exclusively caudal to the junction), and Group C (patients who had bone metastases both cranial and caudal to the junction). Group A had a significantly higher visceral metastases-free rate than Groups B or C. Serial bone scans and radiographs of Group A patients revealed that bone lesions cranial to the junction rarely developed into visceral metastases and that bone lesions extending caudal to the junction frequently developed into visceral metastases. These results indicate that the presence of bone metastases caudal to the lumbosacral junction is predictive of visceral metastases. \nEffects of volatile anesthetics on response to norepinephrine and acetylcholine in guinea pig atria. The in vitro chronotropic and inotropic effects of norepinephrine and acetylcholine in isolated right and left guinea pig atria were examined in the absence and presence of halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane (0.6 and 1.2 MAC). All three anesthetics elicited dose-dependent reductions in contractile force and spontaneous pacemaker activity. The maximal developed tension observed in the presence of norepinephrine was not altered by the anesthetics and corresponding ED50 values increased only in the presence of 1.2 MAC halothane and 1.2 MAC isoflurane. The anesthetics did not affect (a) the maximal positive chronotropic effect of norepinephrine, (b) the ED50 values for its positive chronotropic effect, and (c) acetylcholine-induced negative inotropic and chronotropic actions and did not induce arrhythmic activity even in the presence of the maximally effective neurotransmitter concentrations. These findings indicate that in isolated guinea pig atria volatile anesthetics, in concentrations up to 1.2 MAC, do not alter the inotropic and chronotropic effects of norepinephrine or acetylcholine and do not induce arrhythmogenic action in the presence of the neurotransmitters. These data suggest that altered atrial responsiveness to adrenergic or muscarinic stimulation does not contribute to the development of anesthetic-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \nStress-induced gastroduodenal lesions and total parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients: frequency, complications, and the value of prophylactic treatment. A prospective, randomized study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency, complications, and value of prophylactic treatment of stress-induced gastroduodenal lesions. DESIGNS: Patients were prospectively randomized to treatment with total parenteral nutrition, either alone, with sucralfate, or with ranitidine. SETTING: A multidisciplinary ICU from a tertiary care referral center. PATIENTS: Ninety-seven patients submitted to prolonged mechanical ventilation, with normal hepatic and renal function, in metabolic stress, and receiving total parenteral nutrition. INTERVENTIONS: On admission, we determined the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and the catabolic index score. We also performed an endoscopic examination on day 3, every 7 days subsequently, and whenever needed. Thirty patients received total parenteral nutrition alone. Twenty-four patients received total parenteral nutrition and sucralfate (1 g by nasogastric tube every 4 hrs). Nineteen patients received total parenteral nutrition and ranitidine (50 mg iv every 6 hrs). MAIN RESULTS: The overall occurrence rate of gastroduodenal mucosal damage was 29.6%. The overall frequency rate for stress ulcerations was 15.6% and was 6.2% for stress hemorrhage. There were no deaths secondary to stress hemorrhage. The difference in the frequency of stress-induced mucosal lesions and stress hemorrhage between the studied groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Additional prophylaxis to total parenteral nutrition in the form of sucralfate and ranitidine to prevent acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not required in this group of ICU patients. \nPolyethylene wear from retrieved acetabular cups. Laboratory wear testing of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene from 12 Charnley acetabular cups, removed after periods of up to 17.5 years showed that the large patient-to-patient variations in clinical penetration rate cannot be explained by batch-to-batch variation in the wear resistance of the material. Nor was there any evidence of a time-dependent degradation in wear resistance of the material. \nThe effects on plasma lipoproteins of a prudent weight-reducing diet, with or without exercise, in overweight men and women. BACKGROUND. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommends a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet, with weight loss if indicated, to correct elevated plasma cholesterol levels. Weight loss accomplished by simple caloric restriction or increased exercise typically increases the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Little is known about the effects on plasma lipoproteins of a hypocaloric NCEP diet with or without exercise in overweight people. METHODS. We tested the hypothesis that exercise (walking or jogging) will increase HDL cholesterol levels in moderately overweight, sedentary people who adopt a hypocaloric NCEP diet. We randomly assigned 132 men and 132 women 25 to 49 years old to one of three groups: control, hypocaloric NCEP diet, or hypocaloric NCEP diet with exercise. One hundred nineteen of the men and 112 of the women returned for testing after one year. RESULTS. After one year, the subjects in both intervention groups had reached or closely approached NCEP Step 1 dietary goals and reduced their mean body fat significantly (range of reduction in mean fat weight, 4.0 to 7.8 kg). Weight loss on the NCEP diet alone did not significantly change HDL cholesterol levels in either the men or the women as compared with the subjects in the control group. Plasma levels of HDL cholesterol increased significantly more in the men who exercised and dieted (mean [+/- SE] change, +13 +/- 3 percent) than in the men who only dieted (+2 +/- 3 percent, P less than 0.01) or the men who acted as controls (-4 +/- 2 percent, P less than 0.001). HDL cholesterol levels remained about the same in the women who exercised and dieted (+1 +/- 2 percent); they were higher than in the women who only dieted (-10 +/- 3 percent, P less than 0.01), but not higher than in the controls (-3 +/- 3 percent). CONCLUSIONS. Regular exercise in overweight men and women enhances the improvement in plasma lipoprotein levels that results from the adoption of a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet. \nSubperiosteal abscess in children: scintigraphic appearance. A subperiosteal abscess is an uncommon complication of osteomyelitis in childhood. Bone scanning is very sensitive for the detection of early skeletal infection; however, a subperiosteal abscess has a different and distinctive scintigraphic appearance. The usual increased tracer uptake of osteomyelitis is overshadowed by the presence of a \"cold\" lesion on the delayed views, probably due to interruption of the vascular supply of the bone. Early recognition of the condition is important, as surgery is indicated to prevent extensive bone necrosis and chronic osteomyelitis. In suspected osteomyelitis, a central photopenic area is highly suggestive of subperiosteal abscess; when such an area is seen, a computed tomographic (CT) scan can be helpful in planning the surgical approach for drainage. Plain radiographs may be unremarkable even when the bone scan and CT findings are dramatic. Five such cases are presented, and a recommended diagnostic approach is discussed that views the two procedures as complementary. \nThe management of IIB osteosarcoma. Experience from 1976 to 1985. From 1976 to 1985, 75 IIB osteosarcomas have been treated out of a total of 98 osteosarcomas at the authors' institution. Because of the effective chemotherapy including high-dose methotrexate administered during this time period, the surgical management changed, and only ten patients out of the 75 IIB osteosarcomas required an amputation. The overall result of 76.7% of disease-free, three-year survival was equally distributed regardless of the surgical procedure. Endoprosthesis, resection with or without grafts, and rotationplasties, as well as amputations, revealed similar results. No negative influence from the limb-sparing surgery could be observed. \nSalivary secretion rate, yeast cells, and oral candidiasis in patients with acute leukemia. Stimulated salivary secretion rate was repeatedly determined in 29 patients with acute leukemia during two periods of cytotoxic treatment in myelosuppressive doses. For comparison, the salivary secretion rate was studied in 83 healthy persons and in three other groups of hospitalized patients without malignant disorders. At the start of cytotoxic treatment the secretion rate in the patients with leukemia was lower than in healthy persons. The rate fell significantly after 1 to 3 days and later rose to the level seen in the healthy persons. Several interacting factors may have contributed to the decrease in salivary secretion rate, but the most important factor was probably the use of antiemetic drugs during the first 3 days of the study periods. No relationship was found between salivary secretion rate and the number of gram-negative rods found in the mouth. Patients with low salivary secretion rates had high numbers of yeast cells and more often oral candidiasis. \nCSF monoamine metabolites, cholinesterases and lactate in the adult hydrocephalus syndrome (normal pressure hydrocephalus) related to CSF hydrodynamic parameters. Monoamine metabolites, cholinesterases and lactic acid in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were investigated on patients with the adult hydrocephalus syndrome (idiopathic normal pressure syndrome; AHS, n = 15), Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 14), multi-infarct dementia (MID, n = 13) and controls (n = 21). Patients had clinical and CSF hydrodynamic investigations. Monoamine concentrations were determined by reversed-phase liquid chromatography, cholinesterases and lactate were determined photometrically. In the AHS patients, CSF monoamine concentrations were not significantly different compared with controls, AD or MID patients. AHS and AD patients showed a similar reduction of CSF acetylcholinesterase activity compared with controls. Positive correlations were found in concentrations of CSF homovanillic acid, CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and CSF lactic acid versus CSF outflow conductance (that is, resistance against CSF outflow) in the AHS patients. A similar pattern was observed in a subgroup of MID patients characterised by dilated ventricles and disturbed CSF hydrodynamics. These data suggest that a low CSF outflow conductance may facilitate the clearance of acidic substances from the arachnoid space at the probenecid sensitive active transport site. Alternative explanations would be that a pathologically low CSF outflow conductance is accompanied by an inverse caudorostral flow of CSF or a compromised trans-ependymal diffusion. \nA prospective comparison of laser therapy and intubation in endoscopic palliation for malignant dysphagia. There is little objective long-term follow-up comparing laser therapy with intubation for palliation of malignant dysphagia. In a prospective, nonrandomized two-center trial 43 patients treated with the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser were compared with 30 patients treated by endoscopic intubation; the two groups were comparable for mean age and tumor position, length, and histology. Dysphagia was graded from 0 to 4 (0, normal swallowing; 4, dysphagia for liquids). Pretreatment mean dysphagia grades were similar: laser-treated group, 2.9 (SD, 0.6); intubated group, 3.2 (SD, 0.55). For thoracic esophageal tumors, the percentage of patients achieving an improvement in dysphagia grade by greater than or equal to 1 grade initially and over the long term was similar (laser, 95% and 77%; intubation, 100% and 86%). For tumors crossing the cardia, intubation was significantly better (laser, 59% and 50%; intubation, 100% and 92%, respectively; P less than 0.001). In patients palliated over a long period, however, the mean dysphagia grade over the remainder of their mean dysphagia grade over the remainder of their lives (mean survival: laser, 6.1 months; intubation, 5.1 months) was better in the laser group (1.6 vs. 2.0; P less than 0.01); 33% of laser-treated and 11% of intubated patients could eat most or all solids (P less than 0.05). For long-term palliation, laser-treated patients required on average more procedures (4.6 vs. 1.4; P less than 0.05) and days in the hospital (14 vs. 9; P less than 0.05). The perforation rate was lower in the laser-treated group (2% vs. 13%; P less than 0.02); no treatment-related deaths occurred in either group. For individual patients, the best results are likely to be achieved when the two techniques are used in a complementary fashion in specialist centers. \nAcinetobacter peritonitis in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Little is written on peritonitis caused by Acinetobacter species in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A retrospective review of medical records, dialysis unit charts, and microbiology culture logbooks identified 18 such patients treated at our hospital. All cases were community-acquired, and no common epidemiologic link between cases was detected. The most common manifestations were abdominal pain or tenderness (13 patients) and cloudy dialysate (six patients); only two patients had fever. Peritonitis without localized intra-abdominal abscess formation occurred in all instances. Intraperitoneal aminoglycoside therapy for 3 to 14 days (mean 10.7 days) eradicated infection in 14 cases. Two patients were successfully treated with 4 days of intraperitoneal gentamicin followed by 8 days of oral ciprofloxacin; another was cured with 10 days of IV ceftriaxone. Tenckhoff catheter removal was necessary in only one patient. Unlike pseudomonal or fungal peritonitis associated with CAPD, infection due to Acinetobacter species is generally responsive to antimicrobials alone. \nThe IPR inventory: development and psychometric characteristics. The purpose of this study was to develop, validate, and norm a measure of dimensions of interpersonal relationships that are salient to nursing: social support, reciprocity, and conflict. The selection of these concepts was guided by social exchange and equity theories. In the first phase of the study, 44 respondents were interviewed to provide narrative data from which to develop items so that items would be grounded in lived experience. Content validity of items was judged by a panel of 11 experts. The revised 39-item instrument was tested in successive steps with a total of 340 students, patients, and community residents for reliability and validity, including internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, factor analysis, and three forms of validity assessment (theory testing, contrasted groups, and multitrait-multimethod comparison). The three subscales of social support, reciprocity, and conflict demonstrated repeated internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Strong evidence of construct validity was demonstrated for the social support and the conflict subscales; validity of the reciprocity subscale was equivocal. \nVentilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia in awake rats pretreated with capsaicin. Ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia were measured by indirect plethysmography in unanesthetized unrestrained adult rats injected neonatally with capsaicin (50 mg/kg) or vehicle. Such capsaicin treatment ablates a subpopulation of primary afferent fibers containing substance P and various other neuropeptides. Ventilation was measured while the rats breathed air, 12% O2 in N2, 8% O2 in N2, 5% CO2 in O2, or 8% CO2 in O2. Neonatal treatment with capsaicin caused marked alterations in both the magnitude and composition of the hypoxic but not hypercapnic ventilatory response. The increase in minute ventilation evoked by hypoxia in the vehicle-treated rats resulted entirely from an increase in respiratory frequency. In the capsaicin-treated rats the hypoxic ventilatory response was significantly reduced owing to an attenuation of the frequency response. Although both groups responded to hypoxia with a shortening in inspiratory and expiratory times, rats treated with capsaicin displayed less shortening of both respiratory phases. By contrast, hypercapnia induced a brisk ventilatory response in the capsaicin-treated group that was similar in magnitude and pattern to that observed in the vehicle-treated group. Analysis of the components of the hypercapnic ventilatory responses revealed no significant differences between the two groups. We, therefore, conclude that neuropeptide-containing C-fibers are essential for the tachypnic component of the ventilatory response to hypoxia but not hypercapnia. \nLate variation in ventricular function after myocardial infarction. To assess the possible role of variables not related to early infarct artery reperfusion in predicting late changes in ventricular function after infarction, paired early (mean 6.6 +/- 3.5 days after admission) and late (12.7 +/- 7.0 months later) cross-sectional echocardiograms from 54 infarction survivors were retrospectively reviewed. Ejection fraction was calculated from digitized biapical echocardiographic views on a graphics tablet. Changes of 0.10 or more in LVEF were correlated with 23 clinical variables. By stepwise regression analysis, Q-wave infarction and low early LVEF independently predicted late improvement in function. Early high LVEF and interval infarction were the only independent predictors of late declines in function. Overall, when patients were indexed by early left ventricular systolic function, a pronounced late \"regression to the mean\" was noted with initially high values tending to fall and low values to rise (r = -0.44, p less than 0.001). This effect must be accounted for in any acute intervention trial in myocardial infarction. The occurrence of Q-wave infarction does not exclude late improvement in ventricular function. \nProliferation and cytolytic function of anti-CD3 + interleukin-2 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells following bone marrow transplantation. We evaluated the proliferation, cytolytic function, and phenotypic characteristics of anti-CD3 plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 44 patients with leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with multiagent chemotherapy or following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). BMT patients had decreased cell growth with only a 1.35 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), 1.24 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for NHL), and 0.8 +/- 0.1 (allogeneic BMT for leukemia) mean fold increase by day 5 of culture compared with controls (4.0 +/- 0.4), P less than .001. Anti-CD3 + IL-2 activated cells from patients with ALL and NHL who had received autologous BMT and cells from patients with leukemia who underwent allogeneic BMT were more effective in lysing the natural killer (NK) sensitive target, K562, and the NK-resistant target, Daudi, compared with controls. In contrast, cytolysis of K562 and Daudi by cultured PBMCs from patients with ALL and NHL receiving multi-agent chemotherapy was similar to that of controls. Cultures from BMT recipients had a significant increase in CD16+ (autologous ALL 5.7 +/- 1.5%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 12.4 +/- 3.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 14.3 +/- 2.9%, P less than .001) and CD56+ cells (autologous ALL 27.6 +/- 12.0%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 39.3 +/- 9.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 42.7 +/- 7.4%, P less than .001) compared with controls (CD16+ 2.5 +/- 0.4%; CD56+ 6.9 +/- 0.9%). Stimulation of PBMCs with anti-CD3 + IL-2 is effective in generating cells with high cytolytic function post-BMT. \nMesenteric infarction secondary to tumor emboli from primary aortic sarcoma. Guidelines for diagnosis and management. Primary aortic tumors are rare, difficult to diagnose, and often fatal. This case and a review of the literature identified aortic tumors as a potential source of emboli leading to acute mesenteric insufficiency. The case showed the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing and determining the extent and location of an aortic tumor. \nTumor cell invasion inhibited by TIMP-2 The 72-kd type IV collagenase is a member of the collagenase enzyme family that has been closely linked with the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that both normal cells and highly invasive tumor cells produce the 72-kd type IV procollagenase enzyme in a complexed form consisting of the proenzyme and a novel tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, TIMP-2. The balance between activated enzyme and available inhibitor is thought to be a critical determinant of the matrix proteolysis associated with a variety of pathologic processes, including tumor cell invasion. In the present study, we demonstrate that alteration of the metalloproteinase-metalloproteinase-inhibitor balance in favor of excess inhibitor blocks human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 tumor cell invasion of a reconstituted basement membrane. The HT-1080 cell line produces both the 72-kd and the 92-kd type IV collagenases. Alteration of the type IV collagenase-inhibitor balance was achieved by addition of free TIMP-2 or antibodies to 72-kd type IV collagenase. Native, purified TIMP-2 was inhibitory in the range of 1-25 micrograms/mL. Addition of specific antiserum against the 72-kd type IV collagenase, which did not cross-react with the 92-kd type IV collagenase, inhibited HT-1080 cell invasion to the same extent. These results suggest that metalloproteinases, in particular the 72-kd type IV collagenase, are critical for tumor cell invasion of the reconstituted basement membrane. Our findings demonstrate that addition of the endogenous inhibitor TIMP-2 is able to block invasion. Thus, we recommend initiation of in vivo studies of the therapeutic potential of TIMP-2 to block tumor cell invasion and intravasation into the circulation. \nLoad dependence of the effective regurgitant orifice area in a sheep model of aortic regurgitation. Treatment of patients with aortic regurgitation with vasodilators reduces regurgitant volume, ventricular dilation and left ventricular mass. Although these effects are presumably due to afterload reduction, it is also possible that the aortic regurgitant orifice area is not constant. To test the latter hypothesis, aortic regurgitation was created in 10 open chest sheep by partial resection of the noncoronary leaflet under direct visualization. Regurgitant flow was measured with an aortic supravalvular electromagnetic probe; aortic and left ventricular pressures were measured with catheter-tipped micromanometer pressure transducers. The effective regurgitant orifice area was calculated by a modification of the continuity equation in a manner similar to the Gorlin equation. The regurgitant orifice area was measured three times: after aortic regurgitation was created, after mean arterial pressure was increased by 15 to 25 mm Hg with intravenous dopamine and after mean arterial pressure was reduced by 15 to 25 mm Hg with intravenous sodium nitroprusside. Comparison of regurgitant volumes and areas obtained after creation of aortic regurgitation and at the conclusion of the experiment in the absence of dopamine or sodium nitroprusside demonstrated no significant change over time. Dopamine administration was associated with an 86 +/- 81% increase in regurgitant volume (p less than 0.01) and a 38 +/- 44% increase in regurgitant orifice area (p less than 0.01). Sodium nitroprusside administration resulted in a 51 +/- 14% decrease in regurgitant volume (p less than 0.001) and a 28 +/- 21% reduction in regurgitant orifice area (p = 0.007). In this model of acute aortic regurgitation, the effective regurgitant orifice area was altered by increasing or decreasing the aortic transvalvular pressure gradient. \nPrimary angiosarcoma of the central nervous system. Study of eight cases and review of the literature. Angiosarcoma arising in the central or peripheral nervous system has rarely been reported. Eight patients with primary angiosarcoma of the central nervous system are described here; these included five males and three females ranging in age from 2 weeks to 72 years (mean 38 years). Of the eight neoplasms, six were located in the cerebral hemispheres and one was in the meninges; the site was unknown in the other. All patients underwent surgical resection. Five of the eight patients died, four within 4 months after surgery and one after 30 months. Two of the remaining three patients were 17 and 27 years old at the time of diagnosis and were alive at follow-up review 39 and 102 months after surgery, respectively. One patient was lost to follow-up monitoring. Microscopically, all eight tumors demonstrated a well-differentiated pattern with irregular vascular channels and intraluminal papillae; in addition, four showed poorly differentiated solid areas. Immunohistochemical staining of neoplastic cells to factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I was performed in five tumors and was focally positive in four. No correlation could be shown between the histological features and the growth and biological behavior of the tumors. \nVerapamil in the treatment of maternal paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is seen somewhat frequently in the emergency department but less frequently during pregnancy. Although verapamil is widely used as the drug of choice for PSVT with a narrow QRS complex in a hemodynamically stable patient, the acute IV use of verapamil during pregnancy has not been well studied. Only a limited number of case reports document its safety and efficacy in the treatment of maternal or fetal PSVT. In general, the use of medication during pregnancy requires careful assessment of both the maternal and fetal risks versus benefits and documentation of patient consent. Because it crosses the placenta, one of the major concerns with the acute use of IV verapamil centers around the drug's potential effect on fetal heart rate. The case we present describes the occurrence of PSVT on two separate occasions in a woman in the third trimester of pregnancy. In both episodes, as much as 10 mg IV verapamil was given with resulting successful conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Fetal heart monitoring during drug administration failed to show significant change in fetal heart rate. \nMeningitis from canine Pasteurella multocida following mastoidectomy. A case of Pasteurella multocida meningitis, following a mastoidectomy is presented. The association of close contact with pets, many of which harbour Pasteurella multocida as part of their normal buccal flora. This case confirms the potential benefit of taking an ear swab prior to mastoid surgery and in seeking an appropriate 'pet' history. \nDislodgement of a vein graft thrombus by angiographic injection of native coronary artery. A case of retrograde dislodgement of thrombus in a saphenous vein graft during injection of the native right coronary artery is presented. Attention to this previously undescribed complication may allow for timely treatment with emergency surgery or thrombolysis. \nMultifactorial analysis of fertility after conservative laparoscopic treatment of ectopic pregnancy in a series of 223 patients. OBJECTIVES: To lay down the criteria to clearly define whether conservative or radical laparoscopic treatment should be adopted in cases of ectopic pregnancies (EP). DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative. SETTING: At the University Hospital of Clermont Ferrand and the La Pergola Clinic at Vichy from July 1974 to December 1987. PATIENTS: This study was carried out in 223 patients who had been treated laparoscopically for EP and who desired future childbearing and who were not lost to follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The measures chosen to achieve the objective included age, parity, size of hematosalpinx, volume of hemoperitoneum, tubal rupture, location, intrauterine device, ipsilateral and contralateral adhesions, and patient's previous history of salpingitis, EP, solitary tube, and tubal infertility. RESULTS: The general intrauterine pregnancy rate was 67% (149 patients) and the recurrence rate 12% (27 patients). The results according to the studied factors demonstrated that age, parity, and the type of the EP have no influence on the postectopic fertility. The history of the patient, ipsilateral adhesions, or contralateral tubal status significantly reduce the future fertility prognosis and risk of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: From a multivariable analysis, the authors propose a scoring system to choose the most suitable treatment to preserve fertility and to reduce the risk of recurrence ranging from laparoscopic conservative treatment to laparoscopic salpingectomy with contralateral sterilization. \nEpidemiology and evaluation: steps toward hypertension treatment in the 1990s. The percentage of persons in the United States over age 65--especially over 85--is increasing more rapidly than other age groups. Two thirds of people over age 65 have blood pressure higher than 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic. Isolated systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) is also highly prevalent. In a number of clinical trials, treatment of diastolic hypertension in the elderly has been shown to be beneficial, although the value of treatment of isolated systolic hypertension is not yet established. The benefit of antihypertensive therapy on the incidence of stroke and heart failure has been clearly established, but prevention of the atherosclerotic complications of high blood pressure (sudden death or myocardial infarction, for example) has not been convincingly demonstrated. Since clinical trials designed to investigate this atherosclerotic complication of hypertension have relied on stepped-care regimens (diuretics and beta blockers), the question arises whether the use of different drugs might have a better effect on prevention of myocardial infarction. The basis for this supposition includes the known adverse effects of diuretics and beta blockers on electrolytes, lipid metaboli",
