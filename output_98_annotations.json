        "text": "ities, hemorrhages and/or microaneurysms, and venous beading were found to be the most important factors in predicting progression. On the basis of these analyses and other considerations, a retinopathy severity scale was developed. This scale, which divides diabetic retinopathy into 13 levels ranging from absence of retinopathy to severe vitreous hemorrhage, can be used to describe overall retinopathy severity and change in severity over time. \nEffectiveness of histopathological diagnoses in dysfunction of hepatic transplantation. Review of 146 histopathological studies from 53 transplants. In 47 patients who underwent 53 liver transplantations and immunosuppression with cyclosporine (cyclosporin A), methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and antithymocyte globulin, 146 histopathological studies were performed (138 biopsies, six hepatectomies, and two autopsies). The following microscopical diagnoses were made: 43 acute rejections (29.4%), six chronic rejections (4.1%), 18 liver blood perfusion changes (12.3%), 15 biliary changes (10.2%), 10 cases of functional cholestasis (6.8%), two drug reactions (1.3%), two hepatitis B virus recurrences (1.3%), 11 opportunistic viral infections (7.5%), 18 minimal changes (12.3%), two nonclassifiable changes (1.3%), and 19 plurietiological changes (13%). A histopathological diagnosis of acute rejection was made in 31 transplants (58.4%). In 22 (71%) of them, acute rejection was diagnosed with the protocol biopsy specimen that was obtained during the second posttransplant week. Leukocyte counts and serum bilirubin and enzyme levels were obtained on the same day that the hepatic biopsy specimens were taken. There was no significant statistical difference between the mean serum data that accompanied each histopathological diagnosis, allowing identification of a characteristic biochemical profile for the causes of graft dysfunction. We report a detailed description of the microscopical findings of each diagnosis and the following conclusions: (1) Acute rejection is the most frequent cause of hepatic dysfunction and has an early appearance during the posttransplant period. (2) Histopathological findings can identify the causes of the dysfunction. (3) There is no specific biochemical pattern to differentiate these causes. This may be due to the frequent combination of etiological factors in every dysfunction episode. \nSafety of surgical procedures performed by residents. The outcome of surgical procedures on the gallbladder performed by surgical residents in a university hospital was compared with the outcome of those performed by the attending staff. More than 60% of the operations (643/1084) were done by residents under the direct supervision of the attending surgeon. We found no differences in the rate of technical complications, postoperative morbidity and mortality, or length of hospitalization between the two groups. Thus, resident surgery under appropriate guidance is safe and does not compromise the quality of patient care or operative outcome. \nLow-dose chemotherapy with central nervous system prophylaxis and zidovudine maintenance in AIDS-related lymphoma. A prospective multi-institutional trial. OBJECTIVE.--To ascertain if low-dose multiagent chemotherapy, with central nervous system prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy, might be associated with increased efficacy and decreased risk of intercurrent infection in patients with malignant lymphoma related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN.--A phase II prospective clinical trial, with median follow-up of 33 months. SETTING.--Eight university hospitals, within the context of the AIDS Clinical Trials Units, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. PATIENTS.--Forty-two patients with AIDS-related malignant lymphoma. All were evaluable for toxicity assessment, and 35 for response. INTERVENTION.--A low-dose modification of the M-BACOD regimen (day 1): cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2 intravenously (IV); doxorubicin, 25 mg/m2 IV; vincristine sulfate, 1.4 mg/m2 IV; bleomycin, 4 mg/m2 IV; dexamethasone, 3 mg/m2 orally on days 1 through 5; methotrexate, 500 mg/m2 IV on day 15, with leucovorin rescue. Intrathecal cytosine arabinoside (50 mg) to all on days 1, 8, 21, and 28, with radiation therapy to a helmet field to those with central nervous system involvement. Zidovudine for 12 months after completion of four to six cycles of chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Response rate and number of opportunistic infections. RESULTS.--Response rate was 51% with a complete response of 46%. Of 16 complete responses, relapse occurred in four, none isolated to the central nervous system. Opportunistic infections occurred in 21% of those receiving treatment. Median duration of survival among all 42 patients is 5.6 months, 6.5 months in 35 patients evaluable for response, and 15 months in patients with complete response. Lower concentration of CD4 cells, history of prior AIDS, bone marrow involvement, and stage IV disease were independently associated with decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS.--Low-dose chemotherapy with central nervous system prophylaxis and zidovudine maintenance may be associated with durable remissions in AIDS-related lymphoma with fewer opportunistic infections than noted in prior reports. \nIntracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and subdural hematoma after acute myocardial infarction and thrombolytic therapy in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II, pilot and clinical trial. In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II pilot and clinical trial, 908 patients [326 (35.9%) in the pilot study and 582 (64.0%) in the randomized study] were treated with 150 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen (rt-PA) activator in combination with heparin and aspirin, and 3,016 patients [64 (2.1%) in the pilot study and 2,952 (97.9%) in the randomized study] were treated with 100 mg rt-PA in combination with heparin and aspirin. Adverse neurological events occurred in 23 patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (2.5%) [nine cerebral infarctions (1.0%), 12 intracerebral hemorrhages (1.3%), and two subdural hematomas (0.2%)] and in 33 patients treated with 100 mg rt-PA (1.1%) [20 cerebral infarctions (0.7%), 11 intracerebral hemorrhages (0.4%), and two subdural hematomas (0.1%)]. The difference in adverse neurological events observed comparing the two rt-PA regimens was primarily due to a higher frequency of intracerebral bleeding among patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (1.3% versus 0.4%, p less than 0.01). Patients with recent (within 6 months) histories of stroke were not eligible for the study, and patients with any history of cerebrovascular disease were declared ineligible early in the study. The small number of patients (89, or 2.3%) with any history of neurological disease, intermittent cerebral ischemic attacks, or stroke who were enrolled before the stricter eligibility criteria were imposed or on the basis of incomplete baseline information experienced an increased frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage compared with patients without such histories (3.4% versus 0.5%). Mortality at 6 weeks after presentation among 23 patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage was 47.8%. Intracerebral hemorrhage is a severe but infrequent complication of rt-PA therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The combined frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and cerebral infarction after treatment with 100 mg rt-PA is comparable to that observed in other trials with thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial infarction. \nAnnular colon lipoma: a case report and review of the literature. Colonic lipomas are generally mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic pedunculated or sessile polyps, although they have been reported to cause intussusception or significant bleeding. The difficulty in differentiation is primarily with adenomatous polyps. We describe the unique case of a symptomatic annular colon lipoma simulating an annular colon carcinoma. \nAn investigation into the etiology of irritable hip. A prospective review has been made of 111 children who presented with acute hip pain to determine it's etiology and assess the need for multiple investigations at presentation. There was no clinical hematological, serological or bacteriological evidence to identify positively patients with an irritable hip, neither was there good correlation with a history of infection. An effusion was diagnosed by ultrasound in 71% but there were no factors, either clinically or by investigation, to differentiate between patients with or without an effusion. We conclude that multiple investigations to find a source of infection in patients with irritable hip are not warranted as they are rarely positive, seldom affect management and are of no help in investigating the etiology of irritable hip. \nNational surveillance of dialysis-associated diseases in the United States, 1989. To determine trends in a variety of dialysis-associated diseases and practices, the Centers for Disease Control surveyed 1,867 chronic hemodialysis centers in the United States in 1989 in conjunction with the annual facility survey performed by the Health Care Financing Administration. The response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 92%. These 1,726 centers represented 122,734 patients and 32,486 staff members. The following results were found. 1) During the last 14 years, the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection decreased from 3.0 to 0.1% among patients, and from 2.6 to 0.1% among staff members. Over the same time, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity declined from 7.8 to 1.4% among patients and from 0.9 to 0.3% among staff members. Hepatitis B vaccine was given by 92% of the centers. By the end of 1989, 19% of susceptible patients and 55% of susceptible staff members had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. From 1982 to 1989, as a result of receiving vaccine, the prevalence of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) increased from 12 to 19% among patients and from 18 to 54% among staff. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1989 was reported to be 0.7% among patients and 0.1% among staff members. 2) Twenty-two percent of the centers reported pyrogenic reactions in the absence of septicemia among their patients, and 51% reported septicemia. 3) The reported incidence of dialysis dementia among hemodialysis patients was 0.2%, with a case fatality rate of 23%. 4) In 1989, 68% of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers; these centers treated 73% of the dialysis patient population. Among centers that reused disposable dialyzers, the average number of reuses ranged from 1 to 50 (mean, 12) and the maximum number of times a disposable dialyzer was ever reused ranged from 3 to 150 (mean, 28). Chemical germicides used for reprocessing dialyzers included formaldehyde, Renalin (a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based germicide), and glutaraldehyde-based germicides. Reuse of disposable dialyzers was not associated with any increased risk of acquiring HBV infection among either patients or staff. However, pyrogenic reactions occurring in clusters were reported more frequently in centers that reused conventional dialyzer membranes compared with centers that did not. This increased risk was associated only with centers that used Renalin or glutaraldehyde for reprocessing (not formaldehyde) and occurred with both automated and manual reprocessing systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nCutaneous lymphomas of phenotypically undetermined lineage: contribution of genotypic analysis. Genotypic analyses were performed in six primary cutaneous lymphomas whose lineage could not be assessed on the basis of histologic and phenotypic data. By immunophenotyping, these neoplasms expressed leukocyte common antigen and HLA-DR but did not show consistent immunostaining for B-cell or T-cell differentiation antigens. Expression of nonspecific histiocytic markers such as lysozyme and alpha 1-antitrypsin was found in three cases. By genotyping, three cases retained a germline configuration and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was observed in one case, T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was found in one case, and both types of rearrangements in one case. Of the three patients in whom gene rearrangements were noted, two rapidly died and the other patient, with a dual genotype, is still alive 15 years after diagnosis. The three patients without gene rearrangements are alive and well after a mean follow-up of 2.5 years. It appears that cutaneous lymphomas with an uncertain phenotype include at least some cases of authentic B-cell or T-cell lymphomas. The germline configuration that we observed in cases with a chronic course remains difficult to explain. It may be related to a low malignancy form of histiocytic lymphoma, an atypical polyclonal hyperplasia, or even a low-grade lymphoma arising from a primitive cell without established commitment to either B- or T-cell lineage. \nDecreased oxyhemoglobin affinity in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. Oxyhemogloblin affinity (P50 at pH 7.4, PaCO2 = 40 mm Hg, temperature = 37 degrees C) and 2,3-DPG concentration were assessed in 15 nonsmokers (14 men and one woman 46 to 63 yr of age) with sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) and in 10 normal subjects (eight men and two women 22 to 48 yr of age). In patients with SAS, mean nocturnal apnea index was 46 +/- 20/h, and mean nocturnal SO2 was 86 +/- 6% versus 94.6 +/- 1.8% during the daytime. Daytime mean P50 of the patients was 28.5 +/- 1.2 mm Hg versus 27.1 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the normal subjects (p less than 0.05). Daytime mean 2.3-DPG was 1.23 +/- 0.25 moles DPG/mole hemoglobin versus 0.80 +/- 0.15 (p less than 0.05). Significant correlations were found in patients between P50 and mean nocturnal SO2 (r = -0.62, p less than 0.01) and between P50 and 2,3-DPG (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01). The measurements were repeated in five patients after surgical or positive-pressure treatment. P50 and 2,3-DPG both decreased and returned to normal values. In conclusion, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the right in patients with SAS and there is an increase in 2,3-DPG. These could be protective mechanisms against the development of polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale. \nQuantitative determination of acid-labile DNA in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Using a modified Feulgen hydrolysis procedure and integrating microdensitometry, the acid-labile nuclear DNA in exfoliated cervical epithelial cells was quantified in a range of histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), invasive cancer, and normal controls. The mean relative optical densities obtained for each sample group showed an increase from normal epithelium, through CIN grades, to invasive cancer. Although there was some overlap between groups, the difference in the overall mean values between the adjacent groups was statistically significant. The sensitivity of the test was 87.1% with a specificity of 99.2% and a predictive value of 99.5%, with no false negatives in the severe dysplasia and cancer groups. Quantitative data allows the threshold value to be altered to vary the sensitivity and specificity according to prevailing requirements. This suggests the possibility of using quantitative acid-labile DNA measurements to improve existing screening for cervical precancer. \nSelective spinal panangiography: use of a 4-F braided catheter with a soft-tip configuration. A 4-F braided catheter with a soft radiopaque tip was used in selective spinal panangiographic procedures. Results obtained with the catheter were compared with those obtained in procedures with conventional catheters. The catheter was used in the intercostal, lumbar, and sacral arteries. Advantages of using this catheter include excellent maneuverability, reduced patient exposure to contrast medium, and reduced fluoroscopy duration. \nCerebrospinal fluid atrial natriuretic factor in intracranial disease. We tested the hypothesis that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is an indicator of brain injury in patients with intracranial disease. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was measured in 72 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 28 patients with intraventricular drains and in nine samples from outpatient controls undergoing diagnostic lumbar puncture. Levels were correlated with diagnosis; systemic fluid administration; concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma; intracranial pressure; sodium, glucose, and protein concentrations, osmolality, and cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid; sodium concentration in the serum; and hemodynamics. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was highest in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with intracerebral hematoma, followed by those with obstructive hydrocephalus and subarachnoid hemorrhage (19 +/- 2, 13 +/- 3, and 8 +/- 2 pg/ml, respectively); atrial natriuretic factor concentration was less than 4 pg/ml in the controls. Patients treated with fluid restriction had significantly higher atrial natriuretic factor levels than those receiving maintenance or high-volume fluids (16 +/- 3, 8 +/- 2, 10 +/- 1 pg/ml, respectively). The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma was significantly elevated in patients with intracerebral hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage (155 +/- 38 and 92 +/- 20 pg/ml, respectively) and did not correlate with fluid administration or the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid. Neither cerebrospinal fluid nor plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor correlated with intracranial pressure; cerebrospinal fluid sodium, glucose, or protein concentrations, osmolality, or cell count; serum sodium concentration; or hemodynamics. We conclude that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is a nonspecific indicator of brain injury. \nAxillosubclavian vein thrombosis: case report. Deep-vein thrombosis of the upper extremity, that is, axillosubclavian vein thrombosis, is a relatively rare and potentially overlooked diagnosis in the emergency department (ED). It can be the cause of significant morbidity and it may be life-threatening. Reported here is the case of a 23-year-old man who presented to the ED with left upper extremity pain and swelling. Venography confirmed the diagnosis of axillosubclavian vein thrombosis. Hospitalization and treatment with intravenous heparin led to a satisfactory recovery. The clinical presentation, predisposing factors, diagnosis, treatment, and complications of this rare entity are discussed. \nQuantitative sensory testing before and after regional guanethidine block in patients with neuralgia in the hand. Using reference values from healthy volunteers, thermal and vibration-induced pain thresholds and the sensibility for warm and cold were studied in 18 patients with neuralgia in one hand following a traumatic injury or surgery. All patients had spontaneous pain and allodynia to vibration. They were treated with intravenous regional guanethidine block (RGB). Quantitative sensory testing was performed on both hands before and 1-3 days after treatment. Eleven patients benefitted considerably from the block, with pain relief for 2 weeks or more. Ten of these 11 patients had mild nerve injuries caused by compressive trauma to the nerve. Before RGB they showed a moderate loss in temperature discrimination capacity; their heat pain thresholds were reduced and they exhibited allodynia to cold and vibration on the injured side. After RGB, the pain thresholds were normalised both to thermal and vibratory stimuli. These patients were classified as having sympathetically maintained pain (SMP). Seven patients reported no or only minor pain-relieving effect of RGB lasting 1-5 days. Severe nerve injuries were most frequent in this group of patients. On the injured side, before RGB, their ability to discriminate between warm and cold was markedly impaired, thermal pain thresholds were normal, and they showed allodynia to vibration. After RGB, there was no change in thermal pain thresholds and the allodynia to vibration persisted. These patients were classified as having sympathetically independent pain (SIP). The results indicate that quantitative thermal sensory tests, together with clinical evaluation of the nerve trauma, can help to predict which patients will have long-lasting pain alleviation after RGB treatment. \nDiagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct: usefulness of lymphangiography and CT. The usefulness of lymphangiography and CT in the diagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct was evaluated in 12 patients with chylothorax or chylous ascites after surgery. Bipedal lymphangiography was performed in all 12 patients. The last four patients studied also had CT after lymphangiography. Seven patients had abnormal findings on lymphangiograms; five with leaks from the thoracic duct, one with a lymphocele in a nephrectomy bed, and one with obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels after thoracotomy. Five patients had no evidence of lymphatic leakage. CT in one patient with evidence of a leak on lymphangiography showed extravasation of contrast medium into the mediastinum and pleural space. CT in three patients with no abnormalities on lymphangiography also showed no abnormalities. Four of the five thoracic duct lacerations and the lymphocele were confirmed surgically. The diagnosis of obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels was supported clinically. Four of the five patients with normal findings on lymphangiograms had resolution of their pleural effusions and no evidence of recurrence during a follow-up period of 1-27 months. One patient with normal findings on lymphangiography had an alternative diagnosis established at surgery. Laceration of the thoracic duct was accurately diagnosed and localized with lymphangiography, which allowed definitive surgical repair. CT was of little additional value in diagnosing these injuries. \nA comparative trial of LC9018 plus doxorubicin and doxorubicin alone for the treatment of malignant pleural effusion secondary to lung cancer. The efficacy and safety of intrapleural LC9018 (Yakult Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with or without doxorubicin (Adriamycin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) were evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial performed in 95 patients with malignant pleural effusions secondary to lung cancer. Seventy-six patients were eligible for the assessment of efficacy. The response rate for treatment with intrapleural doxorubicin plus LC9018 (38 patients) was 73.7%, which was significantly higher than the response rate of 39.5% for the control group treated with doxorubicin alone (38 patients) (P less than 0.01). The LC9018 group also showed a significantly greater improvement in performance status (PS) and symptoms (chest pain, chest discomfort, and anorexia) than the control group (P less than 0.05). A significant prolongation of survival was noticed in the LC9018 group (P less than 0.05). The main side effects of LC9018 were fever and transient hepatic dysfunction, but there were no serious adverse reactions. These results suggest that the intrapleural instillation of LC9018 can be recommended for the treatment of malignant pleural effusions. \nImpact of intensified therapy on clinical outcome in infants and children with neuroblastoma: the St Jude Children's Research Hospital experience, 1962 to 1988. To gauge the impact of intensified therapy on the survival of infants (younger than 1 year, n = 129) and children (greater than or equal to 1 year of age, n = 275) with neuroblastoma, we analyzed the results of eight successive clinical trials comparing various combinations of antineoplastic drugs, surgery, and radiotherapy. Changes in treatment did not affect the survival of children with involved noncontiguous lymph nodes or distant metastatic disease until the combination of cisplatin and teniposide (CDDP/VM26) was added to a basic regimen of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (CTX/DOX). The resulting 4-year survival was 28% +/- 5% (SE) compared with 7% +/- 2% for previous treatments (P less than .001 by the log-rank test). The 4-year survival of infants with metastatic disease was improved by administering CTX/DOX to all patients, reserving CDDP/VM26 for those whose disease was resistant to the former combination: 82% +/- 6% versus 45% +/- 8% in earlier studies; P less than .001. In the subset of infants whose tumors had disseminated to bone or bone marrow at diagnosis, this therapeutic approach increased the probability of long-term survival from 48% +/- 10% to 85% +/- 9% (P = .01). The small group of children over 1 year of age with localized unresectable tumors also fared significantly better with the switch to CTX/DOX chemotherapy (4-year survival, 93% +/- 7% v 42% +/- 13%; P = .02). Multivariate analysis indicated that young age, limited-disease stage, nonadrenal primary site, and intensified treatment were independent predictors of a more favorable outcome. We conclude that substantial advances in the treatment of neuroblastoma have occurred over the past 25 years at this institution. The current overall 4-year survival probability of 57% +/- 4% compares favorably with estimates for most other common solid tumors of childhood. \nMycotic aneurysms of the carotid arteries--case report and review of the literature. Mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries are rare. We report a new case with a mycotic aneurysm of the carotid bifurcation associated with acute bacterial endocarditis of the aortic valve. A concomitant treatment of both lesions was performed. Twenty-six cases of mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries have been reported in the literature. We present a review of all these cases. \nEndoprosthetic replacement for stage IIB osteosarcoma. Over an eight-year period, 100 patients with IIB osteosarcoma have been managed. Eighty-one were treated with limb-salvage procedures, 78 of which involved reconstruction utilizing endoprostheses. Only 19 patients received amputation as the primary treatment for local control. Since 1984, all patients received preoperative and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. Those patients who received chemotherapy had a statistically significant improvement in five-year survival over those who did not (57% and 32%, respectively, p = 0.014). The functional results were good overall, with excellent results seen in distal femoral reconstruction. Twenty-eight of the 78 patients treated with endoprosthetic reconstruction experienced 30 complications (36%). Mechanical failure was the most common complication (10%) but was generally correctable. The local recurrence rate was 5% and the infection rate was 3%. Local complications were manageable. A statistical analysis revealed that the relative risk of patient death was 2.5 times higher than prosthesis failure for the 78 patients with endoprosthetic reconstruction. The intermediate-term results, with a median follow-up period of 43 months, remains encouraging. \nRegional myocardial function after repetitive brief episodes of ischemia: effect of altering the duration of the reperfusion period. How recovery of regional contractile function in myocardium is influenced by alterations in the duration of reperfusion after repetitive brief coronary artery occlusions was investigated in chronically instrumented, conscious dogs. All animals underwent five 5 minute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusions with a final 5-hour reperfusion period. Dogs were randomly assigned to one of three groups determined by the duration of reperfusion (5, 10, or 15 minutes) between successive 5-minute occlusion periods. A shortening of the duration of the reperfusion period between occlusions led to reduced recovery and progressive deterioration in systolic shortening after multiple occlusion-reperfusion sequences. With 15-minute reperfusion periods, the percentage of segment shortening (%SS) during the first through fourth reperfusion periods ranged from 17.1 +/- 2.6% to 18.2 +/- 1.8% and did not differ from the preocclusion control value (18.8 +/- 1.7%) by the end of the final reperfusion period. In contrast, in those dogs with 5-minute reperfusion periods, %SS was significantly reduced from the preocclusion control value (20.2 +/- 2.2%) at the completion of the final 5-hour reperfusion period (11.4 +/- 1.5%). Results of the present study indicate that after only a few brief periods of coronary artery occlusion, rapid and cumulative deterioration in regional contractile function can occur when the duration of intermittent reperfusion is sufficiently brief. \nDistribution of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) in the liver and portal lymph nodes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis: an immunohistochemical study. The reason for the close association between primary biliary cirrhosis and the appearance of antibodies that recognize the E2 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is not understood. The distribution of the three pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunits was examined in the liver and lymph nodes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, patients with other liver diseases and normal subjects by immunohistochemistry using affinity-purified antibodies. Intensity of staining was assessed semiquantitatively and validated by scanning laser confocal microscopy. In primary biliary cirrhosis tissue, the E2 staining pattern did not parallel the reported distribution of mitochondria. E2 staining in biliary epithelial cells was consistently stronger than in hepatocytes. In primary biliary cirrhotic liver, staining of biliary epithelium was significantly stronger than in normal or other liver disease controls; many bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhotic liver demonstrated very high intensity, diffuse distribution of stain. No differences in staining intensity were seen between perivenular hepatocytes in primary biliary cirrhotic liver and those in controls; periportal hepatocytes in primary biliary cirrhotic liver were, however, more intensely stained than perivenular cells. In primary biliary cirrhotic portal lymph nodes, a subset of macrophages showed high-intensity, diffuse distribution of stain. By contrast, staining with antibodies to E1 and E3 (other components of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) produced uniform-intensity, mitochondrial distribution both in primary biliary cirrhosis and control tissue. The increased intensity of E2 in primary biliary cirrhotic tissue could be explained in terms of abnormal metabolism of E2 by biliary epithelial cells. \nCardiovascular collapse following orthoclone OKT3 administration: a case report. Orthoclone OKT3 has been described to have significant adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, including pulmonary edema, angina, dysrhythmias, hypertension, and hypotension, usually following the first or second doses of the drug. We describe a case of cardiopulmonary arrest in a patient 1 minute after the initial injection of OKT3. Two subsequent doses were successfully administered with the guidance of hemodynamic monitoring, which showed profound, immediate effects of OKT3 on the cardiovascular system. Potential mechanisms of these effects are discussed. \nLong-term follow-up of children with testicular tumours: surgical issues. Testicular tumours are rare in childhood. The clinical, pathological and follow-up details of 48 children are presented. The combined approach of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy is confirmed as being extremely effective. Transcrotal orchiectomy is not an appropriate surgical procedure. Testicular biopsy is detrimental to prognosis. \nImpaired heart rate variability in patients with chronic Chagas' disease. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability was used to investigate the possible alteration in sympathovagal control of heart rate in patients with Chagas' disease. The study included 31 subjects, divided into three groups: controls, Chagas' 1 (subjects with only positive serology for Chagas' disease) and Chagas' 2 (subjects with positive serology and electrocardiographic abnormalities that are usually found in this disease). The subjects were studied during rest, while standing, and during handgrip exercise. With this approach, the low frequency (approximately 0.1 Hz) spectral component of R-R interval variability is considered to be a marker primarily of sympathetic activity, whereas the high frequency (approximately 0.25 Hz) component, which is related to respiration, seems mainly to reflect vagal activity. We observed significant (p less than 0.05) differences among the three groups during standing: although in the control subjects the low-frequency component increased (delta = 30 +/- 5 normalized units, nu), there was no increase in Chagas' 1 (delta = -1 +/- 8 nu) and Chagas' 2 (delta = -2 +/- 8 nu) patients. During handgrip exercise, another test that is capable of exciting sympathetic outflow, there was an increase of low frequency only in control subjects. These results confirm the occurrence of quantitative and assessable abnormalities in the neural control of heart rate variability in Argentinian patients with chronic Chagas' disease, even in the absence of heart failure. \nClinical outcome and health care costs in renal revascularization--percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty versus reconstructive surgery. Clinical outcome and health care costs related to investigation, treatment with either percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) or reconstructive surgery, and follow-up of patients with renovascular hypertension with or without uraemia were analysed in 21 PTRA-treated and 16 operated patients. Most renal artery stenoses were atherosclerotic. Nineteen PTRAs were successful or partly successful and two failed; the patients were operated on without delay. All surgical reconstructions were successful. In the PTRA group six restenoses occurred after 4-24 months. Four were treated with re-PTRA and two were operated on. No recurrence occurred in the operated group. At the end of follow-up (median 48, range 9-84 months) primary patency in the PTRA group was 69 per cent and in the operated group 100 per cent. Secondary patency in the PTRA group was 100 per cent. With regard to hypertension, including primary and secondary results, 19 out of 21 (90 per cent) patients were improved in the PTRA group and 13 out of 16 (81 per cent) in the operated group. The diagnostic and preprocedure costs were the same in both groups, whereas the procedure and postprocedure costs were lower in the PTRA group. However, the follow-up costs were considerably higher because of recurrences and their treatment in the PTRA group. The total median cost of reconstructive surgery was 12 per cent higher than for PTRA, a non-significant difference. \nKinetics of T cell activation in acute and chronic forms of murine graft-versus-host disease. Induction of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in the parent-into-F1 model is dependent on the presence of T cells in the donor inoculum. Although in vivo activation of donor T cells in response to F1 alloantigens is thought to be critical to GVHD induction, direct evidence of activated donor T cells has been lacking in this model. In the present study, spleen cells from acute or chronic GVHD mice were studied for evidence of T cell activation at multiple intervals early after GVHD induction. Spleen cells from both acute and chronic GVHD mice exhibited striking elevations in spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production, which were maximal 24 to 48 h after GVHD induction. Persistent lower levels of spontaneous in vitro activity were observed for spleen cells from mice tested 7 to 9 days after GVHD induction. In both forms of GVHD, increased spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production were dependent on the presence of donor CD4+ T cells. These results strongly support the presence of activated donor T cells in vivo. Furthermore, these data imply that despite the significant differences in outcome, acute and chronic GVHD share a common early event. \nCerebrovascular disease in hypertensive blacks. There is convincing evidence that all grades of persistent diastolic hypertension, especially in blacks, should be treated in order to prevent stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Studies are now in progress to gather additional information concerning isolated systolic hypertension, especially in the aged. Inasmuch as at least one half or more of stroke deaths in blacks develop as the result of hypertension, lowering blood pressure offers the perfect opportunity to reduce considerably the frequency of this devastating illness. The recent dramatic fall in U.S. stroke mortality, greatest in the black female, is a commendable achievement, but the flattening of the declining mortality curve over the past several years should be a cause for alarm and intensive investigation. \nMycobacterium fortuitum presenting as an asymptomatic enlarging pulmonary nodule. A case of Mycobacterium fortuitum presenting as an asymptomatic enlarging pulmonary nodule is described. This case is unusual because the patient was female, did not have underlying pulmonary disease, was not immunocompromised, had no evidence of dissemination, and had no history of aspiration or diabetes mellitus. The patient underwent thoractomy for resection of the pulmonary nodule, which led to the diagnosis. She recovered fully and is doing well without chemotherapy. \nInverted papillomas and associated squamous cell carcinomas. Inverted papillomas of the nose and paranasal sinuses are found to be associated with squamous cell carcinomas in a small percentage of cases. The records of forty-six patients treated for inverted papillomas in these areas over a 10-year period were reviewed. Eleven patients (24%) were found to have squamous cell carcinoma, and one carcinoma in situ, in relationship to the inverted papillomas. This is a much higher percentage than generally reported. Four of these patients were found to have inverted papillomas coincidentally in surgical specimens resected for squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma were found to be in older age groups, were more likely to manifest epistaxis than the more common unilateral nasal obstructive symptoms, and had less time between the onset of symptoms and presentation than those with inverted papillomas alone. The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of inverted papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas in association with inverted papillomas are discussed. \nComputed tomographic scan confirmation of paraprosthetic enteric fistula. Aortoenteric anastomotic fistulae and paraprosthetic graft infections are rare but devastating complications following aortic graft surgery. Although the incidence of these complications is reported to be less than 2%, the difficulty in diagnosis and management has led to high mortality rates and extensive morbidity. The majority of patients present with either groin infection or significant gastrointestinal tract bleeding. There is, however, a subset of patients with nonspecific clinical findings in whom routine studies are not diagnostic. Computed tomography was a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of retroperitoneal infection in these patients by demonstrating small collections of periaortic gas or \"black dots.\" The presence of periaortic gas in each instance proved to be a specific sign of a paraprosthetic-enteric fistula, as opposed to a graft infection without intestinal communication. \nInfluence of hepatitis B virus infection and age on mode of growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. According to the extent of hepatic involvement of the tumor and that of portal vein invasion at the time of initial diagnosis, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were grouped into three or four groups. Correlations among the extent of hepatic involvement, extent of portal vein invasion, and prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and age distribution were examined. The extent of hepatic involvement of the tumor and that of portal vein invasion were significantly greater in patients with positive HBsAg compared with findings in the negative patients (P less than 0.001). For cases of both positive and negative HBsAg, patients with a more extensive HCC were significantly younger. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hepatitis B antigenemia and younger age were statistically significant and independent positive predictors of extensive HCC. These results strongly suggest that hepatitis B surface antigenemia and age play an important role in the growth mode and the kinetics of HCC in Japanese patients. \nHydroureteronephrosis secondary to perforated Meckel's diverticulum. Complications related to Meckel's diverticulum are not unusual. However, involvement of the urinary tract is extremely rare. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of ureteral obstruction due to perforation of Meckel's diverticulum. \nNeutropenia-wise and pound-foolish: safe and effective chemotherapy in massively obese patients. The massively obese patients had an increased risk of cancer and complications from therapy. Chemotherapy in massively obese patients may be complicated by difficulty in calculating body surface area. No guidelines exist for calculating doses by either actual or ideal weight, and the calculated doses may vary by as much as 25%. The pharmacokinetics of antineoplastic drugs in obese patients are poorly understood and are not sufficient to create standards for rational dosing. We propose that patients being treated with curative intent receive full-dose intensity, using body surface area calculated on actual body weight or on ideal body weight with dose escalations if tolerated. Patients who are treated for short-term palliation may be more safely given doses based on ideal body weight. \nReperitonealization of the lesser curve in proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulcer. Ninety-six consecutive patients were operated upon with proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulcer at our department during the two year period 1976 to 1978. These patients were prospectively randomized into two groups, one of which (45 patients) had reperitonealization of the lesser curve. These two groups are compared herein. Reperitonealization of the lesser curve was without benefit on long term clinical results, ulcer recurrence rate and gastric acid secretion. None of the patients had perforation of the lesser curve. \nEndoscopic ultrasound in pancreatic tumor diagnosis. In a prospective study from 1988 to 1990, 132 patients with suspected pancreatic tumor were examined with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), transabdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and ERCP. The final diagnosis of 102 pancreatic tumors of different origin (76 malignant and 26 inflammatory tumors) and the exclusion of a pancreatic tumor in 30 patients was made by operation (N = 47), puncture (N = 36), autopsy (N = 3), or follow-up of a mean of 51 weeks (N = 46). Sensitivity and specificity in pancreatic tumor diagnosis were significantly higher for EUS (99% and 100%) than for US (67%/40%) and CT (77%/53%) and equal to ERCP (sensitivity 90%). This was even more obvious in small pancreatic tumors of 3 cm and less. However, as with the other imaging procedures, EUS was not able to differentiate reliably malignant from inflammatory pancreatic masses (accuracy 76% for malignancy and 46% for focal inflammation). From analysis of the endosonographic pattern of pancreatic tumors, no consistent morphologic features were identified which could have been specifically attributed to malignant or inflammatory masses. Our results show that EUS is superior to US and CT and equal to ERCP in pancreatic tumor diagnosis. In contrast to the indirect evidence obtained by ERCP, EUS provides direct visualization of tumor size and shape in almost all patients examined. Thus, EUS should be considered early in the evaluation of patients with suspected pancreatic tumors. \nSerum lactate dehydrogenase-3 isoenzyme in chronic granulocytic leukemia. Abnormal levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase-3 (LD-3) activity were observed in 92% of patients (35 of 38) with active chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), in 40% of patients (4 of 10) in partial remission, and in 13% of patients (1 of 8) in complete remission. In evaluating the electrophoretic LD isoenzyme patterns of these patients, three criteria were used. In criterion-1 elevations, the LD-3/total LD ratio, expressed as a fraction of serum total LD, and LD-3 value, expressed in absolute units, were greater than the upper limit of the reference range. In criterion-2 elevations, only the LD-3/total LD ratio was greater than the upper limit of the reference range. In criterion-3 elevations, only the absolute LD-3 activity exceeded the upper limit of the reference range, and these specimens showed isomorphic elevation of all five LD isoenzymes. Use of the last of these criteria increased the clinical sensitivity of serum LD-3 elevations in active CGL from 82% to 92%. The mean serum LD-3 absolute value and serum total LD activity usually showed statistically significant differences (P less than 0.05) among patients with active CGL, those in partial remission, and those in complete remission, but did not distinguish between subgroups of individuals with active CGL. Elevation of the serum LD-5/total LD ratio in 16 of 58 patients was due to hepatic injury or methodologic imprecision, showing analytically insignificant, borderline abnormalities in all cases of active CGL. In 10 of 62 patients in complete remission or partial remission, however, such elevation was unexplained. Our results indicate that the evaluation of serum LD-3 values in both absolute and relative terms slightly increases the clinical sensitivity of LD-3, and, therefore, suggest that LD-3 might be a useful marker for CGL. \nRapid orocecal transit in chronically active persons with high energy intake. Although chronic physical activity by humans can raise energy requirements and energy intake severalfold above sedentary levels, whether these increases alter digestive strategy remains unknown. To investigate this possibility, food passage rate (mouth-to-large intestinal lactulose transit) and absorption (xylose) were compared in a cross section of young men chosen to represent a wide range of daily physical activity and food intake. In 20 men (energy intake 1,272-5,342 kcal/day), resting mouth-to-cecum transit was faster in high caloric consumers (r = -0.69, P less than 0.01). In contrast, xylose absorption (n = 26; measured either as urinary xylose excretion or integrated breath H2 production from the sugar) was unrelated to food intake. Dietary fiber intake was uncorrelated with energy intake. This apparent human digestive strategy of rapid transit across the gut absorptive surface, without a sacrifice in absorption, parallels the adaptations made by several animal species similarly faced with increased energy demand at constant fiber intake. We therefore conclude that the hyperphagia of chronic exercise in humans may be linked with significant gastrointestinal adaptations. \nLocal eradication of rat colon cancer with photodynamic therapy: correlation of distribution of photosensitiser with biological effects in normal and tumour tissue. Photodynamic therapy is a photochemical technique for the local destruction of tumours, entailing the interaction of light with an administered photosensitiser to produce a cytotoxic effect. We investigated the tissue distribution of the photosensitiser aluminium sulphonated phthalocyanine (AlSPc) in dimethylhydrazine induced colonic tumours and adjacent normal colon in rats. Forty eight hours after intravenous injection, most tumours contained twice as much AlSPc as normal colon. Tumour size and position in the colon did not affect AlSPc concentration. Microscopic fluorescence localisation of AlSPc showed significant photosensitiser accumulation in tumour stroma, whereas tumour and normal mucosa contained similar amounts. Thus, some normal tissue damage, where malignant cells invade normal areas, would inevitably accompany eradication of tumours. Tumour destruction and healing of colon after tumour eradication were examined histologically. There was sharp demarcation between necrotic areas (tumour or normal) and adjacent tissue and, whether the treated area was tumour or normal, healing occurred by regeneration of normal tissue. Some incompletely eradicated large tumours showed evidence of delayed bleeding. The possibility of selective uptake or preferential retention of the photosensitiser in tumours formed the initial basis for investigation of photodynamic therapy, but it is now clear that this is seldom the most important factor for tumour eradication. Of far greater importance is the nature of the biological effect of photodynamic therapy as necrosis of small tumours involving the full thickness of the bowel wall can be achieved with safe healing by regeneration of normal colon. The maximum depth of necrosis produced was only a few millimetres, so this technique is unlikely to be of value as the primary treatment for large colonic tumours but may prove of value for eradicating small lesions or as adjunctive therapy for eradication of small nests of tumour remaining or recurring in the tumour bed after conventional surgery. \nUnruptured intracranial aneurysms: seizures and antiepileptic drug treatment following surgery. Twenty-one patients operated on for unruptured intracranial aneurysms were studied retrospectively in order to identify the incidence of postoperative seizures, factors predictive of seizures, and the response to discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs. The overall risk of postoperative seizures in initially seizure-free patients was 15.7%. Although seizures were not uncommon, antiepileptic drugs were successfully tapered in most of the patients before 12 months. \nCorrelation of the amnestic effects of nicotinic antagonists with inhibition of regional brain acetylcholine synthesis in rats. Acetylcholine (ACh) is considered to play a primary role in normal mnemonic functioning. Although most research has centered on the central muscarinic cholinergic system, of recent interest in normal and pathologic cognitive processing is the role of the nicotinic cholinergic system. The purpose of this research was to further characterize the role of the nicotinic system in learning and memory processing in a classical passive avoidance task by rats. The centrally acting nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine produced a dose-dependent impairment of performance in the passive avoidance task, however, the peripherally acting nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium was ineffective in this test. To elucidate the potential neurochemical mechanisms underlying mecamylamine's amnestic effect, we examined the ability of the drug to alter specific dynamic components of rat brain cholinergic systems in five brain regions. Mecamylamine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the synthesis of [3H]ACh from pulse-injected [3H]choline in all regions examined, but was without effect on endogenous, steady-state levels of ACh. As with the behavioral study, administration of hexamethonium was without effect on [3H]ACh synthesis. Calculation of the turnover rates of ACh allowed a correlation between the inhibition of the behavioral task and the inhibition of central cholinergic function. The high degree of correlation obtained (as well as earlier studies in nonhuman primates) underlined the possibility that presynaptically located nicotinic receptors on brain cholinergic neurons are tonically active and mediate a positive feedback mechanism for controlling cholinergic neuronal activity. These receptors may be the neurochemical substrate which underlie the behavioral changes after administration of nicotinic agonists and antagonists. \nCervical bruits: clinical correlates of stenosis. To analyze the relationship among characteristics of buits, degree of underlying stenosis, and neurologic symptom complexes, the authors studied 157 patients with bruits undergoing digital subtraction angiography. Symptom status assignment (definite lateralizing, possible lateralizing, vertebrobasilar, diffuse, and asymptomatic) and cervical auscultation for location, duration, and other bruit characteristics were performed independently. Bruit occurrence was associated with stenosis of greater than or equal to 50% of the underlying vessel with the association being no stronger at higher levels of stenosis (greater than or equal to 80%). No relationship existed between the side of bruit and side of symptoms in those with lateralized symptoms. The authors found more severe degrees of carotid stenosis in two symptomatic groups (vertebrobasilar insufficiency [VBI] and definite lateralized) compared with asymptomatic patients. Those with VBI had more high-grade stenosis, whereas those with lateralized symptoms had more occlusions, which tended to be ipsilateral to the symptoms. \nPresynaptic regulation of cardiac sympathetic function in hypoxic guinea pigs. In the normal heart, presynaptic cholinergic muscarinic and alpha 2-adrenergic mechanisms modify the fractional rate constant for norepinephrine (NE) synthesis (kNE), an index of sympathetic neural function. To evaluate presynaptic regulation of kNE, conscious guinea pigs subjected to normoxia and then hypoxia (n = 7-8 in each group) were pretreated with 1) vehicle; 2) a cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, methyl atropine; 3) an alpha 2-antagonist, yohimbine; or 4) a combination of the two. An increase of kNE was determined from incorporation of radiolabeled tyrosine into NE in a control period (arterial PO2 130 +/- 1.7 Torr, PCO2 36 +/- 0.5 Torr) and during a hypoxic state (PO2 49.6 +/- 1.0 Torr, PCO2 36 +/- 0.5 Torr). Hypoxia activated kNE in the atrioventricular node and right ventricular moderator band in vehicle-treated animals (P less than 0.05). Sympathetic activation was more general, however, because alpha 2-presynaptic influence acted to limit kNE in all tissues tested (P less than 0.05) except muscle, spleen, and posterior left ventricle. Cholinergic muscarinic presynaptic restraint on kNE was detected during hypoxia only in the left atrial appendage and lung (P less than 0.05). These data indicate that hypoxia increases kNE in the heart, but restraint by cholinergic muscarinic and alpha 2-adrenergic presynaptic mechanisms limits increases in neurotransmitter synthesis and noradrenergic activation regionally. \nLingual thyroid: the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging. Lingual thyroid is an uncommon developmental aberration of embryogenesis. It may present as a mid-line, non-tender, painless, reddish appearing swelling in the throat. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a relatively new diagnostic method for this condition. Two cases of lingual thyroid are reviewed with their MRI's and surgical results. \nLocal application of somatostatin in the rat ventrolateral brain medulla induces apnea. Local injections of the tetradecapeptide somatostatin (SOM) into the brain stem region were performed in anesthetized and decerebrate rats. SOM administration (0.6-1.8 nmol) into the nucleus paragigantocellularis and the nucleus reticularis lateralis of the ventrolateral medulla oblongata induced ventilatory depression and apnea. The occurrence of apnea was dose dependent and attributed to the anesthetic depth, and it was seen within 60-240 s after injection. In anesthetized rats the apnea was seen as a termination or a continuous decrease in tidal volume while respiratory frequency remained unaltered. SOM-induced apnea was caused by depression of central inspiratory drive. SOM injections into the dorsal medulla were ineffective in eliciting apnea, although a ventilatory depression but no apnea was induced in the awake unanesthetized state. In addition to its effect on basal ventilation, SOM administration in the ventrolateral medulla resulted in a blunted ventilatory response to hypoxic and hypercapnic stimuli in anesthetized rats. We conclude that SOM has potent inhibitory effects on respiration that are specifically located in the nucleus paragigantocellularis and the nucleus reticularis lateralis. \nWrist movements in able-bodied and brain injured individuals. The purpose of this study was to compare movement velocity characteristics during targeted wrist movements between able-bodied individuals and a sample of individuals with spasticity secondary to closed head injury. Two amplitudes (30 degrees and 60 degrees) of movement were performed at slow and fast velocities, with the forearm either passively supported or actively supported by elbow extension and shoulder flexion. Variables measured were the following: (1) average velocity of entire movement, (2) velocity for 10 degrees increments of a movement, and (3) ratio of average peak 10 degrees increment velocity to average velocity. In addition, qualitative examination of velocity profiles was performed. Slow movements were performed in a discontinuous manner by both groups; however, observable differences in peak/average velocity were noted between groups in the unsupported position during slow and fast movements. Able-bodied individuals performed seven of eight fast movements with greater velocity (p less than .05) than brain injured individuals, and the fast movements of the able-bodied subjects were continuous. \nAdenocarcinoma of the pancreas: current management of resectable and locally advanced disease. Surgical resection alone for patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas has rarely resulted in cure, and long-term survival is uncommon. The magnitude of the operation has historically prevented many patients from receiving multimodality therapy with systemic chemotherapy or radiation (external beam and intraoperative). Improved rates of operative morbidity and mortality, technical advances in intraoperative radiotherapy, and encouraging results from studies combining radiation and chemotherapy have renewed interest in innovative treatments for this disease. We review the rationale for the current management of patients with resectable and locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and the current trial at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. \nHypertonic nasogastric tube feedings: do they cause diarrhea? Hypertonic NG tube feeding in hospitalized patients, whether on the hospital ward or in the ICU, is considered a common etiology of diarrhea. To evaluate the accuracy of this assumption, five normal volunteers, ten hospitalized postoperative patients with head and neck cancer, and 24 ICU patients were given hypertonic (690 mosm), low residue, lactose-free tube feedings starting at 30 kcal/kg.day. There was no prior history of diarrhea in any of the groups studied. There was a significant difference in albumin levels between the three groups, with an average albumin of 2.8 g/dl in the ICU patient group; different from 4.5 g/dl present in both the normal volunteer and non-ICU hospitalized patient groups (general linear models procedure from SAS, p less than .05) (Duncan test). Diarrhea was not present in the normal volunteers or non-ICU patients during the feedings, but did occur in 3/24 ICU patients. This difference was not significant. The three patients with diarrhea had an average albumin level of 3.0 g/dl, while the other ICU patients had an average albumin of 2.7 g/dl. We conclude that hypertonic NG tube feedings do not cause diarrhea in normal volunteers or postoperative head and neck cancer patients. However, in a small statistically insignificant percent of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, this regimen may cause diarrhea although no risk factors can be identified. \nAcute necrotizing pancreatitis: management by planned, staged pancreatic necrosectomy/debridement and delayed primary wound closure over drains. We reviewed our recent experience with management of 23 consecutive patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. All patients had documented necrotizing pancreatitis with parenchymal or peripancreatic necrosis. Our method of treatment has evolved from our previous approach of controlled open lesser sac drainage (marsupialization) to staged necrosectomy/debridement with delayed primary closure over drains. With this latter approach, hospital mortality was 4 of 23 patients (17 per cent), but significant morbidity still occurred in 12 of 23 patients (52 per cent). However, recurrent intra-abdominal abscess before discharge occurred in only one patient. We believe that this operative approach toward the severely ill patient with acute necrotizing pancreatitis who requires operative intervention will minimize the occurrence of intra-abdominal sepsis. \nPrimary rhabdomyosarcoma of the iris. We describe herein a 4-year-old girl with primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the right iris. Malignant cells were aspirated from the aqueous humor, and the eye was enucleated 7 months after the tumor appeared. To our knowledge, only two cases of primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the iris have been reported. Both of these patients received radiation therapy prior to enucleation. \nDietary effects on breast-cancer risk in Singapore. It is suspected that diet influences the risk of getting breast cancer. A study of diet and breast cancer was done among 200 Singapore Chinese women with histologically confirmed disease and 420 matched controls. A quantitative food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess intakes of selected nutrients and foods 1 year before interview. Daily intakes were computed and risk analysed after adjustment for concomitant risk factors. In premenopausal women, high intakes of animal proteins and red meat were associated with increased risk. Decreased risk was associated with high intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), beta-carotene, soya proteins, total soya products, a high PUFA to saturated fatty acid ratio, and a high proportion of soya to total protein. In multiple analysis, the variables which were significant after adjustment for each other were red meat (p less than 0.001) as a predisposing factor, and PUFA (p = 0.02), beta-carotene (p = 0.003), and soya protein (p = 0.02) as protective factors. The analysis of dietary variables in postmenopausal women gave uniformly non-significant results. Our finding that soya products may protect against breast cancer in younger women is of interest since these foods are rich in phyto-oestrogens. \nComparison of indium-111 antimyosin antibody and technetium-99m pyrophosphate localization in reperfused and nonreperfused myocardial infarction Recent imaging studies suggest that technetium-99m (Tc-99m) pyrophosphate yields a considerably larger estimate of myocardial infarct size than does indium-111 (In-111) monoclonal antimyosin antibody. To determine whether Tc-99m pyrophosphate may be taken up by reversibly injured myocytes, particularly in the setting of coronary reperfusion, the tissue localization of Tc-99m pyrophosphate and antimyosin antibody was compared in 11 dogs 24 to 68 h after anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (4 dogs with permanent occlusion, 7 with reperfusion). Technetium-99m pyrophosphate and In-111 antimyosin antibody content was determined in serial 2 to 3 mm wide endocardial and epicardial samples taken through the infarct zone in multiple short-axis left ventricular slices. The number of samples with increased In-111 antimyosin antibody (defined as greater than or equal to mean + 2 SD of normal) was not significantly different from that with increased Tc-99m pyrophosphate. This was true in both reperfused and nonreperfused infarcts. However, the intensity of uptake of Tc-99m pyrophosphate exceeded that of In-111 antimyosin antibody, particularly in the border zones of reperfused infarcts, and the area with moderate to marked increase in tracer uptake (greater than or equal to 2 times normal) was significantly larger with Tc-99m pyrophosphate than In-111 antimyosin antibody (p less than 0.001). A specific zone of abnormal Tc-99m pyrophosphate with normal In-111 antimyosin antibody content could not be identified. Histologic evidence of myocardial necrosis was found in virtually every sample with increased In-111 antimyosin antibody, Tc-99m pyrophosphate, or both. \nComparison of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone in acute myocardial infarction. Urochinasi per via Sistemica nell'Infarto Miocardico (USIM) Collaborative Group. In a randomized trial of the effects on in-hospital mortality of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone, 2,531 patients with acute myocardial infarction in 89 coronary care units were enrolled for greater than 30 months. Patients admitted within 4 hours of the onset of pain were randomized to receive either intravenous urokinase (a bolus dose of 1 million U repeated after 60 minutes) plus heparin (a bolus dose of 10,000 U followed by 1,000 IU/hour for 48 hours) or heparin alone (infused at the same rate). Complete data were obtained in 2,201 patients (1,128 taking urokinase and 1,073 taking heparin). At 16 days, overall hospital mortality was 8% in the urokinase and 8.3% in the heparin group (p = not significant). Among patients with anterior infarction, mortality was 10.3% in the urokinase and 13.9% in the heparin group (p = 0.09; relative risk = 0.73). The incidence of major bleeding (urokinase 0.44%, heparin 0.37%) as well as the overall incidence of stroke (urokinase 0.35%, heparin 0.20%) was similar in the 2 groups. The rates of major in-hospital cardiac complications (reinfarction, postinfarction angina) were also similar. \nEffects of antiplatelet agents alone or in combinations on platelet aggregation and on liver metastases from a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the nude mouse. There is ample evidence to suggest that hematogenous metastasis may be related to the ability of tumor cells to promote aggregation of host platelets. Arachidonic acid metabolism in platelets and vessel walls may also contribute to the metastatic process. Several preliminary trials of platelet inhibitory agents have been performed. Ketoconazole (inhibitor of lipoxygenase and thromboxane synthetase), verapamil (calcium antagonist), forskolin (stimulator of platelet adenylate cyclase), and indomethacin (inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) were examined, alone and in combination, to investigate their effects on platelet aggregation and on hepatic metastases from human pancreatic tumor cells (RWP-2) in nude mice. The tumor cells were injected intrasplenically, and the animals were divided into control, single-drug and combination treatment groups. The agents were administered intraperitoneally 1 hr before and every 24 hr after the tumor cell injections for 6 days. Statistically significant differences were observed between the control and single-treatment groups on the reduction of liver tumor nodules (range P less than 0.001-0.032) and in the liver surface areas occupied by tumor (range P less than 0.001-0.013). Furthermore, when these agents were combined, similar reductions in liver tumor nodules were noted (range P less than 0.001-0.008), while even greater inhibitory effects were seen in the liver surface areas occupied by tumor (P less than 0.001) compared with the single-treatment groups. Also, the combination studies strongly inhibited RWP-2-induced platelet aggregation in human platelet-rich plasma. \nNatural history of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis associated with aortic disease. The natural history of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis has not been well defined, particularly when discovered in conjunction with aortic disease requiring correction. To better define the natural history of such lesions, 194 sequential aortograms in 48 patients were studied to define predictive criteria for stenoses at risk for progression. Sixty-six unsuspected atherosclerotic renal arterial stenoses were identified on the initial aortograms. Disease progressed in 42 arteries (53%), 14 bilateral and 28 unilateral. Seven arteries developed occlusion. All had stenoses averaging 80% (range 61% to 94%) noted on the most recent aortogram preceding occlusion. Risk factors including smoking, diabetes mellitus, elevated serum lipids, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, or change in blood pressure or creatinine, did not correlate with degree or rate of progression of the renal artery stenosis. A difference in kidney size, although varying inversely with degree of stenosis, was not a statistically significant marker of disease progression. This analysis suggests that identification of renal arterial stenoses that will progress is best determined by sequential aortography. Highly stenotic vessels are more prone to occlude than those less stenotic. Consequently, individuals with preocclusive lesions should benefit from prophylactic renal revascularization during aortic reconstruction. \nLong-term results of keratoepithelioplasty in Mooren's ulcer. A consecutive series of 20 eyes with Mooren's ulcer was treated by a new surgical approach: keratoepithelioplasty alone or in combination with corneoscleral lamellar graft. Eighteen (90%) eyes showed complete remission promptly after surgery; the other two also healed with the administration of additional systemic and topical steroids. During the follow-up periods (mean, 3.1 years), minor recurrence was found in 5 (25%) eyes for the first 6 months, in none (0%) for the second 6 months, in 2 (12%) for the third 6 months, and none thereafter. All seven eyes with recurrence were cured by additional steroid treatment, alone or with conjunctival excision and/or keratoepithelioplasty. In the 18 (90%) eyes, the lenticules, constantly observed, remained silent on the scleras, which were free from conjunctival invasion. These results strongly support the authors' theory that keratoepithelioplasty using donor corneal lenticules can heal Mooren's ulcer via blockage of infiltrated conjunctival invasion. \nSurgical manipulation of primate cerebral arteries in established vasospasm. It is generally believed that surgery in the face of angiographic vasospasm is dangerous due to an increased incidence of postoperative cerebral ischemia. One theory is that arterial narrowing is exacerbated by surgical manipulation of vasospastic vessels during aneurysm dissection and clipping. This theory was tested in a primate model of cerebral vasospasm and the results reported. Six monkeys underwent baseline cerebral angiography, followed by induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on both sides of the circle of Willis. An equal amount of fresh autologous blood clot was placed around each internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral artery. Six days later, angiography was repeated and the right craniectomy was reopened for clot evacuation and surgical manipulation of the right cerebral arteries, including placement of a temporary aneurysm clip on the right middle cerebral artery. The left cerebral arteries were not exposed or manipulated, and served as controls. Twenty-four hours later angiography was repeated, then the animals were killed. Equal and significant vasospasm (greater than 40% reduction in vessel caliber compared to baseline, p less than 0.05) was seen in the middle cerebral arteries on both sides of the circle of Willis in all animals 6 and 7 days after SAH. There was no significant change in the severity of vasospasm on Day 7 compared with Day 6 in the right cerebral arteries. Increased risk of postoperative cerebral ischemia for surgery in the peak vasospasm period may be due to mechanisms other than increased arterial narrowing precipitated by surgical manipulation. \nRecurrent spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrhage from peliosis hepatis. Peliosis hepatis is a rare and highly lethal liver lesion in which numerous blood-filled cavities or cystic spaces are dispersed throughout the hepatic parenchyma. The cause is unknown, although the condition is associated with several disease states and medications. Patients may present with hemorrhage, liver failure, the hepatorenal syndrome, cholestasis, or portal hypertension. We treated a patient who survived two separate hemorrhages from peliosis hepatis. The surgical intervention used, hepatic dearterialization, has allowed this patient to remain asymptomatic for 5 years. \nThe influence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection on the development of the hepatitis B virus carrier state. To assess the influence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on the natural history of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, a study was undertaken of the clinical records of all 77 homosexual men with documented seroconversion to anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) between visits to either of two Sydney clinics between 1985 and 1989. HIV-1-seropositive subjects developed chronic HBV infection (positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] greater than 6 months) more frequently (7/31, 23%) than HIV-1-seronegative ones (2/46, 4%; P = .026). HIV-positive subjects who cleared HBsAg had significantly more circulating CD4+ lymphocytes (mean, 547 x 10(6)/l) than those who did not (352 x 10(6)/l, P less than .005). A subset of subjects who acquired both viruses between visits had an even higher rate of chronic infection (4/10, 40%). Icteric illnesses were reported more frequently by HIV-1-seronegative (11/46, 24%) than -seropositive subjects (3/31, 10%; P = .20). These findings indicate a potential for an increased reservoir of HBV infection in the community as a consequence of the HIV-1 epidemic. \nDetection of intracoronary fibrin degradation after coronary balloon angioplasty. Intracoronary thrombus formation may be involved in the pathogenesis of arterial closure after coronary angioplasty and may contribute to restenosis. It is hypothesized that, unlike markers of platelet activation and fibrin formation, D-dimer, a product of plasmin-mediated proteolysis of cross-linked fibrin, is not subject to significant catheter-induced artifact and could be used to study intracoronary fibrin degradation during angioplasty. No significant difference in D-dimer levels was noted in serial plasma samples obtained from an 8Fr arterial sheath and the wire lumen of an angioplasty balloon catheter, indicating that sampling through the catheter lumen did not induce artifactual D-dimer elevations. Translesion (proximal and distal to the lesion) coronary blood samples were collected in 31 patients undergoing elective coronary angioplasty pretreated with aspirin, dipyridamole and heparin. In 20 of those in whom translesion coronary samples for plasma D-dimer levels (mean +/- standard deviation) were collected before balloon dilation, there was no evidence of ongoing intracoronary fibrinolysis (proximal D-dimer levels, 289 +/- 145 ng/ml; distal, 299 +/- 156 ng/ml; difference not significant). After coronary angioplasty (n = 31), there was a relatively small, but significant (p less than 0.001) increase (45 +/- 71 ng/ml) in translesional D-dimer levels (proximal, 396 +/- 223 ng/ml; distal, 441 +/- 257 ng/ml). The results from this study suggest (1) D-dimer levels are not subject to significant catheter-induced artifact and may be useful for assessment of intracoronary fibrin metabolism, and (2) intracoronary degradation of fibrin can be detected after (but not before) routine coronary angioplasty despite pretreatment with antithrombotic therapy, presumably in response to balloon-induced arterial injury and fibrin formation. \nChronic urticaria and cancer: an epidemiological study of 1155 patients. To evaluate the possible association of malignant disease with chronic urticaria 1155 consecutive cases with chronic urticaria were reviewed. The Swedish Cancer Registry, Stockholm, was searched for records reporting malignancies in the study population (1958-84), and the expected number of malignancies was calculated on the basis of age- and sex-standardized incidence data. A malignancy was diagnosed in 36 patients with urticaria and the expected number of malignancies was 41. In 23 patients the malignancy appeared during the same year as the onset of urticaria or later. The expected number was 25.6. We conclude that chronic urticaria is not statistically associated with malignancy in general. \nThe effects of dorsal column stimulation on measures of clinical and experimental pain in man. Despite the extensive use of dorsal column stimulation (DCS) for the control of various chronic pain conditions, most clinicians report only modest success rates. Surprisingly, there has been little placebo-controlled investigation of its efficacy for altering either clinical or experimental pain perception. The current study compared the effects of DCS to placebo stimulation on clinical pain perception, perceived intensity of painful heat stimuli and visual stimuli, and the discrimination of small changes in noxious heat intensity and in light intensity. We found that DCS, but not placebo stimulation, significantly altered ratings of spontaneous clinical pain as well as those of painful cutaneous heat. In addition, heat discrimination thresholds were increased by DCS, but not placebo. On the other hand, DCS had no effect on ratings of visual stimulus intensity nor on visual discrimination, suggesting that the DCS modulation of pain perception was not due to a general change in attention. These data indicate that DCS significantly alters pain transmission in humans. Nevertheless, the relatively small reduction in clinical pain (less than 30%) must be weighed against the invasive nature of electrode implantation. \nMolecular basis of sequestration in severe and uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria: differential adhesion of infected erythrocytes to CD36 and ICAM-1. The CD36 and ICAM-1 glycoproteins on vascular endothelial cells have been implicated as cytoadherence receptors for Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IRBC). Adhesion of IRBC from Thai patients with uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria to purified CD36 or ICAM-1 and to C32 melanoma cells was compared. All malaria isolates bound to solid phase-adsorbed CD36 and to fluid-phase 125I-labeled CD36. IRBC adhesion to purified ICAM-1 varied widely, and no correlation with clinical severity of disease was observed. The cytoadherent phenotype of IRBC was modulated by selective panning on plates coated with purified CD36 or ICAM-1. IRBC selected by panning on CD36+, ICAM-1+ melanoma cells bound to cells that express surface CD36 but not to CD36-deficient cells, indicating that CD36 exerts a strong selective pressure on the IRBC cytoadherent phenotype. IRBC adhesion to CD36 and ICAM-1 suggests that P. falciparum parasites may use these receptors in vivo to promote parasite survival and immune evasion. \nCystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum. A report of three cases. Three cases of peritoneal cystic mesothelioma are reported. All patients were women who had undergone previous abdominal surgery for unrelated conditions. Tumors consisted of solitary and multiple cystic masses involving the abdominal and pelvic peritoneum. The cysts focally infiltrated the muscularis externa of the small intestine in case 1, the outer muscular layer of the uterus in case 2, and the omental tissue in case 3. These findings give morphologic support to the borderline clinical behavior of this tumor that often recurs and support the hypothesis that previous surgery may play a role in its pathogenesis. \nChronic diarrhea. A practical approach for the pediatrician. Despite the high prevalence of chronic diarrhea there is no universal approach to its diagnosis and treatment. This article summarizes the pathophysiologic processes that result in chronic diarrhea and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this often distressing problem. \nCardiopulmonary arrest following an infusion of calcium 2-amino ethanol phosphate. The intravenous infusion of calcium 2-amino ethanol phosphate was coincidental with cardiopulmonary arrest in a 53-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis. Resuscitation was followed by massive hemolysis, renal failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, shock liver, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. This agent, in use by at least one practitioner in West Germany for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders is not FDA approved for use in the United States, nor is clinical investigation underway. It is currently thought to be in use by about 200 practitioners throughout this country as treatment for multiple sclerosis. It is apparently obtained in West Germany and brought illegally into the United States. This is the first known report of an adverse drug reaction associated with the use of this product. \nDetermination of erythrocyte-bound acetylcholinesterase activity for monitoring pyridostigmine therapy in myasthenia gravis. Monitoring of pyridostigmine therapy in patients with myasthenia gravis is not routinely performed, since the daily pyridostigmine doses are adjusted to the patient's actual clinical status rather than to pyridostigmine plasma concentrations (PPC). Moreover, PPC determination is time-consuming and needs much technical equipment. Since pyridostigmine reversible blocks acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at the neuromuscular junction, we studied the correlation between the enzyme's blood activity (erythrocyte-bound AChE) and PPC, on the one hand, and between blood AChE activity and the clinical status of the individual patient, on the other. In five previously untreated patients with myasthenia gravis blood AChE activity decreased in accordance with the actual PPC after a single oral dose of 60 mg pyridostigmine (group A). Amelioration of the clinical status corresponded to the decrease of AChE activity in the same way. In another five patients, who were on stable pyridostigmine medication for at least 1 week, AChE activity and PPC were constant during the day (group B). Since it is easier to perform than PPC, our results suggest that the determination of AChE activity may be superior to measuring PPC for monitoring cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in selected cases. \nStriatopallidonigral degeneration in Pick's disease: a clinicopathological study of 41 cases. The frequency and degree of stiatopallidonigral (SPN) degeneration were examined in 41 autopsy cases of Pick's disease. Based on the degree of SPN degeneration, these cases were arranged into four groups: 1) group I (severely degenerate; 19.5%), 2) group II (moderately degenerate; 22.0%), 3) group III (mildly degenerate; 36.5%), and 4) group IV (non-degenerate; 22.0%). 17 of the 41 cases had a definite (moderate to severe) SPN degeneration. The striatum, especially the caudate nucleus, was most frequently and most severely affected, while the internal segment of the globus pallidus was least frequently and least severely affected. In general, the oral portions of the SPN nuclei were more severely involved. In addition, in the putamen and globus pallidus the dorsomedial portions adjacent to the internal capsule were apt to be affected more markedly than the other portions. In the substantia nigra the degeneration tended to be more predominant in the pars reticulata than in the pars compacta, although both were usually involved. In addition, the medial to central portions of the substantia nigra were more vulnerable. In comparing the severely and moderately degenerate groups (groups I and II) with the mildly and non degenerate groups (groups III and IV), the former had more female cases, longer duration of illness, and more third-stage cases. In addition, the former contained more cases with lower brain weight and (predominant) frontal atrophy type, and more atypical cases without Pick bodies, or with symmetrical pyramidal tract degeneration or with combined traumatic lesions. It is notable that in all cases with definite SPN degeneration no extrapyramidal involuntary movements had been detected. \nSeasonality of disease in Kuwait. To compare the seasonal variation in total mortality and deaths from cardiovascular, respiratory, and malignant disease, data were collected from North-East Scotland (Grampian region) and Kuwait. Seasonal differences were similar, in both timing and degree, for total mortality and deaths from circulatory disease, but were greater in Kuwait for respiratory disease. Peak mortality was during winter in both areas: in Grampian, when the climate is most uncomfortable, and in Kuwait, when the climate is at its most comfortable. Socioeconomic changes in Kuwait have been accompanied by a rapid fall in the degree of seasonality (deseasonality) for both total and infant mortality. These findings suggest that mortality peaks in winter, not because of a seasonally low temperature, but because of a seasonal fall in mean temperature irrespective of the annual mean temperature. \nLiterary neurologic syndromes. Alice in Wonderland. Many neurologic syndromes are named for literary characters. For example, the \"Alice in Wonderland\" syndrome of altered body perceptions, usually caused by migrainous ischemia, is so called because of the resemblance of its symptoms to the fluctuations in size and shape that plague the main character in Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice in Wonderland. The medical symptoms of distorted body images match the literary description so precisely that illustrations from the original book depict them very accurately. Because Lewis Carroll suffered from classic migraine headaches, scholars have speculated that he may have experienced this syndrome himself. \nSystemic adjuvant therapy in women with resected node-negative breast cancer. Currently, the role of adjuvant systemic therapy in women with node-negative breast cancer is being determined. Several studies of adjuvant hormonal therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy have demonstrated a moderate reduction in the risk of recurrence in the treated patients. With relatively limited follow-up, however, overall survival has not improved with use of adjuvant therapy. The use of prognostic factors to select those patients at highest risk for relapse is an active area of oncologic research. The decision to recommend adjuvant therapy necessitates assessment of the probability of recurrence, the expected reduction of risk with adjuvant therapy, the toxic effects of therapy, and the influence of treatment on the patient's overall quality of life. \nFalse-negative dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial imaging after caffeine infusion. The vasodilator effect of intravenously administered dipyridamole may be caused by an increase in endogenous plasma adenosine levels. We evaluated the effect of caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, on the diagnostic results of dipyridamole-201Tl myocardial imaging in eight patients with coronary artery disease. Caffeine infusion significantly attenuated the dipyridamole-induced fall in blood pressure and the accompanied increase in heart rate. The infusion of dipyridamole alone resulted in chest pain and ST-segment depressions on the electrocardiogram in four patients, whereas none of these problems occurred when the tests were repeated after caffeine. In six of eight patients, caffeine was responsible for false-negative dipyridamole-201Tl tests. Semiquantitive scores of the dipyridamole-induced 201Tl perfusion defects were decreased by caffeine from 9.0 +/- 0.9 to 2.0 +/- 1.1 points (p less than 0.05). Computerized analysis revealed a caffeine-mediated reduction in the percent reversibility of the images from 46% +/- 16% to 6% +/- 10% (p less than 0.05). We conclude that the use of caffeinated products prior to dipyridamole-201Tl testing may be responsible for false-negative findings. \nInvestigation of varicella-zoster virus infection by polymerase chain reaction in the immunocompetent host with acute varicella. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method developed to detect varicella zoster virus (VZV) in clinical samples is based on amplifying sequences of viral gene 31, the coding region for glycoprotein II. Its sensitivity was evaluated by amplification from plasmid VZV DNA containing VZV gene 31; 45 copies were detected in 1 microgram of human DNA. In testing within 24 h after the onset of varicella exanthem, 21 (75%) of 28 lesion samples were positive by VZV PCR, whereas VZV was isolated from only 21% by a standard tissue culture method. Only 1 (3.3%) of 30 samples of oropharyngeal secretions but peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 8 (67%) of 12 patients were positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the VZV PCR method indicates its usefulness for investigating the pathogenesis of VZV infection. Direct contact with cutaneous lesions rather than respiratory secretions may be the most important route of VZV transmission from healthy individuals with acute varicella. \nCarcinoma (malignant mixed mullerian [mesodermal] tumor) of the uterus and ovary. Correlation of clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical features in 29 cases. We examined the histologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical features of a series of 23 endometrial, five cervical, and one ovarian carcinosarcomas (malignant mixed mullerian [mesodermal] tumors) and nine associated distant peritoneal metastases. The primary tumors all showed epithelial differentiation (cytokeratin and/or epithelial membrane antigen expression) of the carcinomatous component, while sarcomatous areas showed epithelial differentiation in all but one case. The metastases showed uniform staining for cytokeratin (eight of eight cases) and epithelial membrane antigen (eight of eight cases), including the spindle cell component that was present in four of nine cases. Desmin significantly changed the interpretation of rhabdomyosarcoma differentiation by refuting putative rhabdomyoblasts in two cases and identifying rhabdomyoblasts in two other cases where they were unrecognized on hematoxylineosin staining. S100 protein was positive in all five cases with chondrosarcoma differentiation. Muscle-specific actin and vimentin were positive in the sarcomatous component of all cases and in the carcinomatous component of seven and 10 cases, respectively. After immunostaining, heterologous elements were present in 18 of 29 cases (11 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, three cases of chondrosarcoma, three cases of mixed rhabdomyosarcoma and chondrosarcoma, and one case of liposarcoma). Only six of 27 patients with follow-up were disease free for 12 months or longer (associated with stage I or II disease, smaller size, no lymphatic invasion in the resection specimen, and no invasion of the outer two thirds of myometrium). Presence and type of heterologous elements, grade of sarcomatous or carcinomatous components, histologic type of carcinomatous component, gross appearance, presence of necrosis, or use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy did not affect outcome. Carcinosarcomas are clinically aggressive distinctive mixed epithelial-stromal neoplasms with histologic and immunohistochemical features that overlap with metaplastic carcinoma in many cases. \nLack of association between neutropenia and the incidence of bacteremia associated with indwelling central venous catheters in febrile pediatric cancer patients. To assess the incidence of bacteremia in pediatric cancer patients with indwelling central venous catheters with fever, we reviewed the records of all 67 such patients sequentially admitted during a 10-month period at our institution. There were a total of 140 episodes of fever in these 67 patients. In 55 of the episodes (39%) patients were nonneutropenic (absolute neutrophil count, greater than 500/mm3); 85 episodes (61%) were associated with neutropenia. Twenty-four percent of all episodes of fever in nonneutropenic patients were related to bacteremia vs. 9.5% of episodes of fever in the presence of neutropenia (P less than 0.05). When clinical evidence of an exit site infection was absent, the incidence of bacteremia in the neutropenic and nonneutropenic groups was similar (11% in the neutropenic group; 10% in the nonneutropenic group). We conclude that bacteremia is frequently observed in febrile pediatric cancer patients with indwelling venous catheters who are not neutropenic, particularly if there is clinical evidence of an exit site infection. Thus empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted in all pediatric oncology patients with indwelling catheters who develop fever. \nHigh recovery of Haemophilus influenzae and group A streptococci in recurrent tonsillar infection or hypertrophy as compared with normal tonsils. One hundred and twenty-six patients who underwent tonsillectomy because of recurrent acute tonsillitis, tonsillar hypertrophy or sleep apnoea were evaluated by tonsillar core culturing. The sleep apnoea patients served as controls, since none of them had tonsillar hypertrophy at ENT examination or any history of recurrent acute tonsillitis, and thus their tonsillar core flora could be regarded as normal. The isolation rate of H. influenzae was much lower among sleep apnoea controls (2.7 per cent) than among either the patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis (20.3 per cent) or those with tonsillar hypertrophy (36.7 per cent) (p less than 0.05), as was that of group A streptococci, 5.4 per cent versus 16.9 and 20 per cent, respectively (though the latter differences were not statistically significant). The isolation frequencies of B. catarrhalis, pneumococci, group C and G streptococci did not differ between the three groups. The high tonsillar core recovery rates of H. influenzae and group A streptococci both in patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis and in those with tonsillar hypertrophy, as compared with normal controls, suggests the possible involvement of these bacteria in both conditions. \nAutoerotic death. A definition. A definition of autoerotic death is suggested that restricts the use of this term to accidental deaths that occur during individual, usually solitary, sexual activity in which a device, apparatus, or prop that was employed to enhance the sexual stimulation of the deceased in some way caused unintended death. The case of the autoerotic asphyxial death of a 48-year-old man is reported in order to demonstrate the application of this definition. \nA comparison of sucralfate with placebo in the treatment of esophageal ulcers following therapeutic endoscopic sclerotherapy of esophageal varices--a prospective controlled randomized trial. In 1984 Roark published the first report of a sucralfate treatment of esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy. Because this was an uncontrolled trial we planned a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study with 60 patients. After therapeutic paravariceal injection-sclerotherapy of esophageal varices, patients were randomly treated with sucralfate suspension or placebo. Time of treatment was limited to a maximum of 3 weeks and the dosage of sucralfate was 1 g q.i.d. (Ulcogant-Suspension). Healing was assessed by endoscopy at weekly intervals. Fifty-three patients (25 sucralfate, 28 placebo) were evaluable according to the protocol. No patient left the study because of side effects. At the start of the trial, the patients in the sucralfate group showed a larger ulcer area than the placebo group. There was a tendency to faster healing in the sucralfate group, especially in patients with deeper ulcerations. However, there was no significant difference in global healing between both treatment groups after 3 weeks. Sucralfate suspension may be of value in accelerating the healing process in esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy, especially in patients with deep ulcers. These results should be confirmed in further trials, in which patients should be stratified with respect to their ulcer volume and severity of liver disease. \nCholestasis in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome: comparison between ultrasonographic and cholangiographic findings. Cholestasis in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome was systematically investigated by ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The two procedures were found to be complementary, and showed similar results in 56.2% of the cases. Ultrasonography was superior in detecting common bile duct wall thickening, whereas endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was superior in demonstrating intrahepatic narrowing of the biliary tract. \nInaccuracy of pulse oximetry in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. The accuracy of pulse oximetry was studied in a group of patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. Measurements of arterial oxygen saturation from a finger and an ear probe were compared with those from a radial arterial blood sample analysed in vitro. Lower values were obtained using the pulse oximeter; the difference ranged from +2% to -11%. The discrepancies between pulse oximeter and laboratory oximeter readings were greater in this group of patients than in a control group who did not have tricuspid regurgitation. There was, however, no correlation between the magnitude of this discrepancy and either the peak central venous pressure or the venous pulse pressure. \nSubpopulations of B cells in germinal centers. III. HJ6, a monoclonal antibody, binds globoside and a subpopulation of germinal center B cells. To identify surface Ag uniquely expressed on human germinal center B cells, we produced a mouse mAb, HJ6. When tonsillar lymphocytes were examined, HJ6 did not label T cells and labeled only about half of PNA+ B cells that were HK23-. HJ6 did not label mononuclear cells from peripheral blood, splenocytes, and any of 29 cell lines including 23 B cell lines. This binding pattern of HJ6 was very similar to that of a mAb named 5B5. It was shown previously that 5B5 bound a glycolipid named CTH (CD77) and its Ag was expressed on HK23- PNA+ tonsillar lymphocytes and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Despite the similarity, HJ6 differed from 5B5: HJ6 did not stain Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and stained PNA+ tonsillar lymphocytes in the presence of a large concentration of galactose. When its binding to isolated glycolipids was studied, HJ6 was found to bind globoside and Forssman Ag and not to other glycolipids including CTH. When its binding to neutral glycolipids extracted from tonsillar lymphocytes was studied, HJ6 bound only globoside; Forssman Ag was not detected in tonsillar lymphocytes. Taken together, we conclude that globoside is a B cell Ag expressed on a subpopulation of germinal center B cells. \nTechniques for application of tissue adhesive for corneal perforations. We describe a modified technique of using cyanoacrylate adhesive to seal corneal perforations. Easily performed at the slit lamp, its advantages over previously described methods include a smooth, contoured collagen surface overlying the adhesive, which is easily wet by the tear film. Even greater comfort and protection are provided by the addition of a hydrophilic bandage lens or collagen shield. \nInhibitory effects of procainamide on sympathetic nerve activity in humans. In experimental animals, procainamide causes hypotension and reductions in efferent vasoconstrictor sympathetic outflow that may result from ganglionic blockade or central nervous system sympathetic inhibition. To test the hypothesis that procainamide decreases sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in humans, we recorded postganglionic SNA in seven normal subjects in the baseline state and dur",
