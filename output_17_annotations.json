        "text": "rinopathy that was present at diagnosis. These preliminary results suggest that nitrosourea-based cytotoxic regimens are useful for the initial treatment of children with chiasmal/hypothalamic gliomas, and allow potentially harmful radiation therapy to be deferred until progression of disease. \nTransient prolonged postischemic ventricular dilatation documented by 99mTc MIBI scan. We describe two cases of prolonged postischemic ventricular dilatation during myocardial scintigraphy with 99mTc MIBI, the new perfusion tracer that has only negligible redistribution. Ventricular dilatation, caused by true chamber dilatation and/or subendocardial ischemia, was still present over two hours after the induced ischemic episode, suggesting a prolonged duration of such a commonly believed fleeting scintigraphic finding. \nA randomized clinical study of a calcium-entry blocker (lidoflazine) in the treatment of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. Brain Resuscitation Clinical Trial II Study Group BACKGROUND. Abnormalities of cellular calcium homeostasis have been implicated in the pathophysiology of postischemic encephalopathy. Calcium-entry-blocking drugs inhibit the influx of calcium into cells and have been shown to mitigate postischemic encephalopathy in animal models. METHODS. Five hundred twenty patients with cardiac arrest who remained comatose after the restoration of spontaneous circulation were randomly assigned to receive three doses of lidoflazine, an experimental calcium-entry blocker, or a placebo and were followed for six months. Four patients were lost to follow-up. Treated patients received an intravenous loading dose (1 mg per kilogram of body weight) of lidoflazine and two subsequent doses (0.25 mg per kilogram) 8 and 16 hours after resuscitation. The investigators were blinded to treatment assignment. RESULTS. There was no statistically significant difference between the lidoflazine group (n = 259) and the placebo group (n = 257) in the proportion of patients who died during the six-month follow-up (82 vs. 83 percent), who survived with good cerebral recovery (15 vs. 13 percent), or who survived with severe neurologic deficit (1.2 vs. 1.9 percent). Analysis of the best level of recovery achieved at any time during follow-up also did not show a difference between the treatment groups: 24 percent of those given lidoflazine and 23 percent of those given placebo recovered good cerebral function (normal or only moderately disabled cerebral performance) at some time. CONCLUSIONS. The administration of lidoflazine after cardiac arrest was not found to be beneficial. Our data do not support the routine use of this calcium-entry-blocking drug in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. \nThe ileal neobladder. The ileal neobladder in many respects approximates the theoretically ideal continent urinary diversion. The technique, while more technically demanding than the performance of the standard ileal loop diversion, is not difficult, particularly for surgeons used to performing radical retropubic prostatectomies. The ileal neobladder appears to approximate most closely the optimal bladder substitution. Although currently feasible only in males, future considerations could conceivably involve urologists working with their colleagues in gynecology and colorectal surgery to extend the benefits of bladder substitution using the ileal neobladder to selected patients having cystectomy for associated gynecologic or colorectal malignancies. \nThe intranasal ethmoidectomy: an experience with 1,077 procedures. A series of 1,077 intranasal ethmoidectomies (825 with sphenoid sinusotomies) was performed in 600 patients over a 15-year period at The Mount Sinai Medical Center. The technique is a modification of the classical operation originally proposed by Yankauer. The rate of significant complications was 1.1%. A subset of 90 patients underwent 166 procedures and were followed an average of 3.5 years. The patients were analyzed according to whether the disease was focal or diffuse, infectious or polypoid, and whether asthma was present. The surgical success rate was 88% in nonasthmatics, but dropped to 50% in asthmatic patients despite total sphenoethmoidectomy. This underscores the importance of this condition as a biological modifier of surgical prognosis. Accordingly, a system of classification of sinus diseases is proposed based upon disease extent and type and whether asthma is present. \nConservative treatment of vesicovaginal fistulas by bladder drainage alone. We describe 4 cases of conservative management of vesicovaginal fistulas occurring as a complication of abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy. In all cases treatment involved simple bladder drainage for periods ranging from 19 to 54 days. At follow-up all patients remained dry. Such spontaneous closure of vesicovaginal fistulas following adequate bladder drainage has not been previously reported. \nEffects of early captopril administration on infarct expansion, left ventricular remodeling and exercise capacity after acute myocardial infarction. In a double-blind study, 99 patients (82 men, age range 40 to 75 years) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were randomly assigned to receive captopril or placebo. Treatment began within 24 hours of admission. Serial echocardiographic measurements of endocardial segment lengths and left ventricular (LV) volumes, and ejection fractions were obtained. The 2 groups were matched at baseline except for an excess of previous AMI in the placebo group (13 of 50 vs 2 of 49 patients, p = 0.002). The increase in anterior segment length, from baseline to 2 months, was significantly less in the captopril than in the placebo group (2.8 +/- 1.6 vs 10.4 +/- 2.4mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] -13.5 to -1.7, p = 0.01). The increase in posterior segment length was also less in the captopril group, but the difference was not significant (3.2 +/- 1.2 vs 7.0 +/- 1.8mm, 95% CI -8.0 to 0.5, p = 0.08). Fewer patients in the captopril group demonstrated increases in segment length greater than 2 standard deviations of the measurement error (14 of 70 [20%] vs 29 of 72 [40%] patients, p = 0.009). In patients with anterior AMI, the infarct-containing anterior segment length increased by 4.5 +/- 2.3 mm in the captopril versus 12.4 +/- 3.1 mm in the placebo group (95% CI -15.7 to -0.2, p = 0.046), and fewer patients in the captopril group demonstrated infarct expansion (6 of 20 [30%] vs 13 of 21 [62%] patients, p = 0.04). \nHow AIDS forces reappraisal of hepatitis B virus control in sub-Saharan Africa For developing countries the cost-benefit of vaccination in the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is great since the acute infection is generally subclinical and the benefit is the prevention of small numbers of cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since the pattern of HBV infection in Africa is such that, compared with south-east Asia, infection occurs later in childhood and spread is horizontal rather than vertical, investigation of the method of spread of HBV may result in a means of control other than by vaccination. In the meantime, because of the overlap in the means by which HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are spread, it could be worthwhile taking advantage of existing AIDS prevention programmes to educate people about how to avoid both HBV and HIV infections. \nPulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis. The presentation of a patient with multiple pulmonary nodules with or without cavitation and often with signs of a multisystemic vasculitis should suggest one of the pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis syndromes. The five conditions traditionally considered together in the category of pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis differ widely in their cause and pathogenesis and are more appropriately considered as variants or relatives of other processes. The radiologic features of this group of diseases, however, are similar, and it is useful to still consider them together. Table 1 summarizes the radiologic features of these conditions. \nSplanchnic sympathetic nerve activity and circulating catecholamines in the hyperthermic rat. The mechanisms responsible for the initial rise in splanchnic vascular resistance with environmental heating are controversial, and those responsible for the subsequent fall in splanchnic resistance in the severely hyperthermic animal are unknown. Thus we examined the effect of environmental heating on plasma catecholamine concentration, splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), and select blood chemistries. In one study, 25 male Sprague-Dawley rats (270-300 g) were assigned to one of five groups on the basis of their core temperature (Tc, 37, 39, 41, 43, or 44 degrees C) at death. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and Tc were monitored during heat stress under alpha-chloralose anesthesia (12.5 mg.ml-1.h-1). At each predetermined Tc, an aortic blood sample was drawn and analyzed for mean plasma concentration of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), Na+, K+, and lactate. From 41 to 43 degrees C, NE and E rose significantly, and the animals became hyperkalemic and lactacidemic. In a separate study, we quantitated SNA from the greater splanchnic nerve during heat exposure of artificially respired animals anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). MAP, splanchnic SNA, and Tc were recorded. Tc was elevated from 37.0 +/- 0.12 to 41.3 +/- 0.18 degrees C in 70 min by increase of ambient temperature to 38 degrees C in an environmental chamber. Splanchnic SNA was 54 +/- 8 spikes/s at a Tc of 37 degrees C and increased significantly as Tc exceeded 39 degrees C (P less than 0.05). \nHemodynamic and neurohormonal effects of clonidine in patients with preganglionic and postganglionic sympathetic lesions. Evidence for a central sympatholytic action. BACKGROUND. Clonidine, a partial presynaptic and postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, has been shown to lower blood pressure in normal subjects but not in tetraplegics; however, the mechanisms of this action have not been elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS. The hemodynamic and hormonal basis of the hypotensive action of clonidine was investigated in tetraplegics with complete cervical spinal cord transection and preganglionic sympathetic denervation, in patients with unilateral brachial plexus injury and postganglionic sympathetic denervation, and in normal subjects. In normal subjects, the fall in blood pressure after clonidine infusion was accompanied by a reduction in cardiac output that was predominantly due to a fall in stroke volume and in heart rate. The lack of fall in blood pressure, cardiac output, and stroke volume in tetraplegics indicates that these effects are exerted at a supraspinal level and require intact descending sympathetic pathways. After clonidine infusion, digital skin vasodilatation occurred in normal subjects, in the innervated but not the denervated limb of patients with unilateral brachial plexus injury, and in tetraplegics, indicating that this response is due to the central sympatholytic effect of clonidine. Plasma norepinephrine was much lower in tetraplegics compared with normal subjects, and after clonidine infusion, it fell substantially in normal subjects alone. Plasma renin activity did not change. Bladder stimulation in tetraplegics resulted in a rise in blood pressure and vasoconstriction in digital skin vessels. The inability of clonidine to significantly reduce or abolish the pressor and digital vasoconstrictor responses after bladder stimulation in tetraplegics indicates that clonidine does not exert a major effect on spinal preganglionic neurons or peripheral presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. CONCLUSIONS. Therefore, clonidine is a suitable drug for use in analyzing the central supraspinal levels of control in varying circulatory disorders, such as hypertension and postural hypotension. \nMorbidity of modified pelvic lymphadenectomy and radiotherapy for prostatic cancer. The records of 63 patients treated by pelvic lymphadenectomy and radiotherapy at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, Baptist Memorial Hospital of Memphis, and the Memphis Veterans Affairs Hospital were reviewed. Of those patients, 45 received external beam radiation therapy to the prostate while 16 were treated by Iodine-125 implantation. Two patients had only staging lymphadenectomy. The incidence of postoperative and late complications were analyzed. \nApplication of smooth Teflon clip to inferior vena cava during radical cystectomy to prevent postoperative pulmonary embolism. Between 1976-1986, a smooth Teflon clip was applied to the inferior vena cava of 56 patients who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. The purpose of the clip is to narrow the lumen of the inferior vena cava so that large emboli will be trapped and thus prevented from reaching the lungs. These 56 patients were compared with a group of 26 historical controls who underwent radical cystectomy without application of such a clip between 1967-1976. One patient (1.8%) whose vena cava was clipped had a pulmonary embolus which was fatal. Four (15.4%) of the 26 control patients had postoperative pulmonary emboli, the embolic event being fatal in 3 (11.5%). Application of the smooth Teflon clip to the inferior vena cava significantly lessens the incidence of pulmonary embolism following radical cystectomy. \nPaul Broca and the first craniotomy based on cerebral localization. Paul Broca (1824-1880) was a well-known French surgeon-anthropologist-neurologist. Best known for his work on cerebral cortical localization and speech mechanisms, Broca also carefully worked out skull and scalp localization for underlying cortical regions. In 1871, Broca treated a man who had sustained a scalp laceration from a blow to the head without loss of consciousness or skull fracture. The patient exhibited a nonfluent aphasia about 1 month after injury and became progressively obtunded and eventually comatose. Suspecting an intracranial abscess, Broca trephined at the region of the left third frontal convolution and drained an epidural abscess. The patient improved transiently but died a few days later. Autopsy showed a left-sided, predominantly frontal purulent meningoencephalitis. Broca's other neurosurgical contributions included various surgical cases, methods for scalp localization of the cerebral convolutions, extensive studies of skull and brain abnormalities, thermoencephalography, and the stimulation of younger surgical colleagues and neurologists to make practical use of cerebral localization. \nCoronary restenosis: what have we learned from angiography? Coronary restenosis remains a major problem for interventional cardiology not only by virtue of its frequency, but also because of the current inability to prevent it. Symptomatic status and non-invasive evaluation have been used to study restenosis, but both lack specificity and sensitivity, particularly in patients with multivessel disease. Angiography remains the reference standard. Several arbitrary definitions have been used, some related to visual estimates of coronary stenosis and others to quantitative angiographic techniques. In another approach, linear modeling is used to assess minimal luminal diameter of lesions on restudy. Although angiographic studies have been essential in the study of restenosis, questions concerning the underlying mechanism and pathophysiology remain. The development of animal models that closely resemble human restenosis should allow evaluation of pathophysiologic mechanisms and development of new strategies to prevent the problem. \nMortality due to shigellosis: community and hospital data. Almost all fatal cases of shigellosis occur in developing countries, and data on mortality are generally compiled from three sources: investigations of epidemics caused by Shigella dysenteriae type 1, surveillance of endemic diarrheal disease, and reports from hospitals. Attack rates during epidemics of dysentery due to infection with S. dysenteriae type 1 have ranged from 1% to 33%, and case-fatality rates have ranged from 1% to 7%. In Matlab, a rural district in Bangladesh, most diarrhea-related deaths and approximately 25% of all deaths among children 1 through 4 years of age are attributable to dysentery. In 1984, an epidemic of dysentery was associated with a 42% increase in the death rate in that age group. At the Dhaka Treatment Centre of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, the fatality rate for 970 inpatients with shigellosis was 11% in 1988, with most deaths occurring among malnourished children who were infected with Shigella flexneri. Control of mortality from shigellosis will require prevention of epidemic S. dysenteriae type 1 disease and endemic S. flexneri infections in children who live in countries with a high prevalence of malnutrition. \nDiclofenac delays healing of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions. Double-blind, placebo-controlled endoscopic study in healthy volunteers. The effects of the water-soluble and delayed-release formulations of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, diclofenac, on the healing of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions were compared in a double-blind, double cross-over, placebo-controlled endoscopic study conducted in 14 healthy volunteers. Severe endoscopic lesions (petechiae, erosions, ulcers, and esophageal candidiasis) were found only in the group taking the soluble formulation of diclofenac (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). The endoscopic healing of biopsies at one week was delayed by both preparations in comparison to placebo (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). Neither formulation produced significantly more histological inflammation or minor endoscopic lesions (erythema, red striae) than placebo. Both formulations were equally well tolerated and produced no more symptoms than placebo. This study suggests that soluble diclofenac acts topically to delay gastroduodenal healing and produce gastroduodenal injury; it thus provides a model for future studies of the production, perpetuation, and healing of peptic lesions. \nAuriculotemporal syndrome following the preauricular approach to temporomandibular joint surgery. Forty-seven joints in 28 patients were examined 4 months to 10 years after temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery via a modified preauricular approach. Many patients had undergone multiple procedures. None of the patients had any subjective or objective evidence of auriculotemporal syndrome (ATS), although patients in previous studies with more extensive incisions have demonstrated ATS. It was concluded that ATS is an unlikely complication following TMJ surgery. A small incision without an oblique superior extension may further reduce the risk. \nLeft ventricular hypertrophy: impact of calcium channel blocker therapy. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of the concentric type is the classic cardiac adaptation to sustained arterial hypertension. Data from the Framingham cohort have shown that patients with LVH have a severalfold higher risk of sudden death, acute myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular morbidity than those with normal hearts. Common sequelae of LVH are ventricular ectopy, impaired ventricular contractility, myocardial ischemia, and decreased left ventricular filling. The benefits of antihypertensive therapy should not be limited to lowering arterial pressure, but should extend to preventing or reducing target organ damage. A variety of antihypertensive agents, such as calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antiadrenergic drugs, and, to a lesser extent, beta blockers, have been shown to reduce LVH and to improve left ventricular filling. We have shown that calcium channel blockers diminish ventricular ectopy in parallel with the reduction of LVH, whereas antihypertensive therapy with diuretics neither reduced LVH nor suppressed ventricular ectopy, although it lowered arterial pressure to a similar extent. Whether or not these cardiac changes with antihypertensive therapies will improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with LVH remains to be documented. \nIntrarenal pancreatic cyst. A case report of intrarenal true cyst of the pancreas is presented. The patient presented with flank pain. Her diabetes and hypertension were well-controlled. The cause of the pain was presumed to be a cystic renal mass, which proved to be of pancreatic origin only after the pathologic confirmation from the nephrectomy specimen. \nPreeclampsia as the great impostor. In contrast with a generation ago when preeclampsia was misdiagnosed as medical or surgical disease unrelated to pregnancy, today's diagnostic errors are those that consider surgical and medical problems as either pregnancy-induced hypertension or as the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome. Eleven case histories are presented of significant medical or surgical problems that were initially diagnosed as hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome or pregnancy-induced hypertension. The incorrect diagnosis of medical-surgical cases during pregnancy often meant that appropriate therapy was delayed and that the rate of iatrogenic prematurity was increased. \nArtificially induced ventricular fibrillation in the management of through-and-through penetrating wounds of the aortic arch: a case report. Case report of a 28-year-old woman in whom a through-and-through knife injury of the aortic arch is presented. The hemorrhage could not be brought under control by conventional means and was handled by artificially induced temporary electric fibrillation of the heart, direct suture, and immediate defibrillation. The patient made an uneventful recovery. \nProfound hypothermia (less than 10 degrees C) compared with deep hypothermia (15 degrees C) improves neurologic outcome in dogs after two hours' circulatory arrest induced to enable resuscitative surgery. Deaths from uncontrollable hemorrhage might be prevented by arresting the circulation under protective hypothermia to allow resuscitative surgery to repair these injuries in a bloodless field. We have shown previously that in hemorrhagic shock, circulatory arrest of 60 minutes under deep hypothermia (tympanic membrane temperature, Ttm = 15 degrees C) was the maximum duration of arrest that allowed normal brain recovery. We hypothesize that profound cerebral hypothermia (Ttm less than 10 degrees C) could extend the duration of safe circulatory arrest. In pilot experiments, we found that the cardiopulmonary system did not tolerate arrest at a core (esophageal) temperature (Tes) of less than 10 degrees C. Twenty-two dogs underwent 30-minute hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure 40 mm Hg), rapid cooling by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), blood washout to a hematocrit of less than 10%, and circulatory arrest of 2 hours. In deep hypothermia group 1 (n = 10), Ttm was maintained at 15 degrees C during arrest. In profound hypothermia group 2 (n = 12), during cooling with CPB, the head was immersed in ice water, which decreased Ttm to 4 degrees-7 degrees C. The Tes was 10 degrees C in all dogs during arrest. Reperfusion and rewarming were by CPB for 2 hours. Controlled ventilation was to 24 hours, intensive care to 72 hours. In the 20 dogs that followed protocol, best neurologic deficit scores (0% = normal, 100% = brain death) at 24-72 hours were 23% +/- 19% in group 1 and 12% +/- 8% in group 2 (p = 0.15). Overall performance categories and histologic damage scores were significantly better in group 2 (p = 0.04 and p less than 0.001, respectively). We conclude that profound cerebral hypothermia with CPB plus ice water immersion of the head can extend the brain's tolerance of therapeutic circulatory arrest beyond that achieved with deep hypothermia. \nDependency of the pulsed Doppler-derived transmitral filling profile on the sampling site. In previous reports that evaluated pulsed Doppler transmitral filling, the sampling site has varied; we examined the effect of the sample volume location on Doppler measurements. Studied were 97 patients: 58 with normal echocardiograms, 20 with mitral regurgitation, and 19 with miscellaneous cardiac diseases. Transmitral filling was recorded at the mitral anulus and at the left atrial and left ventricular (LV) sides of the mitral tips. As the sample volume was moved from the mitral anulus to the LV side, the peak velocity and time-velocity integral of early diastole increased (40.6 +/- 13.8 versus 59.0 +/- 19.0 cm/sec, 5.26 +/- 1.65 versus 8.35 +/- 2.37 cm; p less than 0.001) as did those of late diastole (48.7 +/- 11.5 versus 57.5 +/- 17.0 cm/sec, 3.48 +/- 0.97 versus 4.59 +/- 1.39 cm; p less than 0.001). The late-to-early diastolic peak velocity and time-velocity integral ratios and the late-to-total diastolic time-velocity integral ratio decreased (1.33 +/- 0.51 versus 1.06 +/- 0.41, 0.71 +/- 0.24 versus 0.58 +/- 0.19, 0.40 +/- 0.09 versus 0.36 +/- 0.08; p less than 0.001). The dependency of these indices on the sampling site was in the same degree in all three groups. However, the peak filling rate normalized to mitral stroke volume (4.71 +/- 1.43 versus 4.63 +/- 1.32 l/sec; p = NS) was not influenced by the sample volume location; thus this parameter may be more reliable for assessing LV filling. \nHemorrhagic cardioembolic stroke: is anticoagulation absolutely contraindicated? Hemorrhagic cerebral embolism should not be considered an absolute contraindication to immediate low-dose systemic anticoagulation. Low levels of anticoagulation may give some protection from recurrent embolism while minimizing the risks of intracranial bleeding. Until further studies are available, these decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis, supported by limited scientific information. \nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy: 111 consecutive cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy removes the gallbladder through three or four puncture wounds in the abdominal wall. The technique reduces the recuperative time to full activity, from as long as 4 wk to as little as 3 days, compared with conventional cholecystectomy. We herein present our initial experience with this procedure. In this series of 111 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, there were no mortalities and only one morbidity. Thirty-nine patients (35%) had a history of prior abdominal surgery. Fourteen underwent laparoscopic lysis of adhesions. Intraoperative cholangiograms were performed in 24 patients (21%), demonstrating choledocholithiasis in three. Two of the three patients underwent postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP); in the other, laparoscopic common bile duct exploration was performed. In each case, the common bile duct (CBD) was completely cleared of stones. Incidental laparoscopic appendectomy was also performed in three patients. The average time for completion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in cases of chronic cholecystitis was 40 min. If the gallbladder was acutely inflamed, the procedure took a mean of 126 min. This series had a higher percentage of patients (19%) with acute cholecystitis then previously reported; therefore, the 2% conversion rate in this series emphasizes the broad applicability of the technique. The average length of stay in the hospital was 1.4 days, and patients returned to work in about 7 days. \nLiver glutathione and cytochrome P450 activity in experimental infection: study of the relative effects of infectious stress and malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of infection and malnutrition on liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 (P450) in rats. DESIGN: Controlled experimental groups (12 groups). ANIMALS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Experimental endocarditis, pyelonephritis, or peritonitis were caused. Controls included free-fed rats and sham-operated rats, pair-fed to infected animals. Infection was verified by tissue culture. Rats were killed 3 days (acute infection) or 10 days (chronic infection, except endocarditis) after the induction of infection. RESULTS: Sham rats had lower liver weights, liver/body weight, and liver glutathione values than controls. Infected rats had larger liver weights and liver/body weight ratios and liver glutathione content than shams, and larger liver/body weight ratios than controls (acute infection). Infected rats had lower P450 values than both shams and controls. CONCLUSION: The malnutrition associated with infection caused decreased liver weight and glutathione content. Infection increased the liver weight, and liver glutathione content, but caused severe reduction in liver P450. If the same finding is true in infected patients, it could have consequences for the management of such patients. \nMetsovo lung outside Metsovo. Endemic pleural calcifications in the ophiolite belts of Greece. Endemic PCs and high incidence of malignant mesothelioma from household use of asbestos have been reported in Metsovo in northwestern Greece (\"Metsovo lung\"). In the present study, we present similar findings in six more areas of Greece. Like Metsovo, all these areas are located within ophiolite belts. Like Metsovo, material similar to \"Metsovo whitewash\" has been used for various domestic uses. Asbestos fibers (chrysotile, antigorite and tremolite) were found in three of the six areas. Also, in two, MPM has been diagnosed. These findings suggest that \"Metsovo lung\" occurs in several areas of Greece and has similar etiology and epidemiology. \nValidation of continuous radionuclide left ventricular functioning monitoring in detecting silent myocardial ischemia during balloon angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Silent myocardial ischemia has been inferred from transient ST-segment depression during continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Recently, continuous ambulatory monitoring of left ventricular (LV) function using a radionuclide technique (VEST) has demonstrated episodes of significant silent LV dysfunction in the absence of electrocardiographic changes. To validate the demonstration of silent LV dysfunction with this technique, 12 men were studied during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A total of 18 left anterior descending coronary artery balloon inflations were performed. Balloon inflations at 8 +/- 2 atm (4 to 10 atm) lasted 70 +/- 16 seconds. Seventeen of 18 inflations were associated with a decrease in LV ejection fraction greater than 0.10. Mean LV ejection fraction decreased from 0.53 +/- 0.08 to 0.28 +/- 0.11 (p less than 0.0001). In contrast, there was pain in only 10 inflations and ST-segment changes in 7. LV dysfunction was associated with a minimal increase in end-diastolic volume (4 +/- 3%, p less than 0.003), and a major increase in relative end-systolic volume (69 +/- 43%, p less than 0.001). These data suggest that continuous monitoring of LV function with the VEST can sensitively detect silent ischemic decreases in LV function occurring during angioplasty, and provide further validation of the use of this technique for detecting silent myocardial ischemia. \nThe metabolic bone disease of primary sclerosing cholangitis. The incidence and severity of osteopenic bone disease in primary sclerosing cholangitis is poorly defined. Clinical, biochemical and radiographic assessment and bone mineral density measurements of the lumbar spine were carried out in two groups of patients. Group 1 consisted of 30 patients with advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis; group 2 consisted of 18 patients with newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis. Only one patient had bone pain. All patients were normocalcemic; two had elevated serum parathormone levels. Fourteen patients (47%) from group 1 but no patients from group 2 had low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Mean bone mineral density was significantly reduced in group 1 patients (0.97 +/- 0.04 gm/cm2) compared with age-matched and sex-matched controls (1.25 +/- 0.01 gm/cm2, p less than 0.0001), and in 15 patients (50%) bone mineral density was below the fracture threshold (0.98 gm/cm2). The bone mineral density in group 2 was not significantly different from controls, and no patient was below the fracture threshold. In neither group did bone mineral density correlate with serum bilirubin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, fecal fat excretion, previous drug therapy or the presence of chronic ulcerative colitis. Histomorphometrical examination of bone from four group 1 patients showed increased bone resorption, reduced bone formation, moderate-to-severe osteopenia and no osteomalacia. In conclusion, severe osteopenic bone disease is common in advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis and, like that seen in other cholestatis diseases, is consistent with osteoporosis. \nLeft ventricular performance during propofol or methohexital anesthesia: isotopic and invasive cardiac monitoring. Using gated radionuclide ventriculography and invasive cardiac monitoring, the effects of propofol and methohexital on left ventricular volumes and function were investigated in 22 unpremedicated patients (ASA physical status III, 50-78 yr) with chronic coronary artery disease (NYHA class II-III). Anesthesia was induced with either propofol or methohexital (2 mg/kg), followed by a maintenance infusion of 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Vecuronium (0.05 mg/kg) was administered and ventilation (FIO2, 1.0) was manually controlled (FECO2, 0.04-0.05). Data acquisitions were serially obtained over 15 min. Propofol and methohexital anesthesia caused an average 15% decrease in mean arterial pressure, associated with a 20% decrease in cardiac index without a decrease in systemic vascular resistance index. It is interesting that the determinants of these hemodynamic effects were different. Heart rate did not change during propofol infusion despite the decrease in mean arterial pressure, whereas heart rate increased during methohexital infusion. In the propofol group, the decrease in cardiac index was associated with decreases in indicators of preload (end-diastolic volume and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), whereas end-systolic volume and global ejection fraction did not change statistically. In the methohexital group, the decrease in cardiac index was associated with a decrease in global ejection fraction and an increase in end-systolic volume, whereas indicators of preload remained unchanged. It is concluded that methohexital reduces left ventricular performance. In contrast, propofol preserves left ventricular performance despite a likely negative inotropic effect. \nChemical shift artifact: dependence on shape and orientation of the lipid-water interface. On magnetic resonance images, chemical shift artifact (CSA) can be seen at a planar lipid-water interface oriented within the plane of the phase-encoding and section-select directions (ie, perpendicular to the frequency-encoding direction). Phantoms and a clinical case were used to demonstrate that when a lipid-water interface is curvilinear (eg, spherical) or planar but not oriented along the section-select direction, CSA may be absent or diminished. This effect can be seen at interfaces of normal structures (kidneys, bladder) as well as at interfaces with pathologic lesions such as lipid-containing dermoids. Not only is this effect dependent on section thickness, field of view, matrix size, and receiver bandwidth, but it is also strongly dependent on the orientation of the interface with respect to the section-select direction. Knowledge of the factors that can alter CSA is important since it is used to distinguish lipid-containing from nonlipid-containing structures of similar signal intensities. \nExercise echocardiography as a screening test for coronary artery disease and correlation with coronary arteriography. We evaluated exercise echocardiography as a screening test for coronary artery disease in 228 patients, all of whom underwent subsequent coronary angiography. After an echocardiogram at rest was obtained, each patient performed maximal, symptom-limited, upright treadmill exercise, immediately after which repeat imaging was performed. The exercise echocardiogram was abnormal if any segment failed to become hypercontractile with exercise, and these regional wall motion abnormalities were used to predict the extent and distribution of coronary disease. At subsequent angiography, coronary stenosis was defined as significant if luminal diameter was reduced greater than or equal to 50%. Compared with electrocardiography, exercise echocardiography was more sensitive (97 vs 51%) and specific (64 vs 62%), and had higher positive (90 vs 82%) and negative (87 vs 28%) predictive accuracies. Exercise echocardiography was also highly predictive of the extent (no, 1-, 2- or 3-vessel disease) and distribution (which vessel) of coronary stenoses. It is concluded that exercise echocardiography is an excellent screening test for the presence, extent and distribution of coronary artery disease. \nPotential of parenteral and enteral nutrition in inflammation and immune dysfunction: a new challenge for dietitians [published erratum appears in J Am Diet Assoc 1991 Aug;91(8):913] Advances in the understanding of the interrelationship between immunology and nutrition indicate that immune dysfunction in critically ill patients is linked with nutrient deficiency and abnormal acute-phase response to illness. Immune dysfunction requires special nutrition therapy and metabolic support; immunoregulation by nutrition manipulation may lead to specific immunotherapies for defined groups of patients. The success of dietary strategies must be measured not only by metabolic indexes but also by effects on immune function. The health profession must combat immune dysfunction and inflammation for the sick and frail patients under its care. \nCerebrovascular events after myocardial infarction: analysis of the GISSI trial. Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI). OBJECTIVES--To describe the epidemiology of cerebrovascular events in patients given or not given fibrinolytic treatment and to assess the prognostic implications and risk factors. DESIGN--Case series derived from the GISSI randomised trial. SETTING--176 coronary care units in Italy giving various levels of care. PATIENTS--5860 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with 1.5 million units of intravenous streptokinase and 5852 patients not given fibrinolytic treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cerebrovascular event, sex, age, blood pressure, history of previous infarct, site of infarction, and Killip class. RESULTS--99 of 11,712 patients (0.84%) had a cerebrovascular event. Older age, worse Killip class, and anterior location of infarction seemed to be risk factors for cerebrovascular events (40/3201 aged 65-75 v 42/7295 aged less than 65, odds ratio 2.18; 9/437 class 3 v 55/8277 class 1, 1.81; and 57/4878 anterior v 24/4013 posterior, 1.96). No significant difference was found in the rate of cerebrovascular events between patients treated with streptokinase and controls (45/5852 (0.92%) streptokinase v 54/5860 (0.77) control). More patients in the streptokinase group than in the control group had cerebrovascular events (especially haemorrhagic strokes) on day 0-1 after randomisation (27 streptokinase v 7, control), although this was balanced by late events in control patients (54 streptokinase v 45 control at one year). The mortality of patients who had a cerebrovascular event was higher than that of those who did not (47% (47/99) v 11.6% (1350/11,613]. CONCLUSIONS--Although the incidence of cerebrovascular events complicating myocardial infarction was low, they increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment with streptokinase did not significantly alter the incidence, but age and poor haemodynamic state were associated with an increased risk. \nTreatment of 813 zygoma-lateral orbital complex fractures. New aspects. A 10-year experience with surgical treatment of 813 zygomalateral orbital complex fractures is reviewed. Regardless of the type or severity of the fracture pattern, concomitant fractures of the orbital floor and rim were approached exclusively through the transconjunctival approach without a lateral canthotomy. The advantages of this approach compared with the subciliary access are the avoidance of a visible scar and markedly reduced incidence of postoperative lower eyelid complications such as ectropion and edema. Implants of lyophilized dura or cartilage and autogenous bone were used to reconstruct orbital floor defects. Malar asymmetry is a frequent complication of zygoma fractures resulting from inadequate three-dimensional reduction. Methods for accurate reduction and stabilization, indications for closed and open reduction, and management of the fractured infraorbital rim are emphasized. The indications for miniplates vs wire ligatures for the infraorbital rim are discussed. Long-term follow up and evaluation of the results with regard to the fracture pattern, complications, maxillary sinus dysfunction, and facial and orbital symmetry are presented. \nAltered cell-mediated immunity to group A haemolytic streptococcal antigens in chronic plaque psoriasis. The proliferative lymphocyte response to sonicated group A, beta-haemolytic streptococci (Strep-A) was measured by thymidine incorporation in 78 patients with psoriasis (guttate, chronic plaque or both). Lymphocytes from 72 of these patients were also cultured with streptokinase/streptodornase (SK/SD), and 20 of the patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were further tested with PPD, Candida albicans and sonicated Streptococcus mutans, a bacterial type not associated clinically with psoriasis. The median stimulation index (SI) of the psoriasis group to the Strep-A preparation was significantly higher than that of a group of 27 non-psoriatic individuals (P less than 0.05). Within this group, only the patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (n = 42) showed a significantly increased proliferative response compared to the non-psoriatic controls (median SI = 123.8 and 31.9, respectively, P less than 0.01). Although the lymphocyte response of the chronic plaque group to SK/SD was also markedly higher than that of the control group, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In addition, these patients did not show significantly increased responses to any of the other antigens tested, including S. mutans. No correlation was observed between the degree of proliferation to Strep-A and disease extent or activity. Similarly, ASO titres, which were raised in 11 out of 23 guttate and three out of nine chronic plaque psoriasis patients tested, did not correlate with the proliferative responses observed. \nAsymptomatic celiac and superior mesenteric artery stenoses are more prevalent among patients with unsuspected renal artery stenoses. The prevalence of unsuspected renal artery stenosis among patients with peripheral vascular disease has been reported to be as high as 40%, but the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac and superior mesenteric artery stenoses in these patients is not known. The biplane aortograms of 205 male patients who were military veterans and had aneurysms or occlusive disease were independently reviewed, and medical records were studied to determine associated coronary disease, risk factors, and patient outcome. Fifty-six patients (27%) had a 50% or greater stenosis in the celiac or superior mesenteric artery, and seven patients (3.4%) had significant stenoses in both mesenteric arteries. Patients with celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were older (p = 0.002) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.029) than those without significant mesenteric stenoses. Fifty of the 205 patients had significant renal artery stenoses, and 20 had advanced (greater than 75% diameter loss) renal stenoses. Ten of the 20 patients (50%) with advanced renal stenoses had a concomitant celiac artery stenosis, compared to 40 of the 185 patients (22%) who did not have advanced renal stenoses (p = 0.011). In the present study asymptomatic celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were common among male veterans evaluated for peripheral vascular disease, but the prevalence of significant stenoses in both the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries was low. The prevalence of significant celiac stenosis was higher in patients with advanced (greater than 75%) renal artery stenoses who might be considered for prophylactic renal revascularization. Lateral aortography with evaluation of the celiac artery is always appropriate in these patients. \nLichen sclerosus and squamous hyperplasia of the vulva. A clinical study of medical treatment. One hundred thirty-eight cases of nonneoplastic epithelial disorders of the vulva treated with medical therapy from 1984 to 1988 were evaluated at the University of Florence, Florence, Italy. The 67 cases of lichen sclerosus were treated with testosterone propionate or progesterone ointment for 32 weeks. The 31 cases of squamous hyperplasia were treated with corticosteroid ointment for 16 weeks. The 40 patients with lichen sclerosus associated with squamous hyperplasia were treated with corticosteroid ointment for 12 weeks and then with testosterone propionate ointment for another 20. To evaluate the efficacy of the treatments, the patients were examined before and after therapy. The evaluation took into account the symptoms and gross appearance of the lesions, which were given a score of 1-3. Considering all the cases evaluated, a total regression of symptoms occurred in 82 patients (59.4%), while a partial regression occurred in 37 (26.8%). Furthermore, there was a total regression of gross changes in 68 cases (49.3%) and a partial one in 43 (31.1%). The best results were obtained with squamous hyperplasia, which lichen sclerosus, alone or associated with squamous hyperplasia, yielded less successful results. \nResults of the Duhamel operation in the treatment of idiopathic megarectum and megacolon. The results of the Duhamel operation in patients with idiopathic megarectum and megacolon have been reviewed. Twenty patients (14 males, six females) underwent the Duhamel operation over a 17-year period for this condition. The mean age at operation was 25 years; the mean age of onset of constipation was 3 years; and the mean follow-up period was 4.5 years. All the resected colons were of enlarged diameter. There was agreement between the preoperative radiographs and the operative specimens with regard to which parts of the rectum and colon were dilated. Subjective feelings of well-being were generally improved by surgery, as was bowel frequency in ten patients. Soiling, straining, abdominal pain and distension were, however, common after operation. Early complications were also common and five patients required further surgery for constipation. The Duhamel operation for megarectum and megacolon is characterized by an improved sense of well-being and improved bowel frequency, but it is associated with the persistence of many symptoms and further surgery is often required. \nAcute transient thrombocytopenia associated with cocaine abuse in pregnancy. A case is described of cocaine-induced severe transient thrombocytopenia associated with a hypertensive crisis at 21 weeks' gestation. Liver function tests and coagulation studies were all within normal ranges. Blood pressure was controlled with hydralazine. This clinical presentation, similar to severe preeclampsia, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute hypertension and low platelet count, especially in early gestations when preeclampsia is relatively rare. Unlike severe preeclampsia, for which active intervention and delivery are usually selected, cocaine-related hypertension-thrombocytopenia, especially in very premature gestations, may warrant conservative management. \nSuccessful treatment of adult Henoch-Schonlein purpura with factor XIII concentrate. We report the cases of three adult patients with severe abdominal complications of Henoch-Schonlein purpura who had low activity of factor XIII during the acute phase of the disease. In all three cases, abdominal symptoms and purpura immediately responded to heat-treated, placenta-derived factor XIII concentrate. No adverse effects were experienced. Factor XIII concentrate replacement should be considered as the initial treatment for severe abdominal symptoms in adult Henoch-Schonlein purpura associated with a decreased level of factor XIII activity. \nAn evaluation of multiple clinical variables for hypoxia during colonoscopy. One hundred consecutive patients undergoing routine colonoscopy were evaluated for changes in arterial oxygen saturation levels. All of the patients were monitored with the Nellcor N-200 pulse oximeter (Nellcor Incorporated) by finger probe and received supplemental oxygen when SaO2 levels decreased below 90 per cent. Forty patients demonstrated a decrease in SaO2 to less than 90 per cent after intravenous sedation but prior to colonoscopy, 14 patients demonstrated a decrease in SaO2 to less than 90 per cent during colonoscopy, and 46 patients maintained SaO2 levels greater than 90 per cent at all times. No statistical differences were found when these three groups were compared for age, body surface area, drug dosage, smoking history and a history of pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, arrhythmias, angina or myocardial infarction and pulmonary disease. These data indicate that all patients undergoing colonoscopy should be placed on supplemental oxygen. We further recommend continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring when available. \nRecurrent pneumoperitoneum following vaginal insufflation. The authors report a case of a 24-year-old nulligravida woman who presented to the hospital with complaints of severe abdominal pain and radiographic evidence of pneumoperitoneum. She had two prior nondiagnostic laparotomies for similar complaints and radiographic findings. After a careful sexual history was taken the patient revealed that she had sexual intercourse preceding every similar episode including this one, during which her partner forcefully blew air into her vagina. Pneumoperitoneum associated with vaginal insufflation has been previously reported in two multigravida patients with and without anatomic abnormalities. When pneumoperitoneum is present in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms or trauma, a meticulous sexual history should be made to avoid unnecessary laparotomies. \nCoronary stenting with a new, radiopaque, balloon-expandable endoprosthesis in pigs. BACKGROUND. Intracoronary stents may be effective when used as \"bail-out\" devices for acute complications after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Furthermore, preliminary reports have demonstrated some promising results with stents with regard to the reduction of restenosis. Several stent devices are available for preclinical and clinical evaluation. The use of these stainless-steel stents has been limited by poor visibility during fluoroscopy and thrombogenicity during the first days to weeks after implantation. We therefore investigated the immediate and short-term effects on arterial patency of a new, radiopaque, balloon-expandable coil stent in normal coronary arteries of pigs. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 10 animals, a stent was placed in two of the three epicardial coronary arteries. During the implantation procedure, the animals received heparin; after the procedure, no antithrombotic drugs were administered. After 1 week (five animals and 10 stents) or 4 weeks (five animals and 10 stents), repeat angiography was performed, followed by pressure-fixation of the coronary arteries for light and electron microscopic examination. Angiographic analysis revealed that all stented coronary segments were patent and without signs of intraluminal defects. Scanning electron microscopy showed complete endothelial covering of all stents within 7 days. Light microscopy showed a reduced tunica media locally under the stent wires, which resulted from exerted pressure. The neointima on top of the stent wires measured 56 microns (range, 42-88 microns) after 1 week and 139 microns (range, 84-250 microns) after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS. Results from this study show that this radiopaque endoprosthesis can be safely placed in normal coronary arteries of pigs. After 4 weeks, all stents were patent and there was no need for additional antithrombotic treatment, whereas neointimal proliferation was limited. \nPromoter region of the human platelet-derived growth factor A-chain gene. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A- and B-chain genes are widely expressed in mammalian tissues and their homodimeric gene products appear to regulate the autocrine growth of both normal and transformed cells. In this study, we analyzed the 5' flanking sequences of the human PDGF A-chain gene to seek elements important to regulating its transcription. The promoter region was exceptionally G + C-rich and contained a \"TATA box\" but no \"CAAT box.\" The transcription start site was identified 845 base pairs 5' to the translation initiation site by S1 nuclease mapping and by primer extension. Both in vitro transcription and transient expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to the PDGF A-chain 5' flanking sequences established that the putative promoter region was active, and RNase H mapping established that the three characteristic mRNAs (1.9, 2.3, and 2.8 kilobases) used the same transcription start site, which was used in normal endothelial cells and in two human tumor cell lines that express high levels of A-chain transcripts. The results established an exceptionally G + C-rich promoter region and a single transcription start site active for each of the three mRNAs of the PDGF A-chain gene. DNA sites of potential importance in mediating the activation of the PDGF A-chain gene in normal cells and in transformed cell lines expressing high levels of PDGF A chain were identified. \nOperative laparoscopy with the Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of endometriosis and pelvic adhesions. A multicenter, prospective trial was initiated to test the effectiveness and safety of the Nd:YAG laser equipped with artificial sapphire contact tips for the laparoscopic treatment of pelvic pain. Ninety-three women were enrolled in the study, 37 with endometriosis alone, 47 with endometriosis complicated by pelvic adhesions, and 9 women with adhesions alone. In over 90% of adhesions and 96% of endometriotic implants the Nd:YAG laser could be delivered to the site and be used to restore normal anatomy. The exception was deep bowel involvement with endometriosis, which was not treated. The majority of women had marked reduction or resolution of their symptoms for up to 12 months postoperatively. We conclude that the use of the Nd:YAG laser is an appropriate method to laparoscopically treat pelvic pain resulting from endometriosis or pelvic adhesions. \n'Designer drugs'. Treating the damage caused by basement chemists. Use of \"designer drugs\" has created a new dilemma for physicians. Generally, it is possible to recognize symptoms and signs of intoxication that fit a specific class of substances, such as amphetamine-like effects for the phenylethylamines and opioid effects for the fentanyl analogues. Designer compounds have crossed these boundaries, and toxicology laboratories cannot readily identify them. For now, physicians must rely on clinical presentation and treat accordingly. \nHigh-energy orbital dislocations: the possibility of traumatic hypertelorbitism. In a 4-year period from 1983 to 1987, 7160 patients with blunt injuries were admitted to the Maryland Institute of Emergency Medical Services Systems Shock Trauma Center. Facial injuries occurred in 10 percent of this population. High-energy fractures (characterized by computed tomography) were seen in approximately 10 percent of these patients. In this high-energy group, five cases of high-energy orbital dislocations, some representing examples of traumatic hypertelorbitism, were observed. They represent 1.5 percent of the 342 midface fractures observed and 4.8 percent of the naso-orbital ethmoid fractures observed (105 patients). One additional patient is described who was seen at the UCLA Medical Center for late repair of the condition. High-energy impacts of the upper midface created fractures of both orbits, zygomas, and nasoethmoidal regions permitting lateral transposition, enlargement, and divergence of the orbits. Interorbital, intercanthal, and interpupillary distances were increased, criteria that confirm the diagnosis of hypertelorbitism. Fifty percent of the patients were bilaterally blind, and one patient sustained unilateral blindness. \nHemorrhage and intracranial hypertension in combination increase cerebral production of thromboxane A2. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: To determine the effects of reduced cerebral perfusion pressures produced by hemorrhage alone or in combination with intracranial hypertension on thromboxane A2 (TxA2) production, we undertook a randomized study in 38 anesthetized, mongrel dogs. Animals were subjected to 30 mins of hemorrhagic shock with normal (group 1) or increased (group 2) intracranial pressure (ICP). Group 1 animals (n = 22) were hemorrhaged to reduce cerebral perfusion pressure to 40 mm Hg for 30 mins. In group 2 (n = 16), cerebral perfusion pressure was reduced by the combination of less severe hypotension and intracranial hypertension (20 mm Hg). Cerebral and systemic hemodynamic measurements were recorded, including cerebral blood flow (sagittal sinus outflow method); ICP; cerebral perfusion pressure; and arterial and cerebral venous concentrations of TxB2 (double-antibody radioimmunoassay technique), the major metabolite of TxA2. Data were obtained at baseline and at the beginning and end of the 30-min shock period. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic shock significantly (p less than .05) decreased cerebral blood flow in both groups. At the beginning of the shock period, cerebral blood flow was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p less than .05) and venous-arterial differences in TxB2 increased significantly (p less than .05) in group 2, but not in group 1. At the end of the 30-min shock period, venous-arterial levels of TxB2 remained significantly (p less than .05) higher in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Increased cerebral production of TxA2 during hypotension accompanied by intracranial hypertension may contribute to the severity of neural damage produced by the combination of head trauma and shock. \nRole of oxygen-derived free radicals in myocardial edema and ischemia in coronary microvascular embolization BACKGROUND. Oxygen-derived free radicals are thought to injure the ischemic heart during coronary microvascular embolization. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test this idea, microspheres (15 microns in diameter) were repetitively administered into the left anterior descending coronary artery to cause microvascular embolization in dogs. Myocardial contractile and metabolic dysfunctions were significantly attenuated after treatments with recombinant human superoxide dismutase, an acyl derivative of ascorbic acid (CV3611, 2-O-octadecylascorbic acid), and xanthine oxidase inhibitor (allopurinol). The free radical scavengers and inhibitor enhanced the coronary hyperemic flow response during embolization, and the total number of microspheres causing maximal embolization was increased by these drugs. When 8-phenyltheophylline was additionally administered with superoxide dismutase, these beneficial effects were abolished, indicating that coronary effects of these drugs may be due to increased release of adenosine during coronary microvascular embolization. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that oxygen radicals worsen the ischemic injury in coronary microembolization. \nGenesis of arrhythmias in the failing heart and therapeutic implications. Between 50 and 70% of patients with heart failure die suddenly and unexpectedly before they have deteriorated to New York Heart Association class IV symptoms. It has long been known that ventricular ectopy predicts sudden cardiac death in coronary heart disease, and this has also been shown in dilated cardiomyopathy. It is less certain whether antiarrhythmic drugs reduce this risk and improve prognosis. Supraventricular arrhythmias frequently develop in heart failure of all causes. They nearly always cause symptoms, and the establishment of atrial fibrillation may mark a permanent deterioration. Except for sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias are often occult. Hypokalemia and digitalis toxicity may have been precipitated by diuretics or interaction with antiarrhythmic drugs. In coronary heart failure, arrhythmias may be related to scar tissue or ischemia, which may also be responsible in dilated cardiomyopathy. Use of inotropes and inodilators may precipitate arrhythmias, whereas drugs that conserve energy or potassium, such as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may prevent them. Since suppression of ventricular arrhythmias has not been shown to prevent sudden death or prolong life in patients with heart failure, it may be that such arrhythmias do not directly presage ventricular fibrillation except in so far as they are markers of a poor prognosis with a risk of sudden death. If so, such arrhythmias are most likely to be suppressed by agents that result in improvement of left ventricular function and, through that, prolongation of life. \nRegimen compliance two years after myocardial infarction. Two-years postinfarction, the effect of a nursing intervention at 30 days postinfarction, and intentions, attitudes, and perceived beliefs of others on regimen compliance of myocardial infarction patients was investigated. The sample was comprised of 51 patients (E = 29, C = 22) who participated in a five-phase study over 2 years. No differences were found between experimental and control groups for regimen compliance to activity, stress, and medication prescriptions. The experimental group was significantly more compliant to the diet prescription than the control group. The control group was significantly more compliant than the experimental group with cessation from smoking. Perceived beliefs of others were predictive of compliance for all regimen prescriptions at 2 years. Attitude was also predictive of compliance with the diet, smoking, and stress regimens. \nHigh-dose cisplatin with dacarbazine and tamoxifen in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. In an attempt to increase the antitumor effect of cisplatin (50 mg/m2) and dacarbazine (350 mg/m2), each repeated on days 1 to 3 every 4 weeks in patients with metastatic melanoma, tamoxifen was added to the regimen. Before the first course of chemotherapy, the patients received a loading dose of tamoxifen (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days), followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg orally twice a day and continued throughout the treatment. Aspirin (325 mg orally every other day) was administered at the same time as the tamoxifen in an attempt to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. The activity of high-dose cisplatin with dacarbazine and tamoxifen was disappointing. Of 23 evaluable patients, only three responded--an overall response rate of 13% (95% confidence limits, 0% to 27%). These responses consisted of one pathologic complete remission in a patient with nodal metastases, one clinical complete remission in a patient with a very large pelvic mass, and one partial response in another patient with nodal metastases. The duration of responses was 12+, 4, and 4 months, respectively. These data do not support a significant interaction between tamoxifen and cisplatin or dacarbazine. Assuming that tamoxifen is important in the cisplatin, dacarbazine, and carmustine combination, as suggested by others, the most relevant interaction may be between tamoxifen and carmustine. \nCytologic diagnosis of leukemia and lymphoma. Values and limitations. The value and limitations of the cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma and leukemia using a multiparameter approach, including cytomorphology, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry, are discussed. Using these diagnostic modalities, most subtypes of lymphoma and leukemia can be classified accurately. The differential diagnoses of the different disease entities also are presented. \nLeft ventricular mass in childhood dilated cardiomyopathy: a possible predictor for selection of patients for cardiac transplantation. To determine the relationship of left ventricular hypertrophy (as assessed by mass) to symptoms and cardiac function in chronic childhood dilated cardiomyopathy, 17 long-term survivors (12 asymptomatic, 5 symptomatic) were studied at a median follow-up of 6.25 years (1.25 to 16.8 years). Left ventricular mass, dimension, wall stress, and contractility (relationship between velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and end-systolic wall stress) were assessed by echocardiography. These data were compared to measurements at the onset of disease. At follow-up, mass decreased significantly from the onset in the asymptomatic patients but remained elevated in the symptomatic patients (101 +/- 35 gm/m2 to 54 +/- 12 gm/m2, p = 0.001; 122 +/- 55 gm/m2 to 198 +/- 115 gm/m2, p = 0.23, respectively). Shortening fraction and contractility were both significantly lower in the symptomatic group compared with the asymptomatic group at follow-up (shortening fraction = 21 +/- 7% vs 29 +/- 5%, p = 0.02; contractility = -0.24 +/- 0.14 circ/sec vs -0.05 +/- 0.11 circ/sec, p = 0.01). Follow-up wall stress was slightly higher in symptomatic patients compared with asymptomatic patients. Three symptomatic patients had progressive hypertrophy and either died or required transplantation. Higher left ventricular mass is associated with the presence of symptoms, depressed contractility, and slightly higher wall stress. Persistence or progression of hypertrophy may be a poor prognostic sign in survivors of childhood dilated cardiomyopathy. Measurement of mass may be useful to indicate the necessity for closer follow-up to select patients for cardiac transplantation before hemodynamic decompensation. \nGranulomatous hypersensitivity to Schistosoma mansoni egg antigens in human schistosomiasis. III. In vitro granuloma modulation induced by immune complexes. Granulomatous hypersensitivity to parasite eggs of Schistosoma mansoni is an important factor in the development of morbidity in chronic schistosomiasis. It has been demonstrated previously that the chronic, well-tolerated, intestinal form of schistosomiasis is associated with the establishment and maintenance of a variety of immunoregulatory mechanisms. We have used an in vitro model of granuloma formation for the purpose of studying the regulation of granulomatous hypersensitivity to S. mansoni egg antigens, mediated by immune complexes (IC). Our results show that the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with active schistosome infections, when treated with sera from chronic schistosomiasis patients, were able to induce an inhibitory activity on in vitro granuloma formation. Significant modulation of the in vitro granuloma reaction remained after treatment of PBMCs with isolated IC or manufactured IC with soluble egg antigen (SEA) and purified IgG from pooled chronic schistosomiasis sera. In contrast to granuloma modulation stimulated with whole molecule IgG-SEA IC, the incubation of PBMCs with F(ab')2 IgG-SEA IC did not induce any suppression of the granulomatous hypersensitivity to SEA. It appears in this model system that IC may inhibit the activity of granuloma formation by stimulating macrophages to release suppressive mediators. We have demonstrated this possibility by inhibition of prostaglandin activity using indomethacin. The addition of indomethacin to the granuloma culture significantly reduced in vitro granulomatous hypersensitivity to S. mansoni eggs in patients with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis and do so by inducing macrophages to secrete prostaglandins. \nCushing's disease and cutaneous alternariosis. Alternaria species are common plant pathogens, but a rare cause of human infection. We present a patient with cutaneous alternariosis that revealed a relapse of an old case of Cushing's disease. Immunosuppression following the excessive glucocorticoid production seemed to contribute to the development of dermatosis. We also present a review of the literature on the association of Cushing's disease and cutaneous alternariosis. Our case is unique because the ketoconazole therapy that we used was successful in the treatment of both diseases. \nEsophagocutaneous fistula after anterior cervical spine surgery and successful treatment using a sternocleidomastoid muscle flap. A case report. An esophagocutaneous fistula following anterior cervical fusion is rare. A 61-year-old man had cervical myelopathy because of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine. Anterior decompression of the cervical spine and anterior fusion with strut bone grafting were performed. A second anterior fusion was done because the graft was dislodged after the patient fell out of bed one month after surgery. An esophagocutaneous fistula occurred three months after the second anterior surgery. One of the causes of this esophagocutaneous fistula was considered to be a pressure necrosis of the esophagus because of to projection of the bone graft. Conservative treatment, which consisted of wound drainage and intravenous administration of antibiotics, was tried but was unsuccessful. A good result was achieved by cancellous bone grafting, closure of the esophageal fistula, and transposition of a sternocleidomastoid muscle flap to the interspace between the esophagus and the cervical spine. \nDiazepam binding inhibitor and its processing products stimulate mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis via an interaction with mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors. A recognition site for benzodiazepines structurally different from that linked to various gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor subtypes is located on the outer mitochondrial membranes of steroidogenic cells. This protein has been signified to be important in the regulation of steroid biosynthesis. Because of its location it is designated herein as the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR). A putative endogenous ligand for MBR is the peptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), previously shown to displace drugs from MBR and to be expressed and stored in steroidogenic cells rich in MBR. The two model systems used to study steroidogenic regulation by DBI were the Y-1 adrenocortical and MA-10 Leydig cell lines previously shown to be applicable in studies of mitochondrial steroidogenesis. Both cell lines contain DBI as well as DBI processing products, including the DBI fragments that on reverse phase HPLC coelute with the naturally occurring triakontatetraneuropeptide [TTN; DBI-(17-50)] and octadecaneuropeptide [DBI-(33-50)]. When DBI purified from rat brain was added to mitochondria prepared from Y-1 and MA-10 cell lines, it increased the rates of pregnenolone formation in a dose-related manner. In both cell lines, maximal stimulation (3-fold) of mitochondrial steroidogenesis was obtained with 0.33 microM DBI, with an EC50 of approximately 0.1 microM. However, DBI concentrations higher than 1 microM caused a smaller increase in pregnenolone formation. Flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine that binds with high nanomolar affinity to MBR, was recently shown to act as an antagonist of ACTH and LH/hCG-induced steroidogenesis and was found in the present studies to inhibit DBI-stimulated mitochondrial steroidogenesis. During the incubation with mitochondria, DBI was partially processed to different peptide fragments, including octadecaneuropeptide and TTN. To determine whether DBI processing products influence mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis, several DBI fragments and other peptides structurally unrelated to DBI were tested. Among these, only TTN stimulated mitochondrial steroid synthesis in a dose-dependent manner similar to DBI. \nUse of centrally acting sympatholytic agents in the management of hypertension. Considerable evidence suggests that hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is implicated not only in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension but also in several blood pressure-independent complications of essential hypertension. Even with the advent of newer antihypertensive agents, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists, the centrally acting sympatholytics (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists) remain a valuable group of medications for the management of hypertension of all grades of severity. Their advantages include efficacy; rarity of contraindication; absence of most metabolic and serious side effects; favorable effects on systemic hemodynamics; lack of true tolerance and infrequency of volume expansion-related pseudotolerance; suitability in the elderly, in isolated systolic hypertension, and in patients with various concomitant conditions, such as diabetes mellitus; ability to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy; and relative low cost. The long duration of action of guanfacine hydrochloride, the most recently marketed agent, and of the transdermal formulation of clonidine is an especially commendable feature. The principal disadvantages of this class of medications are an overlap between the therapeutic dosage and that producing sedation and dry mouth and the potential to cause the discontinuation syndrome and sexual dysfunction. \nPrevention of neural tube defects: results of the Medical Research Council Vitamin Study. MRC Vitamin Study Research Group. A randomised double-blind prevention trial with a factorial design was conducted at 33 centres in seven countries to determine whether supplementation with folic acid (one of the vitamins in the B group) or a mixture of seven other vitamins (A,D,B1,B2,B6,C and nicotinamide) around the time of conception can prevent neural tube defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, encephalocele). A total of 1817 women at high risk of having a pregnancy with a neural tube defect, because of a previous affected pregnancy, were allocated at random to one of four groups--namely, folic acid, other vitamins, both, or neither. 1195 had a completed pregnancy in which the fetus or infant was known to have or not have a neural tube defect; 27 of these had a known neural tube defect, 6 in the folic acid groups and 21 in the two other groups, a 72% protective effect (relative risk 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.71). The other vitamins showed no significant protective effect (relative risk 0.80, 95% Cl 0.32-1.72). There was no demonstrable harm from the folic acid supplementation, though the ability of the study to detect rare or slight adverse effects was limited. Folic acid supplementation starting before pregnancy can now be firmly recommended for all women who have had an affected pregnancy, and public health measures should be taken to ensure that the diet of all women who may bear children contains an adequate amount of folic acid. \nEpitope map of neurofilament protein domains in cortical and peripheral nervous system Lewy bodies. A subset of demented elderly patients exhibit large numbers of cortical intraneuronal inclusions similar to the neurofilament (NF)-rich Lewy bodies (LB) found in pigmented subcortical neurons of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Because these cortical inclusions may contribute to the emergence of cognitive impairments in afflicted individuals, the authors mapped the distribution of NF epitopes in these so-called cortical LBs. This was done using ethanol-fixed tissues and a large library of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with well-characterized binding specificities to various regions of each NF triplet protein. Cortical LBs were examined by light, confocal, and electron microscopy, and they were compared with the subcortical LBs of PD and LBs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Monoclonal antibodies specific for the rod regions of each of the three NF subunits, or for phosphate-dependent and independent antigenic sites in the tail region of the high- (NF-H) and middle- (NF-M) molecular weight (Mr) NF subunits as well as other MAbs to the extreme COOH terminus of NF-L and NF-M or the head region of NF-M labeled a variable number of cortical LBs. Remarkably one of these anti-NF MAbs, RMO32, which recognized a phosphorylated epitope in the tail region of NF-M, immunolabeled nearly all cortical LBs, whereas each of the other anti-NF MAbs never labeled more than 10% of ubiquitin- or RMO32-positive cortical LBs. Further LBs in the PNS resembled those in the central nervous system (CNS) in their immunologic properties, and LBs in both sites were dominated by filamentous aggregates at the ultrastructural level. These findings suggest that NF proteins are profoundly altered during their incorporation into cortical and PNS LBs. Further the authors here identified immunologic and ultrastructural properties common to cortical LBs, PNS LBs, and classic substantia nigra LBs in PD. The accumulation of filamentous, perikaryal inclusions rich in NF proteins at diverse sites in the CNS and PNS of patients with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders suggests a widespread disruption of NF metabolism or transport. \nPreventing fetal damage from sexually transmitted diseases. The STDs threaten the reproductive health of women in many ways, ranging from premature births through congenital infections and death. An understanding of the natural history of these diseases permits timely interventions which can mitigate the perinatal damage caused by these infections substantially. Ideally, primary prevention or safer sex will be adopted by sexually active women, thereby reducing the morbidity not only for their offspring but for themselves as well. Antiviral therapy is not yet available for minimizing any hazard of fetal exposure to HPV, HSV, HIV, and hepatitis B viral infections. Early antibiotic therapy should reduce the risk of congenital syphilis and any perinatal hazards associated with chlamydial and gonococcal infections. \nPharmacology of antimigraine drugs. The drugs used in migraine therapy can be divided into two groups: agents that abort an established migraine attack and agents used prophylactically to reduce the number of migraine attacks. Both groups have drugs that are specific for migrainous headaches and that are non-specific, and are used to treat the accompanying headache (analgesics), vomiting (anti-emetics), anxiety (sedatives and anxiolytics), or depression (antidepressants). The main drugs with specific action on migraine include ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine), agonists (sumatriptan) or partial agonists (methysergide) at a specific subtype of 5-HT1-like receptors, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol, metoprolol), calcium antagonists (flunarizine) and anti-inflammatory agents (indomethacin). The pharmacological basis of therapeutic action of several of these drugs is not well understood. In the case of the ergot alkaloids and 5-HT1-like receptor agonists, however, it is likely that the antimigraine effect is related to the potent and rather selective constriction of the large arteries and arteriovenous anastomoses in the scalp and dural regions. In addition, these drugs inhibit plasma extravasation into the dura in response to trigeminal ganglion stimulation, but it is possible that this effect is related to the selective vasoconstriction in the extracerebral vascular bed. The selectivity of the pharmacological effects of these antimigraine drugs (constriction of the extracerebral arteries and arteriovenous anastomoses, poor penetration into the central nervous system and the absence of an antinociceptive effect even after intrathecal administration) strongly suggests that excessive dilatation in the extracerebral cranial vasculature, probably initiated by a neuronal event, is an integral part of the pathophysiology of migraine. \nPerivalvular extension of infection in patients with infectious endocarditis. Perivalvular extension of infection is a not-infrequent and potentially fatal complication of bacterial endocarditis. Because the efficacy of various modalities in the diagnosis of such complications is not well established, a selective review of the published literature on this issue is worthwhile. The electrocardiogram is the easiest study to obtain. It is quite specific in identifying perivalvular extension of infection when conduction system disease is demonstrated but has a low degree of sensitivity overall. Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and color-flow Doppler echocardiography are the most practical and useful techniques for diagnosis of perivalvular extension of infection. Magnetic resonance imaging also appears to be an effective tool in this setting; however, because of a paucity of clinical data, its precise utility has not yet been determined. Nuclear medicine studies and computed tomography play a minimal role. Cardiac catheterization is as useful as the echocardiographic techniques but is invasive, not as readily available, and significantly riskier in terms of complications. An approach to the diagnosis of perivalvular extension of infection is proposed on the basis of the literature review. \nAssessing drugs for the treatment of heart failure. The aims of treatment in patients with heart failure, as with any other condition, are to relieve symptoms and prolong life. A secondary objective is to do so at the lowest possible economic cost. When treatment of the cause of heart failure is possible--which usually means some form of surgery, but could include treatment of a primary disease, such as thyrotoxicosis--then this is obviously the treatment of choice. In patients for whom there is no such definitive treatment, a wide and increasing variety of drugs are available. When new antifailure drugs are to be developed there are therefore two problems: first, to ensure that they are more effective than placebo treatment, and second, to compare them with existing drugs. Both of these tests can present ethical difficulties, for it is unreasonable to withhold established effective treatment in order to conduct a placebo-controlled trial, and when drugs are being compared, it is unlikely that any new medication will be dramatically superior to an old one. The more effective the treatments already available, the harder it becomes to evaluate a new drug. \nThe extent and time course of motoneuron involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The numbers and relative sizes of motor units have been estimated in 373 muscles of 123 patients with ALS: 74 of the muscles were examined on more than one occasion. The median duration between the onset of symptoms and the initial examination was 12 months; by this time, approximately 90% of the tested muscles showed losses of motor units. The evoked motor unit potentials continued to enlarge in most, but not all, muscles as the disease progressed. Once a muscle became affected by the disease process, the average time-course was such that the motor unit population halved in each 6-month period of the first year and diminished more slowly thereafter. A small proportion of patients was encountered in whom the disease progressed much more slowly and there were occasional large fluctuations in the motor unit estimates suggestive of reversible motoneuron dysfunction. \nProstacyclin production and mediation of adenylate cyclase activity in the pulmonary artery. Alterations after prolonged hypoxia in the rat. Prostacyclin is a critical mediator of structure and function in the pulmonary circulation, causing both the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle growth and vasodilation via the stimulation of adenylate cyclase. To examine the potential role of alterations in prostacyclin production or mechanism of action in chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, we determined the effects of prolonged (7 d) in vivo hypoxia on in vitro prostacyclin synthesis and mediation of adenylate cyclase activity in rat main pulmonary arteries. In control arteries prostacyclin production exceeded that of prostaglandin (PG) E2 by 25-fold, with 42% originating from the endothelium. Studies utilizing indomethacin revealed that endogenous prostaglandins mediate at least 69% of basal adenylate cyclase activity. Prostacyclin-stimulated enzyme activity was enhanced by exogenous GTP, indicating that this is a receptor-mediated process involving G protein amplification. Comparable dose-related responses to prostacyclin and PGE2 suggest that these agents may activate a common receptor. After 7 d of in vivo hypoxia there was a 2.7-fold increase in in vitro prostacyclin production, with equivalent increases in synthesis in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. However, despite this increase there was no change in basal adenylate cyclase activity, and this was associated with attenuated sensitivity of the enzyme to prostacyclin stimulation. Concomitant diminution of the response to beta-adrenergic stimulation, with previously-demonstrated beta receptor downregulation and unaltered postreceptor-mediated activity, suggests that the blunted response to prostacyclin is due to receptor downregulation. Parallel studies of the thoracic aorta indicated that these changes are specific to the pulmonary artery. It is postulated that attenuation of the response of adenylate cyclase to prostacyclin may contribute to the structural changes and hypertension observed in the pulmonary vasculature of the rat with chronic hypoxia. \nPrognostic value of a treadmill exercise score in outpatients with suspected coronary artery disease BACKGROUND. The treadmill exercise test identifies patients with different degrees of risk of death from cardiovascular events. We devised a prognostic score, based on the results of treadmill exercise testing, that accurately predicts outcome among inpatients referred for cardiac catheterization. This study was designed to determine whether this score could also accurately predict prognosis in unselected outpatients. METHODS. We prospectively studied 613 consecutive outpatients with suspected coronary disease who were referred for exercise testing between 1983 and 1985. Follow-up was 98 percent complete at four years. The treadmill score was calculated as follows: duration of exercise in minutes--(5 x the maximal ST-segment deviation during or after exercise, in millimeters)--(4 x the treadmill angina index). The numerical treadmill angina index was 0 for no angina, 1 for nonlimiting angina, and 2 for exercise-limiting angina. Treadmill scores ranged from -25 (indicating the highest risk) to +15 (indicating the lowest risk). RESULTS. Predicted outcomes for the outpatients, based on their treadmill scores, agreed closely with the observed outcomes. The score accurately separated patients who subsequently died from those who lived for four years (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve = 0.849). The treadmill score was a better discriminator than the clinical data and was even more useful for outpatients than it had been for inpatients. Approximately two thirds of the outpatients had treadmill scores indicating low risk (greater than or equal to +5), reflecting longer exercise times and little or no ST-segment deviation, and their four-year survival rate was 99 percent (average annual mortality rate, 0.25 percent). Four percent of the outpatients had scores indicating high risk (less than -10), reflecting shorter exercise times and more severe ST-segment deviation; their four-year survival rate was 79 percent (average annual mortality rate, 5 percent). CONCLUSIONS. The treadmill score is a useful and valid tool that can help clinicians determine prognosis and decide whether to refer outpatients with suspected coronary disease for cardiac catheterization. In this study, it was a better predictor of outcome than the clinical assessment. \nRadioimmunodetection of neuroblastoma with iodine-131-3F8: correlation with biopsy, iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine and standard diagnostic modalities. Iodine-131-3F8, a murine IgG3 monoclonal antibody specific for ganglioside GD2 was evaluated by radioimmunoscintigraphy in 42 patients with neuroblastoma. Comparison was made with 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scans, as well as computed axial tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Iodine-131-3F8 detected more abnormal sites (283) than [131I] MIBG (138) or 99mTc-MDP (69), especially in patients with extensive disease. In 20 patients with soft-tissue tumors demonstrated by CT/MRI, 131I-3F8 detected the disease in 18. Upon surgical resection, two tumors interpreted as negative with 131I-3F8 imaging revealed ganglioneuroma, one showing microscopic foci of neuroblastoma. In contrast, 131I-3F8 imaging identified tumors that were confirmed histologically as neuroblastomas. In 26 patients with evidence of marrow disease by antibody scans, 14/26 had confirmation by iliac crest marrow aspirate/biopsy examinations. We conclude that 131I-3F8 scintigraphy has clinical utility in the management of patients with neuroblastoma by improving the sensitivity of tumor detection. \nPrognostic significance of the number of metastatic lymph nodes in patients with gastric cancer. To confirm the prognostic significance of the number of the metastatic lymph nodes (MLN) in cases of gastric cancer, the results of surgical treatment of 668 patients with primary gastric cancer were analyzed retrospectively. Five-year survival rates were calculated with reference to the number of MLN, namely, none (89.2%), one to three (77.4%), four to six (55.8%), and seven or more (36.2%). Furthermore, even when the cancer had invaded the serosa, 5-year survival was significantly more frequent in patients with one to three MLN (71.7%) than in those with four to six (35.5%) or more than six (31.5%) (P less than 0.01), and the 5-year survival was close to that of patients with no MLN (70.5%). Not only qualitative but also quantitative evaluation of lymph node metastasis is essential for estimating the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. \nCulture, illness, and the biopsychosocial model. Family medicine has appropriated the biopsychosocial model as a conceptualization of the systemic interrelationships among the biological, the psychological, and the social in health and illness. For all its strengths, it is questionable whether this model adequately depicts the centrality of culture to the human experience of illness. Culture (as meaning system) is not an optional factor that only sometimes influences health and illness; it is prerequisite for all meaningful human experience, including that of being ill. A more adequate model of the relationship between culture and illness would demonstrate the preeminence of culture in the experience of illness among all people, not just members of \"exotic\" cultures; would view healers as well as patients as dwellers in culture; would incorporate the role of culture as meaning system in linking body, mind, and world; and would promote the significance of the cultural context as a resource for research and therapy. \nvon Willebrand factor and factor VIII in renal transplant recipients under immunosuppression with cyclosporine and steroids. Sequential measurements over 4 months in 17 patients. In 17 consecutive cadaver kidney transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine (CsA) and steroids, the median of antigenic and functional levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) before transplantation were elevated (vWF:Ag: 206%, vWF:RCof: 202%; FVIII:Ag: 248%, FVIII:C: 224%; normal values 50-150%). Sequential measurements after transplantation and during CsA treatment revealed a transient significant increase of median values with highest amounts of vWF:Ag of 362% (2 p less than 0.0001), FVIII:Ag of 398% (2 p less than 0.001) and FVIII:C of 360% (2 p less than 0.0001) (Friedman test). vWF:RCof did not show statistically significant changes. After 4 months, levels of vWF and FVIII comparable to those obtained before transplantation were observed. In univariate statistical analysis no correlation was found between vWF of FVIII on the one hand and plasma creatinine levels, CsA dose or CsA whole blood through levels on the other hand. However, multivariate statistics revealed to some extent a positive influence of CsA blood levels on vWF:Ag levels. Patients with vascular rejection or chronic CsA nephrotoxicity showed significantly lower levels of vWF:Ag as compared with patients without endothelial cell damage in the kidney (2 p less than 0.05). However, the difference in vWF:Ag levels already existed before transplantation. In contrast to recent reports, plasma vWF levels were not indicative of vascular injury in kidney graft recipients nor was the marked elevation of vWF and FVIII associated with thromboembolic complications ascribed to CsA treatment. \nLiver involvement in Alpers disease. Alpers disease consists of diffuse cerebral degeneration manifested as developmental delay, seizures, vomiting, and progressive neuromuscular deterioration, with liver disease and death. We report the clinical course of the liver disease, histologic progression of the hepatic lesions, and etiologic investigations in five patients (four girls, three kinships). All had grown and developed normally until seen at 6 to 36 months of age (mean 20 months), with vomiting (n = 5), progressive hypotonia (n = 3), or seizures (n = 2). All had been given anticonvulsants, including valproic acid in three. Liver disease was noted at a mean age of 35 months (range 9 to 67 months), with hepatomegaly (two patients), abnormal hepatic synthetic function (three) or transaminase values (three), and cirrhosis in one. Patients survived for a mean of 4.6 weeks (range 1 to 8 weeks) after the identification of liver disease; all died of hepatic failure. Results of evaluation for infectious and metabolic causes of liver disease and causes of degenerative neuromuscular disease were negative in all patients. Premortem liver biopsy specimens (n = 3) demonstrated an early lesion consisting of lobular disarray, microvesicular steatosis, periportal acute and chronic inflammation, and individual hepatocyte necrosis. Autopsy findings (n = 5) consisted of macrovesicular steatosis, massive hepatocyte dropout, and proliferation of bile ductular elements, with almost complete replacement of hepatocytes by proliferating bile ductular elements in two patients. Brain showed characteristic neuronal degeneration. We conclude that Alpers disease can be a cause of rapidly progressive liver failure in early childhood. Although the cause of this autosomal recessive disease is not known, it does not appear to be related to peroxisomal dysfunction. \nVulnerability of nerve fibres to ischaemia. A quantitative light and electron microscope study. In order to learn more about the vulnerability of nerve fibres to ischemia, a quantitative study of nerve fibre abnormalities was performed on biopsy specimens of the superficial branch of the peroneal nerve from 26 patients with vasculitic neuropathy: 20 had necrotizing arteritis, 5 a lymphocytic, and 1 a leucocytoclastic vasculitis on nerve and/or muscle biopsy. The density of myelinated fibres ranged from 25 to 7880 per mm2 (n = 8470 +/- 706 (SD]. There was a marked inequality in the density of nerve fibres between the fascicles of individual nerves with a mean coefficient of variation of 41 +/- 37 (SD) % versus 7.4 +/- 3.0% in controls. Loss of myelinated fibres, which was greater for fibres larger than 7 microns in diameter, was more severe than that for unmyelinated axons. Regeneration, which was assessed by the number of clustered axons, decreased when the density of myelinated fibres decreased, suggesting that severe nerve ischaemia precludes axonal regeneration. Wallerian degeneration affected on average 58% (range 5-100%) and segmental demyelination, mainly of the secondary type, on average 1.94% (range 1-10%) of teased fibres. It was concluded that (1) myelinated fibres are more vulnerable to ischaemia than unmyelinated axons; (2) large myelinated fibres are affected before the smaller ones; (3) segmental demyelination is uncommon in this context; (4) severe nerve ischaemia precludes axonal regeneration. \nThe role of endogenous free radical scavengers on tissue recovery in the experimental ulcer model. The role of lipid peroxidation and endogenous oxygen-derived free radical scavengers on ischemia-reperfusion injury and tissue recovery in rat ulcer model corresponding to the gastric histopathology was investigated. Male Wistar rats weighting 200-250 g were heparinized before occlusion of the celiac axis for 1.5 h. Endogenous CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, fumarase, cytochrome c oxidase, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive compounds as lipid peroxidation products were measured in the gastric tissue at 3 h, and 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after release and in the controls (no occlusion). At 3 h after release, erosion of the gastric mucosa was observed, and gastric ulcers beyond the muscularis mucosae were present in the gastric body 2 days later. Seven days after release, gastric ulcers had disappeared. Activity levels for all five enzymes (CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, fumarase, and cytochrome c oxidase) were low for days 1-4 after release and did not return to control levels by the seventh day. It was observed that the ulcer formation, as evidenced by the histopathology, was significantly related to the levels of endogenous CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, fumarase, and cytochrome c oxidase activities. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive compounds were also low through the entire course of ulcer formation. The study concludes that decreases in the levels of these oxygen-derived free radical scavengers may result in the formation of gastric ulcers; however, endogenous free-radical scavengers may not correspond with tissue recovery. Lipid peroxidation may not be related to ulcer formation. \nComparison of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone in acute myocardial infarction. Urochinasi per via Sistemica nell'Infarto Miocardico (USIM) Collaborative Group. In a randomized trial of the effects on in-hospital mortality of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone, 2,531 patients with acute myocardial infarction in 89 coronary care units were enrolled for greater than 30 months. Patients admitted within 4 hours of the onset of pain were randomized to receive either intravenous urokinase (a bolus dose of 1 million U repeated after 60 minutes) plus heparin (a bolus dose of 10,000 U followed by 1,000 IU/hour for 48 hours) or heparin alone (infused at the same rate). Complete data were obtained in 2,201 patients (1,128 taking urokinase and 1,073 taking heparin). At 16 days, overall hospital mortality was 8% in the urokinase and 8.3% in the heparin group (p = not significant). Among patients with anterior infarction, mortality was 10.3% in the urokinase and 13.9% in the heparin group (p = 0.09; relative risk = 0.73). The incidence of major bleeding (urokinase 0.44%, heparin 0.37%) as well as the overall incidence of stroke (urokinase 0.35%, heparin 0.20%) was similar in the 2 groups. The rates of major in-hospital cardiac complications (reinfarction, postinfarction angina) were also similar. \nLanguage functions in progressive supranuclear palsy. Languag",
