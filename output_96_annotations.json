        "text": "with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis. Molsidomine, a long-acting vasodilator mainly used as an antianginal agent, was reported to decrease the portohepatic venous pressure gradient in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. This study investigated the effects of linsidomine, the active metabolite of molsidomine, on systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics in rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis using the microsphere technique. Compared with placebo-treated rats, linsidomine-treated animals were found to have a significant decrease in portal venous pressure (-18%, p less than 0.01) and in mean arterial pressure (-16%, p less than 0.01), smaller peripheral resistances (p less than 0.01), greater portal venous inflow (p less than 0.05), smaller splanchnic arteriolar resistances (p less than 0.01) and smaller protocol-lateral resistances (p less than 0.05). Cardiac output, hepatic arterial blood flow, portal blood flow and estimated hepatic blood flow were not significantly different between the two groups of animals. Linsidomine-treated rats exhibited a trend toward greater collateral blood flow compared with controls, but this difference was not significant. We conclude that linsidomine decreases portal venous pressure by reducing portocollateral resistances without affecting liver blood flow. These effects should be beneficial for patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. \nCervical anterior spinal artery syndrome associated with cardiopulmonary arrest. Nontraumatic spinal cord ischemia is uncommon, especially when the cervical cord is involved. We present an elderly man who sustained acute occlusion of the anterior spinal artery at a high cervical level. This was followed by a respiratory arrest due to the paralysis of the diaphragm and chest wall muscles. A review of the vascular supply to the cord and of nontraumatic ischemic myelopathy is provided. \nIntermediate procedures after first-stage Norwood operation facilitate subsequent repair. Actuarial analysis of survival after first-stage palliative reconstructive operation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome has revealed a high out-of-hospital attrition rate over the first 18 months to 2 years postoperatively. Some of this mortality is related to development of anatomical problems such as restrictive atrial septal defect, neoaortic arch obstruction, and pulmonary artery distortion. The bidirectional Glenn shunt has proved to be an ideal adjunctive procedure for high-risk patients at the time of operation to correct such intermediate-term problems. The fenestrated Fontan procedure, which involves fenestration of the interatrial baffle placed as part of our current standard Fontan procedure, is applied for patients considered to be at moderate risk for a Fontan procedure. The decision regarding closure of the fenestration is made by hemodynamic study including temporary balloon occlusion of the fenestration. The fenestration is closed with the double-clamshell device, which is placed percutaneously in the catheterization laboratory and which is currently used for secundum atrial septal defect closure. Appropriate selection of patients for the bidirectional Glenn shunt or fenestrated Fontan procedure with or without fenestration closure has resulted in a dramatic decrease in mortality and morbidity for patients with all forms of single ventricle and for patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. \nSupratentorial dermoid cysts. Supratentorial dermoid cysts are rare lesions. In eight cases presented here, the lack of recurrence after subtotal removal of the capsule and the good long-term prognosis are emphasized. This finding is in agreement with the literature. The frequent relationship of these lesions with the cavernous sinus suggests a vascular genesis in the development of intracranial dermoid cysts. \nEpilepsy and employment. A community based survey in an area of high unemployment. A community based survey was undertaken to assess the work record of patients with epilepsy in an area of high unemployment. One hundred and thirty seven epileptic patients were identified from a population of 23,837 persons of employable age registered with three urban group practices in North East England. The unemployment rate for economically active patients with epilepsy was 46% compared with 19% for an age and sex matched control population (p less than 0.01). Fifty nine per cent of patients with active epilepsy were unemployed. In those with an associated neurological or psychiatric handicap and those who were unskilled manual workers the unemployment rates were 79% and 77%, respectively. Patients with epilepsy were less likely to leave school with qualifications or undergo subsequent training or apprenticeships. They were more likely to be unskilled manual workers, single and living in rented accommodation. In an area of high unemployment patients with epilepsy have disproportionately greater difficulty finding work. High unemployment rates among patients with epilepsy are only one aspect of a spectrum of social and economic disadvantage. \np53 mutations in human lymphoid malignancies: association with Burkitt lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We have investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in B- and T-cell human lymphoid malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the major subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. p53 exons 5-9 were studied by using genomic DNA from 197 primary tumors and 27 cell lines by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments. Mutations were found associated with (i) Burkitt lymphoma (9/27 biopsies; 17/27 cell lines) and its leukemic counterpart L3-type B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5/9), both of which also carry activated c-myc oncogenes, and (ii) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (6/40) and, in particular, its stage of progression known as Richter's transformation (3/7). Mutations were not found at any significant frequency in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In many cases, only the mutated allele was detectable, implying loss of the normal allele. These results suggest that (i) significant differences in the frequency of p53 mutations are present among subtypes of neoplasms derived from the same tissue; (ii) p53 may play a role in tumor progression in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia; (iii) the presence of both p53 loss/inactivation and c-myc oncogene activation may be important in the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma and its leukemic form L3-type B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. \nRenal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval involvement. Renal cell carcinoma extends into the lumen of the inferior vena cava in approximately 4% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Surgical removal of the intracaval tumor thrombus with radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for this malignancy. From January 1977 to June 1990, 31 such patients were examined for combined problems of renal carcinoma and intracaval tumor extension. Twenty-six of these patients underwent radical nephrectomy and vena caval thrombectomy. Ten patients had tumor thrombus confined to the infrahepatic vena cava, 11 had retrohepatic caval involvement, and 5 had extension to the level of the diaphragm or into the right atrium. Surgical approach was dictated by the level of caval involvement. Control of the suprahepatic vena cava plus temporary occlusion of hepatic arterial and portal venous inflow were necessary in some cases; cardiopulmonary bypass was required for transatrial removal of more extensive tumors. Five of the 26 patients had evidence before operation of distant metastatic disease; none of these survived beyond 12 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of the 21 patients without known preoperative metastatic disease was 57%. Complete surgical excision of all gross tumor appears to be critical for long-term survival in these patients. \nEosinophil activation and T lymphocyte infiltration in allergen-induced late phase skin reactions and classical delayed-type hypersensitivity. T lymphocyte infiltration is a well documented feature of classical delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Recently, we have shown that T lymphocytes and activated (EG2+) eosinophils accumulate in the allergen-induced late phase skin reaction (LPR). To compare the kinetics and phenotypic composition of these T lymphocyte responses, LPR and DTH reactions of comparable induration size were induced in atopic subjects. In addition, DTH and LPR were compared between atopic and nonatopic subjects. In atopic individuals, allergen challenge elicited a perivascular influx of T lymphocytes that was predominantly CD4+. Eosinophil accumulation and activation were also prominent. There was no cellular response to allergen challenge in the nonatropic group. In both groups, DTH responses showed an intense T cell infiltrate which was more dense and dispersed than in the LPR. CD4+ T cells predominated but at 48 h CD8+ numbers were also significantly increased. In DTH, total leukocyte numbers (CD45+) were increasing at 48 h, whereas in the LPR, cell numbers reached a plateau between 24 and 48 h. T cell activation (shown by expression of IL-2R) was more prominent in DTH. Endothelial expression of HLA-DR was increased in both LPR and DTH, implying the local release of inflammatory cytokines in both reactions. Small but significant numbers of activated eosinophils (EG2+) were detected in atopics and non-atopics at 24 h in DTH but not at 48 h. These findings suggest that the allergen-induced LPR induced in atopic subjects is, at least in part, a form of cell-mediated hypersensitivity but with T cell kinetics that differ from classical DTH. \nDouble-blind comparison of perindopril and captopril in hypertension. Effects on left ventricular morphology and function. Using digitized M-mode echocardiograms, we compared, in a double-blind study, the effects of 4 to 8 mg perindopril given once daily and 25 to 50 mg captopril given twice daily on the left ventricle (LV) in 20 hypertensive patients. Both treatments significantly (P less than .001) lowered blood pressure, reducing systemic vascular resistances. After 3 months both drugs induced a comparable percentage of reduction in LV mass, with an increase in the peak rate of LV relaxation and no changes in the peak rate of LV contraction. Our results demonstrate that perindopril once daily is an effective antihypertensive agent; it is also able, like captopril, to induce regression of LV hypertrophy, with improvement in diastolic performance and no deterioration in ventricular systolic function. \nOptic neuropathy and central nervous system disease secondary to Sjogren's syndrome in a child. The authors describe a 10-year-old girl in whom optic neuropathy and central nervous system (CNS) disease developed in association with primary Sjogren's syndrome. There was angiographic evidence of cerebral vasculitis and multiple infarcts present on neuroimaging. Results of parotid biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid, and serologic analyses showed abnormalities that were consistent with the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome. Although the patient had optic disc pallor on initial evaluation, her color vision and acuity improved with immunosuppressive therapy, as did her other neurologic symptoms. The authors believe this represents the first reported case of optic neuropathy and CNS disease associated with primary Sjogren's syndrome in the pediatric population. The possibility of improvement in visual function with early institution of immunosuppressive therapy makes prompt diagnosis essential. \nPosthypoxic myoclonus (the Lance-Adams syndrome) in the intensive care unit. The neurological assessment of patients admitted to the intensive care unit after successful resuscitation from cardiopulmonary arrest may be difficult. We describe the cases of two patients who developed myoclonus within 24 hours of hypoxic respiratory and cardiac arrest. Initially, the clonic movements were thought to be generalised convulsions and were treated as such, until it became evident that the patients were aware and distressed. Posthypoxic myoclonus is a rare complication of successful cardiopulmonary resusitation. Recognition depends on the awareness that the syndrome exists, and is important so that correct therapy can be instituted. There may be important prognostic implications. Both our patients had normal intellectual recovery with moderate residual neurological disability from their movement disorder. \nTrauma-precipitated migrainous hemiparesis. Migraine is a pleomorphic condition in which neurologic manifestations may be absent or a minor or a major feature. Similarly, head injury may range from trivial to lethal with regard to neurologic morbidity. Migraine may be precipitated by a variety of stimuli, including head trauma, significant or trivial. Presented is the case of a patient with migrainous hemiparesis precipitated by minor head injury. The clinical features and laboratory and radiological findings of trauma-precipitated migraine are reviewed. \nThe development of a Norwegian pain questionnaire. The study was undertaken to develop a multidimensional measuring instrument for pain in the Norwegian language. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) was used as a model as it is a valid and reliable tool for pain measurement in English speaking countries. A series of steps were taken to develop a Norwegian pain questionnaire: (1) words describing pain were derived from 95 subjects (patients, students and health personnel); (2) 10 subjects allocated pain descriptors into groups; (3) 36 college student validated the word groupings; (4) 72 patients graded the words contained in each group according to intensity; and (5) the reliability of group items was tested. The study demonstrated that there are many descriptors of pain in the Norwegian language. The final version of the Norwegian pain questionnaire consisted of 106 pain descriptors divided into 18 groups. Validity of the classifications as well as reliability of the words was demonstrated. The actual value of the Norwegian pain questionnaire as a measuring instrument has not yet been documented. \nVentricular arrhythmias. When should they be suppressed? Patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature complexes who do not have evidence of heart disease should not be treated with either class I or class III (Vaughan Williams) antiarrhythmic drugs. Patients who are symptomatic may be given beta blockers. In patients who have heart disease, a number of risk factors may play a part, and the decision regarding therapy is more difficult. However, symptomatic patients with either sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia must be treated with antiarrhythmic agents. In some patients, implantation of an automatic defibrillator may be necessary. \nEffect of atenolol on myocardial infarct expansion in a nonreperfused rat model. Acute myocardial infarct expansion is associated with a poor prognosis. This study was performed to assess potential beneficial effects of beta-blockers on inhibiting expansion. A pilot study showed that atenolol (10 mg/kg) achieved sustained beta-blockade in rats. In the main study, following left coronary ligation, 36 rats received atenolol and 18 rats received placebo daily for 7 days. Infarct size was similar in treated and control rats (25 +/- 13% versus 28 +/- 11%). Expansion grades and a quantitative index of expansion were similar for both groups. Infarct size and expansion index were significantly related, but linear regression lines were similar for treated and control rats. We conclude that atenolol has no significant effect on infarct expansion in this nonreperfused rat model. \nRubber-specific IgE in children with spina bifida. We attempted to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of rubber-specific IgE in a prospective case control study of 32 preoperative children with spina bifida, compared with 45 outpatient controls and 35 age-matched preoperative controls without spina bifida. A latex-specific radioallergosorbent test was positive in 11 of the 32 spina bifida patients (34%), compared with 1 (2%) and 4 (11%) of the respective controls (p less than 0.05). Within the spina bifida group 5 of 11 antibody-positive patients had a history of rubber-associated, intraoperative or otherwise idiopathic allergic episodes and 1 of 21 antibody-negative patients gave such a history (p = 0.012). Children with spina bifida have a significantly greater likelihood than controls of having IgE specific for rubber antigens. In addition, the presence of rubber-specific IgE is associated with a higher frequency of rubber-associated, intraoperative or idiopathic allergic reactions. \nThrombolytic and pharmacokinetic properties of a conjugate of recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator with a monoclonal antibody specific for cross-linked fibrin in a baboon venous thrombosis model Chemical conjugates between recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA) and a murine monoclonal antibody directed against fragment D-dimer of cross-linked human fibrin (MA-15C5), rscu-PA/MA-15C5, and between rscu-PA and a control monoclonal antibody (MA-1C8), rscu-PA/MA-1C8, were produced by cross-linking with N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP). In an in vitro system composed of a [125 I]fibrin-labeled baboon plasma clot immersed in autologous citrated plasma, dose- and time-dependent lysis was obtained with a ratio of the potencies of free and conjugated rscu-PA similar to that in human plasma: 50% lysis in 2 hours required 4.3 micrograms/ml rscu-PA, 1.0 microgram/ml urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) equivalent rscu-PA/MA-15C5, or 15 micrograms/ml u-PA equivalent rscu-PA/MA-1C8. The thrombolytic and pharmacokinetic properties of rscu-PA and of rscu-PA/MA-15C5 were compared in baboons with a 0.8-1.0 ml [125 I]fibrin-labeled autologous blood clot produced in a femoral vein. Continuous intravenous infusion of these compounds during a 2-hour period resulted in dose- and time-dependent lysis. The thrombolytic potency of rscu-PA/MA-15C5 was 3.0 +/- 0.5 times higher (50% lysis with 0.3 +/- 0.02 mg u-PA equivalent/kg body wt) than that of rscu-PA measured by ex vivo isotope recovery from the femoral vein segment (p less than 0.001) and was 2.7 +/- 0.5 times higher (50% lysis with 0.35 +/- 0.02 mg/kg rscu-PA/MA-15C5) by external radioisotope counting (p less than 0.001). A dose of 0.5 mg/kg of rscu-PA/MA-1C8 was much less active than rscu-PA. After the end of the infusion, u-PA-related antigen disappeared from plasma in a biphasic manner with an initial half-time of 2.7 +/- 0.5 for rscu-PA, 24 +/- 1.2 for rscu-PA/MA-15C5, and 21 +/- 0.5 minutes for rscu-PA/MA-1C8 with corresponding plasma clearances of 340 +/- 40, 20 +/- 3, and 24 +/- 2 ml/min, respectively. In conclusion, the increased thrombolytic potency of rscu-PA/MA-15C5 is the result of a reduction of the thrombolytic potency due to coupling of rscu-PA to the antibody molecule, which is counter-balanced by an enhancement of the thrombolytic potency due to fibrin targeting by the specific idiotype. \nEffect of acute hypoxia on respiration and brain stem blood flow in the piglet. Changes in local brain stem perfusion that alter extracellular fluid Pco2 and/or [H+] near central chemoreceptors may contribute to the decrease in respiration observed during hypoxia after peripheral chemoreceptor denervation and to the delayed decrease observed during hypoxia in the newborn. In this study, we measured the changes in respiration and brain stem blood flow (BBF) during 2-4 min of hypoxic hypoxia in both intact and denervated piglets and calculated the changes in brain stem Pco2 and [H+] that would be expected to occur as a result of the changes in BBF. All animals were anesthetized, spontaneously breathing, and between 2 and 7 days of age. Respiratory and other variables were measured before and during hypoxia in all animals, and BBF (microspheres) was measured in a subgroup of intact and denervated animals at 0, 30, and 260 s and at 0 and 80 s, respectively. During hypoxia, minute ventilation increased and then decreased (biphasic response) in the intact animals but decreased only in the denervated animals. BBF increased in a near linear fashion, and calculated brain stem extracellular fluid Pco2 and [H+] decreased over the first 80 s both before and after denervation. We speculate that a rapid increase in BBF during acute hypoxia decreases brain stem extracellular fluid Pco2 and [H+], which, in turn, negatively modulate the increase in respiratory drive produced by peripheral chemoreceptor input to the central respiratory generator. \nEmbolic abscesses in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherited disorder in which patients may have multiple telangiectases and arteriovenous fistulas in the skin and internal organs. Patients can suffer from a variety of serious clinical complications, including abscess formation. We report two patients in whom neurologic symptoms developed from embolic abscesses, one for whom this complication was fatal. The reported incidence and microbiologic features of this complication are similar to that of endocarditis in patients with valvular heart disease. We believe that patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should receive similar antibacterial prophylaxis for procedures placing them at risk for bacteremia. \nTumor necrosis factor (cachectin) in human visceral leishmaniasis. High tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) levels were present in the serum of 24 of 28 active visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients (142.9 +/- 113.9 pg/ml, mean +/- SD), whereas levels were not elevated in 26 of 30 patients with cryptic leishmanial infection (16 asymptomatic, 4 with self-healing subclinical infection, and 10 posttreatment VL cases). Serum TNF alpha levels were also not elevated in 15 normal volunteers (11.3 +/- 15.6 pg/ml) and in 10 patients with tegumentary leishmaniasis (19.1 +/- 10.8 pg/ml). Leishmanial infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages enhanced the basal TNF alpha production by these cells, and this effect was further potentiated by treatment with recombinant interferon-gamma. After effective treatment of VL patients, serum TNF alpha levels dropped rapidly (129 +/- 112 vs. 9 +/- 13 pg/ml in 10 days), even before clinical parameters such as spleen size or parasitism, white blood cell count, or levels of hemoglobin returned to normal values. On the other hand, patients unresponsive to treatment remained with elevated levels (276 +/- 69 vs. 155 +/- 71 pg/ml in 10 days). Thus, serum TNF alpha levels in VL patients are a good parameter to monitor in determining host response to therapy. \nIntracranial arteriovenous fistula manifesting as progressive neurological deterioration in an infant: case report. This 1-year-old male infant had been diagnosed with cerebral degenerative disease because he developed psychomotor regression, and brain atrophy was demonstrated on computed tomography. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which suggested a cerebrovascular malformation. Cerebral angiography disclosed an arteriovenous fistula, fed by an anterior cerebral artery and directly draining into a cortical vein. The occlusion of the feeding artery was followed by a satisfactory recovery. The mechanism of the neurological symptoms in this patient is thought to be caused by a steal phenomenon and compression of the brain stem by venous engorgement in the posterior fossa. \nUse of the Souter-Strathclyde total elbow prosthesis in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis. Thirty-three patients had thirty-four consecutive primary arthroplasties, with use of the Souter-Strathclyde cemented unconstrained prosthesis, for severe rheumatoid arthritis of the elbow. The minimum duration of follow-up for inclusion in the study was two years. Three patients died. Four arthroplasties were revised: three, because of irreducible dislocation immediately after the operation and one, because of loosening without infection. One prosthesis was removed because of a late deep infection. In most of the remaining twenty-five patients (twenty-six arthroplasties), who had an average duration of follow-up of four years (range, two to eight years), pain was markedly less or had resolved completely, and the function of the elbow was greatly improved. \nUtility of a transdermal delivery system for antihypertensive therapy. Part 1. A retrospective evaluation of patient-level Medicaid claims data from two states was undertaken to discern the fiscal utility of transdermally delivered clonidine versus both the oral formulation of clonidine and oral formulations of eight other antihypertensive agents. In the first phase of our two-part study, we compared paid claims data (n = 1,135) from Florida for transdermal and oral clonidine. Multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate the incremental impact of six variables on health-care expenditures in the first year after patients were given a diagnosis of hypertension. These variables were: age, gender, prior utilization of medical services, regimen complexity, and dosage formulation. Patients prescribed transdermal clonidine experienced a significant (p less than or equal to 0.001) increase in prescription expenditures and significant reductions in the use of physician (p less than or equal to 0.05), laboratory (p less than or equal to 0.10), and hospital (p less than or equal to 0.05) services. Moreover, savings were maximized (p less than or equal to 0.001) where multi-drug regimens incorporated the transdermal delivery system. In the second phase of our study we compared paid claims data (n = 8,894) from South Carolina for transdermal clonidine and for nine oral antihypertensive agents: atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, enalapril, metoprolol, prazosin, terazosin, and verapamil-SR. Once again, regression analysis was used, this time to evaluate the incremental impact of five variables on health-care expenditures in the first year post diagnosis: age, gender, prior utilization of medical services, regimen complexity, and Medication Possession Ratio (MPR), an index of compliance. The data from part 2 of our study revealed that patients assigned a b.i.d. oral antihypertensive agent experienced a significant reduction (p less than or equal to 0.05) in MPR and a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in health-care expenditures when compared to patients prescribed the transdermal delivery system and to patients prescribed once-daily oral medications. These data confirm previous findings concerning the impact of complicated dosing regimens on compliance in hypertensive patients. In this two-part paper we report the data from both phases of our study. \nThe role of intraluminal radiotherapy and concurrent 5-fluorouracil infusion in the management of carcinoma esophagus: a pilot study. Fifty patients with carcinoma of the esophagus were entered in a randomized pilot study to test the efficacy of intraluminal radiotherapy (ILRT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion. The median age was 65 years, with 80% having middle third lesions; in 62%, the lesions were longer than 5 cm. After external beam therapy of 50 Gy in 5 weeks, patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy. Significant improvement in dysphagia was recorded in 76% patients with complete response in 47 cases ranging from 6 to 27 months. The overall survival at 2 years was 15% with ILRT alone versus 22% with ILRT plus 5-FU infusion. \nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of experimental liver cancer. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) was used to treat Morris rat hepatoma 3924A implanted in the liver. Treatment was administered with a lens-focused 4-MHz transducer that created a focused beam of 550 W/cm2 at peak intensity. One hundred twelve rats with liver tumors were divided into two groups of 56 each. Group 1 received HIFU therapy while group 2 (the control group) did not. All rats were killed immediately or 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days after treatment. Eight rats in each group were killed at each interval for pathologic and biochemical studies. Significant inhibition of the tumor growth was seen in the HIFU-treated group, with tumor growth inhibition rates of 65.4% to 93.1% from the third to the 28th day after treatment. Ultrasound-treated tumors showed direct thermal cytotoxic necrosis and fibrosis. An additional 56 ACl rats with liver tumors were divided into four groups of 14 each. Group 1 received doxorubicin hydrochloride intraperitoneally and HIFU therapy; group 2, HIFU therapy; group 3, doxorubicin hydrochloride; and group 4 (the control group), neither HIFU nor doxorubicin hydrochloride. Significantly improved survival rates were noted in HIFU-treated animals (groups 1 and 2) compared with those of groups 3 and 4. These data suggest that HIFU may be a useful method for local treatment of hepatic tumors. \nLiver tumor promotion: effect of phenobarbital on EGF and protein kinase C signal transduction and transforming growth factor-beta 1 expression. Phenobarbital (PB) added to the medium of cultured rat hepatocytes alters epidermal growth factor (EGF) dependent mitogenesis in a biphasic manner; PB concentrations less than 1.5 mM are growth stimulatory but higher concentrations significantly inhibit normal hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast, the growth of putative preneoplastic cells is inhibited less by high concentrations of PB. Mechanistic studies designed to test the ability of PB to alter the early events of EGF signal transduction demonstrate that PB neither competes with EGF for binding to the EGF receptor nor alters EGF-induced receptor down-regulation. However, pretreatment with PB (greater than 1 mM) results in a transient inhibition of EGF binding to hepatocytes. The kinetics of this effect are similar to those obtained when hepatocytes are exposed to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a skin tumor promoter and activator of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. However, several observations suggest that distinct mechanisms mediate the responses to these two tumor promoters. First, the inhibitory effects of PB and TPA on EGF binding are additive. Also down-regulation of EGF receptors in response to TPA occurs with hepatocytes, A431 epidermal carcinoma cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and rat liver epithelial cells, but only hepatocytes are sensitive to PB. Furthermore, translocation of protein kinase C to the membrane occurs in hepatocytes treated with TPA but not in those treated with PB. The chronic treatment of rats with PB further sensitizes hepatocytes to EGF receptor down-regulation by in vitro PB while desensitizing them to EGF receptor down-regulation by TPA. This latter effect is correlated with a decreased ability of TPA to induce translocation of protein kinase C to the membrane. PB significantly increases the intracellular concentration of TGF-beta 1 in periportal hepatocytes but not in putative preneoplastic cells. TGF-beta 1 may therefore have an important function in regulating early stages of cell cycle progression in proliferating hepatocytes. \nOtologic sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis: a survey of 164 consecutive cases with a follow-up of 94 survivors. As part of a comprehensive study on sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis, 94 of 111 consecutive survivors were re-examined 4 to 16 years after discharge. Twenty-three patients had otological sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis. In these patients, 17 had hearing losses, 7 had tinnitus, 9 had vertigo, 13 had vestibular areflexia, 4 had loss of smell, and 3 had loss of taste. Among the patients with hearing loss, 4 were bilaterally deaf, 6 were unilaterally deaf, and 2 had mild and 5 had slight hearing losses. From correlations with extensive data from the medical records, preadmission antibiotic treatment appeared to protect from acousticovestibular damage. Purulent otitis media and otosurgical intervention did not correlate to the fatality rate or the development of sequelae. Acute purulent otitis media appeared as a concomitant manifestation, rather than the focus of pneumococcal meningitis. \nLarge cysts of the pineal gland: report of two cases. Two cases of large, nontumorous cysts of the pineal gland are reported, the histopathology of which was confirmed using surgically resected specimens. Both patients were middle-aged, and the pineal cysts were found incidentally. The histopathological findings in the two cases were strikingly similar to each other and were characterized by the following points: 1) the cyst wall typically consisted of three layers, namely, collagenous fibers, glia-like cells, and normal pineal cells; 2) the cyst wall was relatively thin, approximately 100 to 300 microns in thickness; and 3) deposits of calcification almost always existed on the side of the layer of collagenous fiber. Because these findings are clearly different from those previously reported, large benign cysts of the pineal gland, or at least some of them, may constitute a new pathological entity. It is important to consider this possible pathological diagnosis when dealing with pineal cysts. \nValue of ultrasound in differentiating causes of persistent vomiting in infants. A prospective study of abdominal ultrasound was undertaken in 100 consecutive infants who presented with a history of persistent vomiting aged 5 to 90 days. Each infant had a 'test feed' followed by an ultrasonographic scan of the pylorus at the cotside. On test feeding a palpable tumour was evident in 38 infants. On real time ultrasound using the criteria for diagnosing pyloric stenosis, these 38 infants as well as six others were documented as having pyloric stenosis. In the other 56 patients the vomiting settled in six and a barium examination was performed on the remaining 50. This confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux in 46, two of whom had an associated hiatus hernia, one with a duodenal malrotation, and three were reported as normal. Ultrasound of the abdomen is an accurate, reliable, and rapid screening method to differentiate the causes of severe vomiting in infancy. \nUse of intravenous immunoglobulin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A brief review. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disorder with multiple defects leading to an increased susceptibility to infection. Hypogammaglobulinemia is present in about 20% to 70% of patients with CLL. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) supplementation (400 mg/kg body weight every 3 weeks) prevented bacterial infections in these patients. An ongoing study is being conducted to compare doses of 250 mg/kg/mo with those of 500 mg/kg/mo in 36 patients included so far. As of this writing, the rate of infection in the two treatment groups was not significantly different, and no substantial loss of protection against bacterial infection was found in the lower-dose group. It seems likely that the lower dose is almost as effective as the standard therapy. If this is so, cost savings would be substantial. \nThe role of the pathologist in the management of breast cancer. The pathologist is a consultant in breast cancer management whose responsibility is to establish the histologic diagnosis of cancer as well as its anatomic extent once sufficient tissue has been provided. The consultation also provides data that may be used to aid in selecting primary or adjuvant therapy, evaluating new therapies, estimating prognosis, and assessing outcome. Examples of such data are the TNM histopathologic classification of the anatomic extent of the cancer used for the stage grouping (T = the extent of the primary tumor, N = the absence or presence and extent of regional lymph node metastasis, and M = the absence or presence of distant metastasis); tumor size, histologic type, and histologic and/or nuclear grade; assessment of blood vessel and lymphatic vessel invasion; analysis of steroid receptors, and other special studies as appropriate. \nPerinatal mycoplasmal infections. Maternal infections are known to play a major role in perinatal morbidity and mortality. Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis are sexually transmissible microorganisms associated with a number of pathologic conditions in the pregnant woman including chorioamnionitis and postpartum fever. They are rapidly gaining recognition as significant causes of perinatal infection, especially in infants born prematurely. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, pathology, disease spectrum, and clinical manifestations of mycoplasmal and ureaplasmal perinatal infections and presents guidelines for proper diagnosis and treatment. \nDying of cancer: a patient's recollection of her illness and of her doctors. A personal account of a patient's long ordeal with cancer of the tongue is presented. The explicit journal begins at the time that a lesion was first detected and ends approximately 4 1/2 years later, just 8 1/2 months before the patient's death from local disease. Important principles of clinical diagnosis and patient management, vividly underscored by this case, are reviewed and discussed. \nLiver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and hepatic neoplasms. In closing, it is important to note that the indications for liver transplantation are not static but rather are remarkably dynamic and capable of change over time. Thus yesterday's major indications can become relative contraindications, while yesterday's absolute contraindications have become today's nuisances. The goal for physicians who care for individuals with problems such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and hepatic cancer should be to develop new strategies of care that will ultimately eliminate these diseases as problems, rather than eliminating individuals with such health problems from currently available health options. In other words, physicians who accept the responsibility for a patient's life should be searching for the best form of therapy available for their patient rather than examining the reasons that exist for limiting one's choice in health care. \nChorea-acanthocytosis: abnormal composition of covalently bound fatty acids of erythrocyte membrane proteins. Phospholipid class, peak profile of each phospholipid class, loosely bound fatty acids, covalently (tightly) bound fatty acids of the erythrocyte membranes, and plasma fatty acids were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography in six patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and 14 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects. Additionally, six patients with Huntington's disease were included as disease control subjects in the study of covalently bound fatty acids. Study of covalently (tightly) bound fatty acids in erythrocyte membrane proteins after alkaline hydrolysis, hitherto undescribed in chorea-acanthocytosis, revealed that palmitic acid (C16:0) was significantly increased and stearic acid (C18:0) was decreased in the patients with chorea-acanthocytosis. Analyses for total covalently bound fatty acids disclosed that palmitic and docosahexaenoic (C22:6) acids were increased and stearic acid was decreased in chorea-acanthocytosis. Phospholipid class (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylserine) and peak profile of each phospholipid class from the erythrocyte membranes did not differ between the patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and the control subjects. Of the loosely bound fatty acids, linoleic acid (C18:2) was significantly decreased in those with chorea-acanthocytosis, which seemed to be nonspecific. \nObservations on massive retrieved human allografts. Radiographic and histological studies of sixteen massive retrieved human allografts were carried out after the allografts had been in situ for four to sixty-five months. The studies demonstrated that union between the allograft and the host took place slowly at cortical-cortical junctions by the formation of an external callus derived from the cortex of the host, and it took place more rapidly at cancellous-cancellous junctions by internal callus advancing from the host into the allograft. Internal repair took place very slowly, was confined to the superficial surface and the ends of the graft, and had involved only 20 per cent of the graft by five years. The deep unrepaired portions of the graft retained their architecture, and where bone cement had been used to fix a prosthetic stem or an intramedullary rod to the allograft, there was no evidence of resorption of bone or loosening of the device. Soft tissues of the host became attached to the graft by deposition of a thin seam of new bone on the surface of the graft. A previous fracture of two grafts had healed before the time of retrieval. Analysis of the articular cartilage revealed no evidence that any chondrocytes had survived, even when the graft had been cryoprotected before it was preserved by freezing. The necrotic cartilage functioned well for as long as five years, and as it degenerated, it was covered by a pannus of fibrovascular reparative tissue. Two allografts that had been removed because of rejection were surrounded by an envelope of chronic inflammatory tissue that prevented union, adherence of soft tissue, and internal repair. Internal repair was more advanced about sites of fracture and adjacent to recurrent tumors than in other portions of the graft. These findings suggest that large frozen allografts in humans are osteoconductive rather than osteoinductive. \nImproved speed and accuracy of calculations with a programmable calculator in pediatric emergency scenarios. Both mathematical and selection errors may occur when ordering drug or fluid therapy in a busy emergency department. In an attempt to improve the speed and accuracy of such calculations, we programmed a hand-held calculator to assist in drug and intravenous fluid therapy dosages and rates for three emergency situations: diabetic ketoacidosis, asthma, and asystole. Performance by 58 subjects at various levels of training was compared when using either the programmable calculator or standard materials and methods. When standard methods were used, an average of 30.6 minutes was needed to complete the three scenarios, with an accuracy of 73%; by contrast, use of programmable calculator resulted in a significant decline in time needed to calculate doses (an average of only 8.5 minutes), with an improved accuracy of 98%. The use of a programmable calculator can result in a significant improvement in both speed and accuracy of drug and fluid selection and dosage and rate calculations, regardless of the level of the subject's medical training. \nAntiarrhythmic actions of tocainide in canine models of previous myocardial infarction. The antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory efficacies of the class IB antiarrhythmic agent tocainide were characterized in conscious dogs in the early subacute phase of anterior myocardial infarction (48 hours after infarction) and in anesthetized dogs with ventricular tachyarrhythmias that were inducible by programmed stimulation more chronically (10.8 +/- 1.0 days) after anterior myocardial infarction. The frequency of spontaneous premature ventricular complexes in the early subacute postinfarction phase was reduced significantly from 48.4% +/- 10.5% to 8.2% +/- 5.0% of total complexes (p less than 0.01) by the cumulative intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg tocainide. In the late postinfarction setting, the intravenous administration of tocainide (6 mg/kg intravenous loading dose + 100 micrograms/kg/min intravenous maintenance infusion) suppressed the initiation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias by programmed stimulation in 5 of 12 animals that were tested and slowed the rate of tachycardia in 3 additional animals. However, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and of the total number of arrhythmia-related deaths that resulted from the occurrence of a secondary ischemic insult in the presence of previous infarction did not differ significantly between tocainide (75% [9 of 12] incidence of both ventricular fibrillation and of total number of arrhythmia-related deaths) and saline-vehicle control groups (80% [12 of 15] incidence of ventricular fibrillation; 93.3% [14 of 15] incidence of total number of arrhythmia-related deaths). These findings suggest that although class I agents such as tocainide may be efficacious in the suppression of spontaneous premature ventricular complexes and ventricular arrhythmias immediately after myocardial infarction, they may be of limited value in the prevention of malignant ischemic arrhythmias that occur later after myocardial infarction. \nColonic fermentation of dietary fibre to short chain fatty acids in patients with adenomatous polyps and colonic cancer. Short chain (C2-C6) fatty acids are produced in the colon through bacterial fermentation of mainly dietary fibre. Butyrate (C4) possesses antineoplastic effects on human colon carcinoma cells, and epidemiological studies indicate that high fibre diets may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. The role of dietary fibre during colorectal carcinogenesis might therefore be related to its fermentation to butyrate. Faecal concentrations of total short chain fatty acids and concentrations and ratios of the individual C2-C6 fatty acids did not differ between 16 healthy controls, 17 patients with colonic adenomas, and 17 patients with colonic cancer. Comparison of the molar production velocities (mmol/l.hour) of total and individual short chain fatty acids from glucose, ispagula, wheat bran, and albumin in six and 24 hour faecal incubations showed no differences. The ratio of butyrate production to total short chain fatty acid production from fibre, however, was reduced in patients with colonic cancer and adenomas compared with healthy controls (ispagula, six hours: 6.4, 7.6, and 11.5% respectively, p = 0.005 and 24 hour: 9.1, 9.9, and 15.4%, p = 0.002; wheat bran, six hours: 9.9, 10.2, and 14.7% respectively, p = 0.06 and 24 hours: 15.1, 16.8, and 21.0%, p = 0.01). It may be that the low ratios of colonic butyrate formation combined with low fibre diets increase the risk of colonic neoplasia. \nLeft ventricular function and wall thickness in long-term insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: an echocardiographic study. Left ventricular function and wall thickness were evaluated in 111 type I diabetic subjects (mean age 25.5 +/- 9 years, mean duration of diabetes 13.4 +/- 6.2 years), using 2-D-derived M-mode echocardiography. Patients were carefully selected for the absence of major coronary risk factors or manifest cardiac disorders, and compared with 91 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Fractional shortening and the maximal velocity of cirumferential fibre shortening did not differ significantly between the two groups. Furthermore, no differences were found in the diastolic functional parameter of velocity of circumferential fibre extension. Posterior wall thickness was significantly increased in the diabetic patients compared to the controls (9.5 +/- 1.8 mm vs. 8.4 +/- 1.3 mm. P less than 0.01). As the thickness of the interventricular septum was also moderately increased (9.2 +/- 2.2 mm vs. 8.9 +/- 1.7 mm, NS), these findings provide evidence for an early structural change of the myocardium in young diabetic patients without clinically relevant functional consequences. \nHuman high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen mimicry by mouse antiidiotypic monoclonal antibody MK2-23. Characterization of the immunogenicity in syngeneic hosts. Previous studies have shown that the mouse antiidiotypic mAb MK2-23 elicited with the syngeneic anti-human high molecular weight melanoma-associated Ag (HMW-MAA) mAb 763.74 elicits anti-HMW-MAA antibodies in syngeneic hosts and in patients with melanoma. The present investigation has characterized the fine specificity of antibodies elicited by mAb MK2-23, tested its ability to induce delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to HMW-MAA-bearing melanoma cells and analyzed the variables that influence the immunogenicity of mAb MK2-23. The anti-HMW-MAA antibodies elicited by mAb MK2-23 recognize the same population of molecules recognized by mAb 763.74, react with the same (or spatially close) determinant(s) and express the idiotopes recognized by mAb MK2-23 in their Ag-combining sites. The antiidiotypic antibodies that bind to HMW-MAA have a lower titer than those that do not. These results in conjunction with those obtained in mice using a suboptimal immunization schedule suggest that the idiotope(s) that mimic(s) the mAb 763.74-defined determinant of the HMW-MAA is less immunogenic than those that do not. mAb MK2-23 induces a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to HMW-MAA-bearing melanoma cells. Therefore, mAb MK2-23 represents the first example of mouse antiidiotypic mAb that induces a cellular and humoral immunity to a human tumor-associated Ag (TAA), because the previously described mouse antiidiotypic mAb that bear the mirror image of TAA have been shown to induce only humoral anti-TAA immunity. The immunogenicity of mAb MK2-23 is markedly enhanced by its conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and its administration with FA. Furthermore, the number of immunizations and the doses of mAb MK2-23 injected influence its immunogenicity, although to a lower extent than conjugation to a carrier and mixing with an adjuvant. The information derived from the present investigation represents a useful background to optimize the immunization schedule with mAb MK2-23 in patients with melanoma. \nPatterns of postictal cerebral blood flow in temporal lobe epilepsy: qualitative and quantitative analysis. We used single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to study postictal cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 51 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. There were 78 seizures studied, 77 by early postictal injection of Tc-99m HMPAO (delay from seizure onset = 4.3 +/- 4.5 min) and one by ictal injection. Increased focal temporal lobe uptake, predominantly confined to the anteromesial region, was present in 83% and declined rapidly over 5 minutes. Reduced activity in the lateral temporal lobe accompanied the mesial increase in 80% of studies, extending over much of the ipsilateral hemisphere and closely associated with the degree and extent of postictal EEG slow waves. These patterns enabled correct seizure localization by blinded analysis in 69% (31/45) of the patients with a unilateral EEG focus. The remainder showed bilateral or no changes. One of six patients with bitemporal EEG foci had unilateral perfusion changes. The positive predictive value for the correct localization of a unilateral focus by postictal SPECT was 97% (31/32). Postictal CBF imaging with SPECT can be used to support noninvasive electrographic localization and may decrease the need for invasive electrode studies. \nSerum-erythropoietin concentration during acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Reduced oxygen tension is regarded as the primary physiologic signal for the production of erythropoietin (EPO). There is little information available about early changes of EPO production in man due to severe hypoxia. The purpose of the present study was to examine the time course of EPO in serum of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE). In 29 patients (seventy-five +/- six years, mean age +/- SEM) who were hospitalized within two hours after onset of symptoms of ACPE, serum EPO concentrations were monitored for up to seventy-two hours. At the moment of admission all patients showed significantly increased EPO concentrations of 121 +/- 64 mU/mL (mean +/- SEM) compared with a healthy population (15-35 mU/mL). Twenty-three patients who recovered within thirty minutes (group A) exhibited a quick return of their EPO serum levels to normal. The remaining 6 patients (group B) had a protracted clinical course and their EPO concentration showed a further increase up to the end of the observation period. The comparative monitoring of concentrations of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin III, C-reactive protein, fibronectin, hapotoglobin, and transerrin in serum and plasma revealed no significant changes. Thus a major contribution of fluid shifts into or from the intravascular compartment to the observed changes in EPO concentration seems to be unlikely. The data suggest that the production and release of EPO in the kidneys due to altered oxygen delivery is a fast-responding mechanism. \nCoronary angioplasty using new 6 French guiding catheters. Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was performed with specially constructed 6-French guiding catheters with an internal lumen of 0.051 inches. In 154 patients these guiding catheters were used in a variety of configurations in conjunction with miniature balloon-on-a-wire dilatation catheters in 1.5 to 3.5 mm sizes to perform PTCA. Overall patient success was 94%. PTCA was attempted in 24 totally occluded arteries with a success rate of 83% and 174 stenoses with a success rate of 97%. 6 French guiding catheters can be used to successfully perform PTCA. \nValidity of diurnal sleep recording in the diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome. Two polysomnographic studies were performed in 35 subjects who had a clinical suspicion of sleep apnea syndrome: one study was done at night (N) (from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.) and the other during the day (D) starting after lunch (from noon to 5:00 p.m.). N and D sleep studies were performed in random order at a minimal interval of 36 h. No treatment (drug, CPAP) was initiated between the two studies. Both studies included the recording of sleep stages (EEG, EOG, EMG), nasal and mouth flows, thoracoabdominal movements, electrocardiogram, and SaO2 (ear oximetry). D sleep was present in all but one subject. As expected, the total sleep time (TST) was significantly shorter during the D than during the N study (2.6 +/- 0.2 and 6.2 +/- 0.2 h, respectively, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test). Stages III-IV and REM were significantly less represented during the D (13.1 +/- 2.4 and 7.7 +/- 1.3%, respectively) than during the N study (18.5 +/- 1.7 and 15.3 +/- 0.8%, p less than or equal to 0.005). From the results of the N study, the diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome (apnea index greater than 5 and/or apnea + hypopnea index greater than 10) was made in 25 patients, and it was confirmed by the same criteria in 22 by the D sleep recording. There was a significant correlation between the N and D values for these indices (r greater than or equal to 0.9, p less than 0.0001). \nRole of sinus node artery disease in sick sinus syndrome in inferior wall acute myocardial infarction. This study was undertaken to evaluate a possible role of sinus node (SN) artery disease in the pathogenesis of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) in patients with an inferior wall acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Coronary angiography and electrophysiologic studies of the SN, both in the basal state and after pharmacologic autonomic blockade, were performed in 23 study patients (mean age 60 years) with SSS and a previous inferior wall AMI and in another 23 control patients (mean age 57 years) with normal sinus rate and a previous inferior AMI. Stenosis of the SN artery (or that proximal to its origin) greater than 50% was present in 13 study patients (56%) and in 8 control patients (34%) (p less than 0.05). In the study group, the intrinsic heart rate was abnormal in 5 of the 6 patients (83%) with severe SN artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 75% narrowing), in 3 of the 7 (43%) with moderate stenosis (50 to 75% narrowing) and in 3 of the 10 (30%) with insignificant stenosis (less than 50% narrowing). In the study group, the correlation between the SN measures (heart rate, corrected SN recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time) and the severity of SN artery stenosis was good after autonomic blockade (r between 0.59 and 0.64) and poor in the basal state. These data provide evidence for a role of SN artery disease in the pathogenesis of SSS in patients with an inferior wall AMI. \nPeripheral neuropathy in cold agglutinin disease. Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) characteristically presents as anemia and cold-induced rash. We report a man with purpura, anemia, cold agglutinins, and a sensory-autonomic polyneuropathy. Treatment with corticosteroids and plasma exchange resulted in resolution of the anemia and polyneuropathy. We propose that CAD may be associated with a reversible sensory-autonomic neuropathy in the absence of cryoglobulinemia. Although unsupported by pathologic findings, pathogenetic hypotheses for the neuropathy in CAD are similar to those proposed for cryoglobulinemic neuropathy. \nInverted papilloma of the nose and paranasal sinuses: a study of 67 patients. Retrospectively, 67 patients with inverted nasal papillomas were studied. In 12, the lesions were localized exclusively on the nasal septum. In 55, the lesion involved the lateral wall and/or the paranasal sinuses. There was a male predominance of 3:1. After histological revision the most dominating epithelial type was found to be transitional. Inverted papilloma was in one patient associated with squamous cell carcinoma. Ten per cent suffered recurrences from 6 to 37 months after the primary surgical procedure. We found that limited septal lesions could be managed by an intranasal procedure but lateral rhinotomy is recommended as the procedure of choice in the treatment of inverted papilloma of the lateral wall. \nInterferon-induced chronic active hepatitis? A 54-year-old man with chronic B hepatitis was treated with interferon alfa. Despite resolution of the hepatitis B viral infection, he experienced severe jaundice, ascites, and encephalopathy. Further work-up showed hyperglobulinemia, chiefly immunoglobulin G, and positive smooth muscle and anti-nuclear antibodies. Because of these \"autoimmune\" features, the patient was treated with prednisone. One month later, a significant clinical and biochemical improvement was observed. A possible autoimmune mechanism induced by interferon alfa is proposed as the cause for the perpetuation of the necroinflammatory activity. \nMicrovascular angina. Cardiovascular investigations regarding pathophysiology and management. A significant minority of patients with chest pain who undergo cardiac catheterization are found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries. Over the past 25 years, several studies have shown that a subset have demonstrable abnormalities in coronary flow and cardiac function; however, only a minority of these patients have convincing evidence for myocardial ischemia during stress, and alternative mechanisms have been explored to explain the frequent and debilitating symptoms of pain experienced by the majority of these patients undergoing study. Abnormal visceral nociception appears to be a fundamental abnormality in this population, whether or not demonstrable abnormalities in coronary flow or cardiac function can be demonstrated. \nNeobladder construction using completely detubularized sigmoid colon after radical cystoprostatectomy. To improve the quality of life of the patient we used completely detubularized sigmoid colon for bladder reconstruction along with radical cystoprostatectomy in 6 men with invasive bladder cancer. Followup was 8 to 20 months. Postoperatively, all of the patients were continent during the day but only 4 (66.7%) were continent at night, although they had to awaken twice to remain dry. Neocystourethroscopy in 4 of the 6 patients revealed no tumor and no stricture at the urethrocolonic anastomosis. However, a stone in the neobladder was found in 1 patients. Urodynamic study of the neobladder showed a low pressure (mean 16.7 cm. water) at the filling phase of water cystometry and an adequate maximal urethral closure pressure (mean 52.0 cm. water) and functional profile length (mean 3.8 cm.). The uroflow rate in all patients was good (1 patient even had a maximal uroflow rate of 31 ml. per second). There was no reflux in any patient. One patient had intestinal obstruction 5 months postoperatively and died 5 months later of widespread metastasis. The remaining 5 patients are alive with a satisfactory quality of life. In conclusion, use of completely detubularized sigmoid colon may be an ideal operation for neobladder construction after radical cystoprostatectomy. \nHemodynamic and clinical benefits with intravenous milrinone in severe chronic heart failure: results of a multicenter study in the United States. The response of patients with chronic severe heart failure to extended infusions (greater than or equal to 48 hours) of milrinone was evaluated in a multicenter, baseline-controlled, phase III efficacy and safety trial in 189 patients in the United States. Milrinone was given as loading and maintenance infusions according to one of four dose regimens. An effective response was defined as greater than or equal to 20% increases in cardiac index or decreases in pulmonary wedge pressure. All loading doses (range, 37.5 to 75 micrograms/kg/10 min) were effective short term, and maximum response occurred at 15 minutes. For the three effective regimens, cardiac index increased initially (at 15 minutes) by 24% to 42%, and pulmonary wedge pressure decreased by 24% to 33%. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by 15% to 31%. The maximal acute response was effective in 99% of individual patients. During maintenance therapy, effective responses were seen at infusion doses of 0.375, 0.50, and 0.75 micrograms/kg/min, whereas an infusion of 0.25 micrograms/kg/min was ineffective. During 2 days of maintenance therapy, cardiac index remained augmented by 34% to 39% for the low and intermediate doses and by 44% to 73% for the high-dose infusion regimen. Pulmonary wedge pressure decreased an average of 18% on day 1 and 30% on day 2. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by 20% to 25%, and stroke work index was augmented by 21% to 58%. Symptomatic improvement was common during intravenous milrinone therapy for symptoms of dyspnea (61% response), orthopnea (63%), edema (62%), and fatigue (40%). Improvement occurred more frequently in those with worse baseline functional indexes and in those with greater hemodynamic responses to therapy. Safety and tolerance were exceptionally good for these patients with advanced heart failure. \nIndicators of prognosis after hepatic resection for colorectal secondaries. From 1960 to 1988, 266 patients underwent resection of colorectal secondaries to the liver with curative intent. All patients were followed until April 1, 1990, or death, with a median follow-up time of 52 months. Nine patients with minimal macroscopic residual disease and 38 patients with all gross tumor removed but positive margins showed a poor prognosis with a median survival time of 13.3 months, the longest being 42 months. Of the 219 patients having potentially curative resection, 12 patients died postoperatively (5.5%). Actuarial 5, 10 and 20-year survival for the remaining 207 patients was 39%, 28%, and 18%, respectively. At April 1, 1990, 77 patients were alive with no evidence of disease for up to 24 years, and 12 patients had died without recurrence. The following factors were associated with less favorable crude survival: presence and extent of mesenteric lymph node involvement (p = 0.0003), grade III/IV primary tumor (p = 0.035), synchronous diagnosis of metastases (p = 0.017), satellite metastases (p = 0.0003), limited resection margins (p = 0.019), and nonanatomic procedures (p = 0.013). With respect to disease-free survival, grading of the primary (p = 0.055) and the extent of clear margins (p = 0.019) failed to achieve statistical significance. Two other criteria are commonly recommended as absolute contraindications to hepatic resection: extrahepatic disease and the presence of four or more independent metastases. A radical excision of all detectable disease may rarely be possible in these circumstances. Nevertheless, within the curative settings, no significant predictive value regarding either overall or disease-free survival was found in this series. Three corresponding \"high risk\" patients are alive without disease at 5 to 11 years from hepatic resection. These patients with more advanced intrahepatic or concomitant limited extrahepatic disease require a particularly thorough diagnostic work up. As no superior therapeutic alternative is currently available, an aggressive surgical approach may occasionally be justified, and may, in a small portion, result in definite tumor control. \nDysplasia epiphysealis capitis femoris. Meyer's dysplasia. We made a prospective longitudinal clinical and radiological study of 18 children diagnosed as having dysplasia epiphysealis capitis femoris. Half the cases were bilateral. Boys were affected five times more often than girls. There were no symptoms or clinical signs in most but some of the bilateral cases had an inconsistent waddling gait. The imaging studies suggest that the cartilaginous proximal femoral epiphysis is hypoplastic, with delayed appearance of single or multiple ossification centres. Progressive improvement occurred and at an average age of five years and six months, there was complete fusion of all the ossific nuclei and normal density and texture of the epiphyseal bone. The end result was a round epiphysis with a slightly diminished height. The dysplasia is attributed to focal hypoplasia of the proximal femoral epiphysis. \nCardiovascular disease, motor-vehicle-related injury, and use of clinical preventive services--behavioral risk factor surveillance system, 1989. CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a state-based method for risk factor surveillance, was implemented in 1984. By 1989, 39 states and the District of Columbia participated in monthly random-digit-dialed telephone interviews of adults greater than or equal to 18 years of age (1). A total of 66,867 interviews were conducted in 1989; state-specific sample sizes ranged from 1171 to 3415 (mean: 1672). This report summarizes results of the 1989 survey and compares them with 1988 for risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, motor-vehicle-related injury, and use of clinical preventive services. \nPlatelet-activating effect of low-density lipoprotein and its reversal by isradipine. The effect of the calcium antagonist isradipine on platelet aggregation (induced ex vivo by serotonin and low-density lipoprotein [LDL]) was studied in 17 nonsmoking patients with essential hypertension. Platelet aggregation was measured after a four-week placebo period, and after four and 12 weeks of treatment with isradipine. Both the serotonin-induced and the LDL plus serotonin-induced platelet aggregation were significantly decreased after four weeks of isradipine treatment compared with placebo. The amplifying effect of LDL on the serotonin-induced aggregation was significant both after placebo and after active treatment with isradipine. A further decrease in platelet aggregation induced by LDL plus serotonin was observed after 12 weeks of isradipine treatment so that no amplification of serotonin-induced aggregation by LDL could be detected. In conclusion, it appears that treatment with isradipine restores the impaired platelet response to serotonin and LDL in hypertensive patients. The inhibition of this response may represent a cellular mechanism of thrombovascular protection. \nTreatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by chlorine exposure [published erratum appears in Pediatr Emerg Care 1991 Jun;7(3):151] Chlorine inhalation may rapidly cause pulmonary edema, leading to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We report a 12 year old with acute respiratory failure from inhalation injury after he accidentally dropped chlorine tablets into a swimming pool. Supplemental oxygen alone failed to provide adequate arterial oxygenation. We administered positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the emergency department, resulting in markedly improved oxygenation. Early institution of PEEP should be considered in patients with chlorine poisoning when supplemental oxygen alone is insufficient. \nAbnormally high level of C4b binding protein and deficiency of free fraction of protein S in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and recurrent thromboses. A patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and numerous thrombotic accidents was found to have a deficiency of the free fraction of protein S, most likely due to an abnormally high level of C4b binding protein. These abnormalities, unique in comparison to 4 other patients with hypercoagulation states, were partially corrected with cyclophosphamide. There was no evidence of a consumption of complement components. The interactions between the hemostasis system and the complement cascade are discussed. \nBinding of the adenovirus VAI RNA to the interferon-induced 68-kDa protein kinase correlates with function. In human cells infected with adenovirus, the virus-associated RNA VAI blocks the activation of the interferon-induced double-stranded-RNA-dependent 68-kDa protein kinase (p68) and maintains normal levels of protein synthesis at late times after infection. VAI antagonizes the kinase activity by binding to p68. The structure of VAI consists of two long, base-paired stems connected by a complex short stem-loop structure. Previous work using a series of adenovirus mutants showed that the structural determinants of the VAI RNA that are essential for function reside in the central complex short stem-loop structure and adjacent base-paired regions (functional domain); the long duplex regions were found to be dispensable for function. To determine whether binding of VAI to p68 correlates with function and whether the structural determinants that are essential for function are also essential for binding, we studied the interaction of wild-type and several mutant VAI RNAs with p68 in whole cells. The p68-VAI complexes from mutant- and wild-type-infected cells were immunoprecipitated by an anti-p68 monoclonal antibody. The mutant RNAs that functioned efficiently in the cells bound to p68 efficiently in the cells, whereas functionally impaired mutants failed to bind to p68, indicating that the binding of the VAI RNA to p68 correlates well with function. In vitro binding assays with immunopurified p68 confirmed these observations. Secondary-structure analysis of several mutant VAI RNAs suggests that the binding does not depend on the long duplex regions but requires all the elements of the functional domain. We propose that the functional domain and the p68-binding domain of the VAI RNA are identical. \nInsulin action and metabolism in patients with head and neck cancer. Cachexia is a phenomenon commonly observed in patients with cancer, but its etiology is poorly understood. Abnormalities of insulin action and metabolism that have been hypothesized to promote cancer cachexia were investigated in this study using a computerized euglycemic clamp and modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) in a group of malnourished patients with localized head and neck cancer, and in healthy, well-nourished, age- and, sex-matched controls. Glucose disposal rates, determined by the euglycemic clamp at three different rates of insulin infusion did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, mean plasma insulin concentrations at each level of insulin infused were significantly lower in the patients with cancer than in the control subjects resulting in unexpectedly higher calculated insulin metabolic clearance rate in the patients with cancer. Peripheral insulin sensitivity calculated from the slope of glucose disposal versus plasma insulin concentration did not differ between the two groups. Results from the FSIGT demonstrated no difference in insulin sensitivity or insulin-independent glucose disappearance between the two groups. However, whole body glucose appearance was significantly elevated in the patients with cancer. Thus, increased whole body glucose utilization in the absence of insulin resistance or increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal was observed. These data are consistent with the concept of a localized tumor acting as a glucose drain in which case increased glucose appearance and increased insulin clearance would defend against hypoglycemia. \nFocal myositis, a benign inflammatory pseudotumour: CT appearances. Focal myositis is a rare benign pseudotumour of skeletal muscle, of unknown cause. Clinically it presents as an enlarging mass within muscle, usually of an extremity, and is often mistaken for a soft tissue neoplasm. The diagnosis is made by biopsy which reveals characteristic histological changes of inflammation, focal degeneration and regeneration, and some evidence of denervation. The CT findings include irregularity and enlargement of the muscles involved, with diffuse, poorly defined fatty infiltration of the muscle planes, but no evidence of an associated mass. We present two cases of focal myositis of the calf, both of which mimicked a soft tissue neoplasm, and in which CT was helpful in determining the nature and extent of the abnormality, for needle biopsy, and follow-up. \nRole of radiation after operative palliation in cancer of the proximal bile ducts. Cancer of the proximal bile ducts continues to pose a formidable problem to even the most experienced biliary surgeon. From 1977 through 1985, 51 patients with histologically confirmed proximal bile duct cancers underwent surgical treatment. The lesion was confined to the hilar region in 30 patients; there was extensive hepatic infiltration or distant metastatic disease in 21 patients. One patient underwent resection. Biopsy only was performed in six patients. In the remaining 44 patients, transtumoral dilation and intubation were performed. These 44 patients were further analyzed with regard to how survival was affected by the presence of metastatic disease and by the adjunctive use of radiation therapy. Mean survival in those patients with metastatic disease (n = 16) was 6.1 months, and survival was not improved by the use of postoperative radiation. In the absence of metastatic or advanced local disease, however, the addition of external beam radiation did significantly extend the mean survival from 4.5 to 12.2 months and the median survival from 2.2 to 12.2 months. The operative mortality for the series was 14% and postoperative complications occurred in 18 patients. These findings suggest that the addition of external beam radiation improves survival in patients undergoing palliative treatment of hilar tumors. Further confirmation of the value of radiation awaits prospective investigation. \nHemodynamic and electrophysiological actions of cocaine. Effects of sodium bicarbonate as an antidote in dogs. BACKGROUND. Cocaine abuse has been implicated as a cause of death due to sudden cardiac arrest. METHODS AND RESULTS. We examined the hemodynamic and electrophysiological effects of cocaine administered as a series of 5-mg/kg i.v. boluses coupled with a continuous infusion in anesthetized dogs. Sodium bicarbonate (50 meq i.v.) was administered as a potential antidote in 11 of 15 dogs, and intravenous 5% dextrose was given in the remaining four. In a dose-dependent fashion, cocaine significantly decreased blood pressure, coronary blood flow, and cardiac output; increased PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals and sinus cycle length; and increased ventricular effective refractory period and dispersion of ventricular refractoriness. No afterdepolarizations were noted in the monophasic action potential recording. Nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia occurred spontaneously in two dogs, and sustained ventricular tachycardia could be induced by programmed stimulation at the end of the dosing protocol in five of 11 animals. Sodium bicarbonate promptly decreased cocaine-induced QRS prolongation to nearly that measured at baseline but had no effect on the other electrocardiographic or hemodynamic variables. In one dog, sodium bicarbonate administration was associated with reversion of ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that high-dose cocaine possesses negative inotropic and potent type I electrophysiological effects. Sodium bicarbonate selectively reversed cocaine-induced QRS prolongation and may be a useful treatment of ventricular arrhythmias associated with slowed ventricular conduction in the setting of cocaine overdose. \nHospitalisation of prostatic cancer patients undergoing orchiectomy. We report our experience with 100 orchiectomies for advanced prostatic cancer in hospitalised patients. Approximately 60% of the patients required hospitalisation for additional treatment and investigation of complications due to their disease at the time of orchiectomy. In 51 cases the orchiectomy was combined with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP); 37 patients had pathological levels of serum creatinine and 17 had pathological dilatation of the upper urinary tract, 6 of whom required a nephrostomy catheter. Because of anaemia on admission, 21 patients received a peri-operative blood transfusion. Two patients had significant post-operative bleeding, 2 developed a wound infection and 1 had a deep thrombophlebitis. The patients' mean age was 76.4 years and the period of hospitalisation ranged from 3 to 150 days with peaks at 3 and 8 days. The most important reason for prolonged hospitalisation was social problems. It was concluded that many patients who were hospitalised as a direct consequence of their prostatic carcinoma would have been in hospital for a similar period regardless of the method of hormonal manipulation used. Because so many patients have other reasons for hospitalisation, or require additional surgical procedures such as TURP, the true average cost of orchiectomy for advanced prostatic cancer is difficult to determine. \nLow molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) reduces restenosis after iliac angioplasty in the hypercholesterolemic rabbit. Smooth muscle cell proliferation is central to the process of restenosis. Attempts to inhibit the events leading to this proliferation have met with little success. In addition to its known antithrombotic effects, heparin also has inhibitory effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation. These effects appear to be unrelated to its anticoagulant properties and are retained in low molecular weight heparin derivatives. Although the use of heparin for as long as 18 to 24 h after coronary angioplasty in humans has not prevented restenosis, longer treatment periods have not been assessed. This study examines the effect of treatment with a low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit iliac artery model. Control rabbits had a mean iliac artery diameter of 0.70 +/- 0.06 mm, which increased to 1.73 +/- 0.09 mm after balloon angioplasty. At follow-up angiography 4 weeks later, the mean vessel diameter was 0.56 +/- 0.12 mm. Animals treated with low dose enoxaparin (1 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks and high dose enoxaparin (10 mg/kg per day) for either 2 or 4 weeks had similar mean luminal diameters before and immediately after angioplasty. At follow-up angiography, the mean luminal diameter was 0.82 +/- 0.17 mm for low dose enoxaparin, 1.04 +/- 0.20 mm for 2 week high dose enoxaparin (p = 0.03 versus control) and 1.19 +/- 0.09 mm for 4 week high dose enoxaparin (p = 0.001 versus control). When defined as loss of 50% of the initial gain achieved with angioplasty, restenosis was found in all control vessels. \nIntratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity in a benign neoplasm. Cytogenetic findings are reported in a 64-year-old man who had a history of rapid growth of a mass in the left groin area. The histopathologic diagnosis of the tumor was consistent with that of a lipoma with atypia. Cytogenetic analysis was done on an incisional biopsy specimen. The initial biopsy specimen revealed, in addition to normal cells, three different clones: 46,XY,t(12;21)(q13;q21), 46,XY, t(2;12)(q11.2'1.2), t(19;20)(q13.1'3), and 47.XY,+ r. The subsequently excised specimen showed a normal male karyotype (46,XY) and a predominant clone with the karyotype, 47,XY,t(2;12)(q11.2'1.2),t(3;11)(p24'5), + r. One cell with 47,XY, + r was present. In addition, polyploid cells with large markers, rings, and a high frequency of telomeric associations were also observed. \nShort-bowel syndrome: a review of the role of nutrition support. Advances in long-term venous access devices and in parenteral nutrition solutions have made it possible for patients with severe short bowel syndrome to survive and to live in our society. The spectrum of this disease is such that some patients may be able to lessen their dependence or even become free from parenteral therapy. This review will discuss the role of nutrition support in the patient with short bowel syndrome. \nA prospective evaluation of arterial intimal injuries in an experimental model. The management of arterial intimal defects remains controversial because of uncertainty concerning their natural history. We developed an experimental canine model to prospectively evaluate posterior wall intimal flaps in the superficial femoral artery. Arterial intimal flaps were constructed in 20 anesthetized dogs (40 arteries) and evaluated by arteriography, and angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. Postoperative patency rates at 1 (n = 20) and 3 weeks (n = 20) were compared with a control group of ten animals (n = 20, arteriotomy without intimal flap). Acute thromboses occurred in five experimental arteries with thromboses of eight additional experimental arteries at followup. Control patency was 100%, while experimental group patencies were 75% (p less than 0.05) at 1 week and 60% (p less than 0.009) at 3 weeks. All thrombosed arteries had intimal flaps with greater than 75% luminal stenosis. We conclude that intimal injuries cause arterial thromboses acutely and during subsequent followup. Intimal flaps with stenosis greater than 75% as determined arteriographically are at greatest risk for thrombosis. Angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound characterize arterial intimal defects and may delineate injuries requiring surgical or endovascular repair. \nSuccessful treatment of primary amebic meningoencephalitis. The fourth documented survivor of primary amebic meningoencephalitis, a young man with a history of waterskiing in a stagnant freshwater lake in northeastern Pennsylvania, is presented. Early consideration of this unusual diagnosis, based on historical factors (recent contact with warm fresh water), coupled with prompt aggressive therapy with high-dose amphotericin B is emphasized in achieving a successful outcome. \nSecretory IgA- and IgG-coated bacteria in chronically discharging ears. SIgA- and IgG-coated bacteria obtained from 17 discharging middle ears (14 patients, 9 male, 5 female, age range from 1 to 79 years) were evaluated using an immunofluorescence assay. Simultaneously, quantitative and qualitative bacteriological analyses of the middle ear effusions (MEEs) were performed. MEEs containing Staphylococcus aureus harboured bacteria which were intensely coated with both SIgA and IgG antibodies. In contrast, MEEs containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed minimal, if any, SIgA- and IgG-coated bacteria. Two young patients harboured bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae and S. aureus/Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively) which were heavily coated with IgG, but not with SIgA. Immunoglobulin-coating of bacteria involved in otitis media is of the utmost importance in eradication of the infection. \nA case of granulomatous hepatitis after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration. A 61-year-old man received intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as treatment for superficial bladder carcinoma. High spiking relapsing fevers began 39 days after the initial treatment. A liver biopsy revealed noncaseating granuloma. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization of the bone marrow was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Pressure exerted to instill the BCG may have favored dissemination. \nEffects of pulsed Nd:YAG laser on the surface of rabbit retina. Six albino rabbits were subjected to pulsed Nd:YAG laser irradiation to the retinal surface to determine whether such treatment would lead to proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Choroidal, retinal, and preretinal hemorrhages, noted at the time of treatment, resolved after 7 to 10 days. Histological examination showed no signs of anterior segment damage or proliferative vitreoretinopathy. These preliminary findings suggest that more extensive experimentation is warranted to determine if pulsed Nd:YAG laser may in fact safely be used to separate vitreoretinal adhesions in the treatment of retinal detachment. \nCutaneous polyarteritis nodosa and ulcerative colitis. Vasculitis in many forms has been reported rarely in association with ulcerative colitis. We report the occurrence of necrotizing vasculitis in a 48-year-old man 19 years after the onset of ulcerative colitis and 5 years after total colectomy with rectal preservation. The disease was limited to small arteries of skin and muscle consistent with the syndrome of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa that has been reported with regional enteritis but not previously with ulcerative colitis. \nNeurologic complications of infective endocarditis. Neurologic syndromes often complicate the management of infective endocarditis (IE). We retrospectively reviewed 166 episodes of native valve endocarditis to assess the occurrence and implications of nonfocal encephalopathy, meningitis, salient headache, back pain, and brain abscess. Neurologic complications occurred in 35% (58/166) of patients: 41% (54/133) of mitral or aortic valve IE and 12% (4/33) of tricuspid valve IE. Of 133 cases of mitral or aortic valve IE, encephalopathy occurred in 14%, meningitis in 5%, and salient headache in 3%. All neurologic complications occurred more often with Staphylococcus aureus infection (67%) than with viridans streptococci (22%), including encephalopathy (22% versus 7%), meningitis (17% versus 0%), stroke (39% versus 16%), and death (39% versus 9%). Encephalopathy was associated with virulent organisms, increased patient age, and uncontrolled infection. Clinical, radiologic, and neuropathologic data all suggest that infective microemboli are often etiologic in IE-related encephalopathy. There were no macroscopic brain abscesses clinically identified. Meningitis occurred only with virulent organisms. While many clinical aspects of IE have changed in recent years, the frequency and gravity of neurologic complications have not. \np53 in chronic myelogenous leukemia in acute phase. All patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) undergo clinical transition from chronic to acute phase. This transition is often associated with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 in the form of the i(17q) aberration. Since the p53 gene is a suppressor gene and is located on 17p13, we examined the possibility that it is inactivated during progression of CML. Therefore, we studied the structure and expression of p53 in the leukemic cells of a large number of CML patients in acute phase. We found that although the gene is rarely rearranged, one p53 allele is completely deleted in patients with the i(17q) aberration as well as in some patients who do not show karyotypic changes. In all of these patients the remaining allele is inactivated through loss of expression, rearrangement, or point mutation. Detailed analysis of some patients who carry both p53 alleles indicated neither loss of expression nor structural alterations. It appears that p53 loss of function is associated with progression of around 25% of CML patients. \nEarly postoperative sternal approximation after ITA harvesting: computed tomographic evaluation. Between November 1989 and February 1990, 66 randomized sternotomized patients underwent aortocoronary bypass and were subjected to a sternal scanner in the early postoperative period. Each examination included a manubrial and a sternal body print. At each level, we studied the occurrence of spacing or misalignment of the sternal layers. The 66 patients were subdivided into four groups according to the type of conduit harvested (single left internal thoracic artery or saphenous vein) and the type of material used for the sternal closure (steel wires or nylon yarns). In all cases, adequate early sternal approximation, which is represented by a good alignment as well as by an excellent contact of the sternal layers, was infrequently demonstrated. Moreover, the two abnormalities most often observed were manubrial spacing and sternal body misalignment. The sternal closure technique and internal thoracic artery harvesting had no significant effect on the sternal approximation. To minimize manubrial spacing and sternal body misalignment, we propose that the surgeon should apply three threads through the manubrium, withdraw the shoulder roll beforehand, elevate both of the patient's shoulders, and maintain the two xyphoid layers in the same plane and in fairly close contact during the tightening of the wires. \nExophytic signet-ring cell carcinoma of the colorectum Previous studies have assessed colorectal signet-ring cell carcinomas of the linitis plastica variant but not of the exophytic subtype. We retrospectively reviewed 20 cases of colorectal signet-ring cell carcinoma of the exophytic subtype (greater than 50% signet-ring cells). The patients ranged in age from 14 to 79 years (mean, 51.8 years); 10 were male; 17 were white; and three were black. Ten tumors were colonic (eight, right sided; two, left sided) and 10 were rectal; seven were stage B and 12 were stage C. One patient presented with distant metastases. Eleven of 16 tumors assessed by flow cytometry were diploid. Parenchymal hepatic metastases developed in only two patients. The overall 5-year survival rate was 36%, and matched cases did not vary significantly in survival from typical nonmucinous adenocarcinomas. There was a trend toward poorer survival for patients with advanced-stage tumor. Survival was not affected by primary site, ploidy, presence of vascular/lymphatic invasion or residual adenoma, or percentage of extracellular mucin or signet-ring cells. Our cases were somewhat lower stage than literature cases of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lintis plastica variant. \nImprovement of estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide cholestasis by intravenous administration of dimethylethanolamine in the rat. The intravenous administration of dimethylethanolamine in the rat promotes a selective enrichment of liver membranes with polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines. The effect of dimethylethanolamine pretreatment on cholestasis induced by estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide, a potent cholestatic agent, was assessed in this study. Dimethylethanolamine, dissolved in sodium-taurocholate was infused intravenously (0.3 mg/kg/min) for 15 hr. One group of control rats (estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls) received the bile salt only. An estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide bolus was then injected intravenously (10.4 mg/kg) into dimethylethanolamine-pretreated and estradiol 17 beta-D-control rats, and its effect on bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was compared for 3 hr. The estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide inhibitory effect on bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was significantly antagonized by dimethylethanolamine pretreatment. The maximum inhibition of bile flow was found 30 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration, when it decreased from 3.5 +/- 0.4 microliters/min/100 gm (basal) to 0.9 +/- 0.3 microliters/min/100 gm in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls, whereas in dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats this decreased only from 3.2 +/- 0.4 (basal) to 2.3 +/- 0.4 microliters/min/100 gm. Bile flow and the biliary secretion of cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine and bile salts were significantly higher in the dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats than in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls (p less than 0.02) during the cholestatic phase. The inhibitory effect of estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide on bile flow was associated with a marked decrease of membrane fluidity (p less than 0.001) assessed by 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy and with a cholesterol enrichment of microsomes, sinusoidal and canalicular liver plasma membranes and inhibition of sinusoidal Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity (p less than 0.05). These membrane alterations persisted 180 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration despite complete normalization of bile flow. Dimethylethanolamine pretreatment significantly counteracted the reduction of membrane fluidity (p less than 0.001), the cholesterol enrichment and the inhibition of Na+,K(+)-ATPase (p less than 0.05) promoted by estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration in all membrane subfractions 30 and 180 min after administration. In addition, dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats had more polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane phosphatidylcholine with respect to the control groups. Dilatation of canaliculi and loss of microvilli were evident in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls 180 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nFailure to awaken after general anaesthesia secondary to paradoxical venous embolus. A patient is presented who failed to regain consciousness after an apparently uneventful nine-hour revision of a total hip replacement. There were no clinically important haemodynamic changes during the operation, and oxygen saturation, capnography and acid base balance were normal throughout. Postop CT of the head showed a large left MCA infarct with midline shift. At autopsy, the patient was found to have a previously unsuspected patent foramen ovale, and a venous embolus in the left internal carotid artery, which probably had originated from the periprostatic venous plexus with a large infarct in the distribution of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The authors conclude that massive paradoxical venous emboli can occur during surgery with minimal haemodynamic changes. \nRadiographically occult endobronchial obstruction in bronchogenic carcinoma. PURPOSE: While central endobronchial tumors may become radiographically detectable when they cause significant endobronchial obstruction, the incidence of radiographically undetectable obstruction is not known. This study prospectively examined the incidence of radiographically undetectable completely obstructing lesions encountered during routine diagnostic bronchoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred for bronchoscopy at the San Diego Veterans Administration Medical Center because of suspected bronchogenic carcinoma formed the population base. Chest radiographs were interpreted routinely 24 hours prior to bronchoscopy. Patients found to have complete endobronchial obstruction during bronchoscopy were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Eighty-one completely obstructing lesions were found in 77 patients. No radiographic signs of obstruction were found in 36 (44%) completely obstructing endobronchial lesions. There was no difference in the rate of radiographically occult tumors based on cell type. Obstruction of segmental bronchi was more likely to be undetectable than obstruction of more proximal airways. Chest radiographs were normal in 13 (16%). All 13 had risk factors for and symptoms suggestive of bronchogenic carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Complete endobronchial obstruction due to bronchogenic carcinoma can occur frequently in patients at risk for lung cancer. The significant incidence of radiographically undetectable complete obstruction has implications for the diagnosis, staging, and assessment of treatment of lung cancer. \nCurative potential of primary whole-abdomen irradiation in ovarian carcinoma. Ovarian carcinoma remains a leading cause of cancer mortality in American women. The identification of active chemotherapy drugs and regimens has resulted in much less frequent use of radiation therapy at a time when technical and conceptual advances have been made. Unfortunately, the shift from radiotherapy to chemotherapy has not produced a discernible improvement in patient survival. Retrospective and prospective data suggest that whole-abdomen irradiation offers curative potential in patients with nonbulky residual disease after surgical cytoreduction. Its use should therefore be reconsidered as a primary adjuvant therapy in properly selected patients. \nDifferences in release of tumor necrosis factor from THP-1 cells stimulated by filtrates of antibiotic-killed Escherichia coli. Bacterial products, such as endotoxin, activate mononuclear cells to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other monokines capable of producing host cell injury. THP-1 cell TNF release in response to bacterial products generated during antibiotic killing of Escherichia coli (ATCC 12014) was evaluated. THP-1 is a mature monocytic leukemia cell line that produces TNF in a dose-dependent fashion in response to purified endotoxin. E. coli were incubated in the presence of amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, aztreonam, or imipenem at concentrations that killed greater than 99.9% of the organisms. Aliquots of these antibiotic-bacterial cultures were added to THP-1 cells, and TNF concentrations were determined by specific immunoassay. Amikacin and imipenem produced rapid bacterial killing and were associated with low TNF levels. Ceftazidime, aztreonam, and cefotaxime killed E. coli at a slower rate and were associated with significant increases in mononuclear cell TNF responses. Ciprofloxacin produced intermediate TNF levels. Differences exist among bactericidal antibodies in their ability to generate products capable of stimulating mononuclear cell TNF release. \nCyclic AMP mediates the direct antiproliferative action of mismatched double-stranded RNA. Previous experiments have demonstrated that double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) can exert an antiproliferative effect on human tumor cells, independent of interferon (IFN) induction. However, the mechanism by which dsRNAs inhibit tumor growth has not been elucidated. As a first step in determining the molecular events responsible for growth arrest, we have explored the role of signal transduction through the cAMP system in the antiproliferative effect of the mismatched dsRNA, r(I)n.r(C12,U)n (Ampligen). These studies utilized the human glioma cell line A1235, which does not produce detectable levels of IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma in response to mismatched dsRNA treatment. Treatment of A1235 cells with mismatched dsRNA in combination with either 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), which inhibits cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, or N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA1004), which preferentially inhibits the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, yielded an antagonism of the mismatched dsRNA-induced antiproliferative effect. Measurement of adenylate cyclase activation showed a dose-dependent increase in activity at antiproliferative mismatched dsRNA concentrations, but not at lower, nonantiproliferative doses. This increase in activity was rapid, seen as early as 30 sec after initiation of treatment, and it was sustained at peak levels for 1-2 hr. Analysis of the intracellular cAMP concentration gave ",
