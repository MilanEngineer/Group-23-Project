        "text": "n, Panwarfin, Sofarin) are used most often to treat acute and recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, arterial disease, valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation. These agents along with dextran, pneumatic compression devices, and gradient stockings are also used to prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients at high risk (eg, those with venous stasis, lower limb or spinal cord trauma, clotting abnormalities). Anticoagulation therapy is monitored by maintaining the activated partial thromboplastin time and the prothrombin time in the therapeutic range. \nClonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in the infarcted lymph node syndrome. The authors report a case of complete lymph node infarction in which a specific etiology could not be determined by morphologic or immunophenotypic studies; however, clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin gene was demonstrated by Southern blot hybridization of DNA extracted from the necrotic tissue. A subsequent lymph node biopsy later was diagnosed as malignant lymphoma, using morphologic, immunophenotypic and genotypic criteria. Identical clonally rearranged bands were present in DNA from both the infarcted nodal and the subsequent tissue biopsies. In the setting of lymph node necrosis, gene rearrangement studies may provide diagnostic information concerning clonality, even if morphologic and immunophenotypic studies are indeterminate for a lymphoproliferative process. \nCerebral structure on magnetic resonance imaging in language- and learning-impaired children. Using magnetic resonance imaging 20 language- and learning-impaired children were compared with 12 normal control subjects. Gross brain structure was remarkably normal in the language- and learning-impaired group. Semiautomated morphometry was used to measure hemispheric volumes and cerebral asymmetries in six cerebral regions. The volume of the left posterior perisylvian region was significantly reduced in language- and learning-impaired children. Asymmetries in inferoanterior and superoposterior cerebral regions were also significantly different in this group. Results of descriptive group comparisons of estimated volumes of other cerebral gray-matter structures raise the possibility that some language- and learning-impaired children may have additional volume reductions in cortical and subcortical structures. The results suggest that hemispheric specialization of function may be anomalous in this population. \nIntraovarian abscess treated with laparoscopic aspiration and povidone-iodine lavage. A case report. Intraovarian abscess is an unusual form of pelvic inflammatory disease usually managed with laparotomy. A patient with prolonged morbidity from an intraovarian abscess following pelvic inflammatory disease associated with an intrauterine contraceptive device was managed with laparoscopically guided needle aspiration of the abscess and povidone-iodine lavage. Laparoscopy should play a greater role in the management of pelvic inflammatory disease. \nHemifacial spasm. Occurrence in multiple sclerosis. We present six patients with hemifacial spasm and multiple sclerosis. To our knowledge, this association has not been described previously in the North American literature. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all the patients and plaques consistent with multiple sclerosis were identified. In two patients the plaques were seen in the area of the facial nucleus on the involved side. We suggest that hemifacial spasm can be a manifestation of multiple sclerosis. These cases illustrate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging in the investigation of hemifacial spasm. Our findings also support a central (nuclear) origin in multiple sclerosis associated with hemifacial spasm. \nVenous thromboembolism after brain tumor surgery: a retrospective review. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence rate of clinical postoperative deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in 1703 patients undergoing initial craniotomy for meningioma, glioma, or cerebral metastasis. The incidence rate of clinical thromboembolic complications was 1.59% for all tumor groups within the first 4 weeks of surgery. Patients undergoing surgery for meningiomas had a statistically significant increased risk of thromboembolism despite fewer overall perioperative risk factors, when compared with the other tumor groups. The tumor-specific incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism for meningioma, glioma, and metastasis were 3.09%, 0.97%, and 1.03%, respectively. Whether this difference was a result of increased surgical time or an inherent property of meningiomas could not be ascertained. \nElevated cerebrospinal fluid pressures in patients with cryptococcal meningitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Increased intracranial pressure has been a noteworthy problem in some of our patients with cryptococcal meningitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and this appears to be a feature observed in patients with cryptococcal meningitis reported in the literature. Whereas most attention of clinicians is presently focused on optimizing the antifungal regimen, so as to improve on high failure rates in cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS, little attention has been paid to the problem of intracranial hypertension. We argue that visual loss and some of the cases of death early after the onset of chemotherapy may be related to high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, regardless of antifungal therapy. The possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed, and we postulate that the mechanism is reduced CSF outflow possibly due to increased outflow resistance, not necessarily accompanied by prominent cerebral edema. Optimal therapy of this complication is not yet established, but some measures that may be helpful are ventricular shunting, frequent high-volume lumbar punctures, and possibly glucocorticoids. \nBarriers to cholesterol testing in a rural community. BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that determine whether residents in a rural community have their cholesterol tested. METHODS. A population-based survey was conducted in 1987 as part of a community-oriented primary care project that sought to define and address the causes of and burden caused by increased cardiovascular disease in an economically depressed agricultural region of New York. All of the residents living in two towns in the region who were over 16 years of age and who lived in their homes year-round were surveyed. Demographic information was obtained from the participants, as well as information about previous cholesterol testing and their cardiovascular-risk knowledge and behaviors. The serum cholesterol of each participant was measured. RESULTS. Of the 557 households contacted, 508 (91%) households participated. A total of 1063 persons over 16 years of age were surveyed, and 973 (92%) were screened for cholesterol. Overall, 24% reported prior cholesterol testing. Logistic regression analysis identified several independent factors that were associated with a reduced likelihood of ever having had a cholesterol test. These factors included: (1) age under 45 years, (2) having less than 12 years of education, (3) having an income of less than $10,000, (4) not having health insurance, (5) not having visited a physician within the previous year, and (6) practicing three or more high-risk cardiovascular behaviors. The participants' cardiovascular knowledge made no independent contribution to having had their cholesterol levels tested. CONCLUSIONS. Many of the factors that prevent cholesterol testing are socially determined. The results of this study suggest that financial and social barriers are two of the major obstacles to residents of rural communities having their cholesterol levels tested. \nLymphocytic gastritis in nonulcer dyspepsia. The prevalence of lymphocytic gastritis, a specific form of chronic gastritis characterized by infiltration of gastric superficial epithelium with T lymphocytes, has been established in nonulcer dyspepsia. Among a population sample of 586 patients at risk for gastric carcinoma, 0.83% of patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and 1.63% of patients with chronic active gastritis showed lymphocytic gastritis. Among routine gastric biopsies from 5130 patients, only five cases met histological and immunohistochemical criteria of lymphocytic gastritis. \nSleep apnea in infants who succumb to the sudden infant death syndrome. Previous studies have shown the frequency of respiratory pauses to be altered in groups of infants at risk for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In this study, we assess the frequency of apneic pauses during quiet sleep and rapid eye movement sleep in control infants and infants who subsequently died of SIDS. Sleep states were identified in 12-hour physiological recordings of SIDS victims and matched control infants, and the number of respiratory pauses from 4 to 30 seconds in duration was computed for quiet sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. SIDS victims 40 to 65 days of age showed significantly fewer apneic pauses than did age-matched control infants across the two sleep states. Fewer short respiratory pauses accounted for most of the reduction in number of apneic events in the SIDS victims during both sleep states. During the first month of life, SIDS victims did not differ significantly from control neonates on this measure. The finding that this respiratory difference exists during the second month of life, just before the period of maximal risk for SIDS, but not earlier, may have implications for the etiology of SIDS deaths. \nMyeloablative therapy and unpurged autologous bone marrow transplantation for poor-prognosis neuroblastoma: report of 34 cases. From October 1984 to November 1987, 34 patients aged from 1 year 1 month to 7 years 7 months with resistant or relapsed neuroblastoma (NB) (group 1, 10 patients), unselected disseminated NB (group 2, 14 patients), or selected disseminated NB (group 3, 10 patients) received myeloablative therapy (MAT) followed by unpurged autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) at the end of an intensive protocol, which included high-dose chemotherapy and surgery to the primary tumor. Median time from diagnosis to MAT and ABMT was 6 months (5 months from last relapse to MAT and ABMT in the relapsed patients). The MAT regimen included vincristine, fractionated total body irradiation (TBI), and melphalan. Seventeen patients were grafted in complete remission (CR), five in very good partial remission (VGPR), 10 in partial remission (PR), and two in progressive disease (PD). The acute toxic death rate was 2.9%. The overall progression-free survival was 29%. The median progression-free survival was 20 months for the 17 patients grafted in CR, 6 months for the five patients grafted in VGPR, and 12 months for the 10 patients grafted in PR. \nVariation of initial serum bilirubin rise in newborn infants with type of illness. Hyperbilirubinaemia in newborn infants is generally regarded as a problem, and bilirubin itself as toxic metabolic waste, but the high frequency in newborn infants suggests that the excess of neonatal bilirubin may have a positive function. To investigate the hypothesis that bilirubin has a role as a free-radical scavenger, the rate of rise in serum bilirubin in the first few days of life was measured in 44 infants with five illnesses thought to enhance free-radical production and in 58 control infants. The infants were selected from 2700 consecutive births by exclusion of those with factors known to affect bilirubin metabolism, including enteral feeding. The control infants were those who seemed to be ill and received treatment, including restriction of enteral feeds, but in whom no illness, or disorders not related to free-radical production, were found. The mean serum bilirubin rise was significantly lower in the combined illness group than in the control group (36.1 [95% Cl 26.9-45.3] vs 66.7 [55.9-77.5] mumol.l-1.day-1; p less than 0.0001). In subgroup analyses the mean rises in infants with circulatory failure, neonatal depression/asphyxia, aspiration syndromes, and proven sepsis were significantly lower than in controls matched for gestational age and birthweight, but rises in infants with respiratory distress and their matched controls did not differ. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that bilirubin is consumed in vivo as an antioxidant. Such consumption may operate in vivo in addition to the standard pathways for bilirubin metabolism (production, isomerisation, and excretion). \nStereopsis after unilateral anterior temporal lobectomy. Dissociation between local and global measures. In man, an impairment in stereopsis may occur following damage outside the occipital lobes. If local and global stereopsis can be dissociated, this may imply that different mechanisms mediate these functions. We tested 44 patients with unilateral anterior temporal lobe excisions and 23 normal control subjects on two tasks. In the local stereopsis task, subjects indicated which of two pins varying in disparity between 4 and 512 s of arc was closer. Results showed no threshold impairment in any group. In the global stereopsis task, random-dot stereograms varying in binocular correlation were presented in random order, and subjects indicated if the squares perceived in depth were in front of or behind the screen. At binocular correlations between 50% and 70%, left and right temporal lobectomy resulted in a deficit, which was more marked following right-sided excisions. These results are concordant with earlier work (Ptito and Zatorre, 1988), and with other evidence of a right hemisphere superiority in treating binocular depth information. Moreover, the fact that global stereopsis is impaired in the presence of intact local stereopsis suggests that closely related but not identical mechanisms are involved, and fits the notion that there is a hierarchical organization of the visual pathways originating in the striate cortex leading into temporal cortex. Global stereopsis would thus be mediated in temporal lobe areas that receive information about local disparities from more posterior regions. \nA randomized controlled trial of a 12-month course of recombinant human interferon-alpha in chronic delta (type D) hepatitis: a multicenter Italian study. To determine whether long-term therapy with recombinant interferon-alpha can improve the course of chronic delta hepatitis, 61 Italian patients with this disease were randomly assigned to receive either interferon-alpha-2b three times a week (5 MU/m2 for 4 mo and then 3 MU/m2 for another 8 mo) or no treatment. At the end of the 12-mo study, all patients were followed-up for 12 additional months. Normalization or decrease of more than 50% from baseline of serum ALT levels occurred in 42% of treated patients the fourth month of therapy, 26% the twelfth month and 3% the twenty-fourth month vs. 7%, 7% and 0%, respectively, in the control group. However, relapses occurred in 7 of 8 (87.5%) responders 1 to 10 mo (mean = 3.5 mo) after cessation of therapy. Liver biopsies were carried out at baseline and during the twelfth month of treatment. Histological improvement, mostly caused by decrease of portal inflammation, was observed in 57% of treated and 36% of untreated patients. Measures of antiviral activity (serum hepatitis delta virus RNA and intrahepatic hepatitis delta antigen) showed similar levels in treated and control patients. In treated patients the percentage of patients who were negative for HDV RNA never exceeded that of baseline. Although interferon-alpha in the dosage given in this study had no antiviral effect on patients with chronic hepatitis D, it reduced hepatic inflammation as measured by ALT levels. Whether a longer duration or reinstitution of interferon-alpha therapy would achieve long-term control of ALT levels and prevent chronic liver damage is not known. \nBeriberi heart disease in a schizophrenic with an unusual diet. A 37-year-old male presented with peripheral edema of sudden onset. Other signs of heart failure were absent. Subsequent evaluation revealed that the patient was a schizophrenic whose diet consisted almost entirely of carbohydrates. A clinical diagnosis of beriberi heart disease was made and the patient improved dramatically within several days of thiamine supplementation. The presentation of beriberi heart disease in developed countries is discussed. Emphasis is placed on food faddists and psychiatric patients in whom clinical findings may be subtle or absent. \nMicroscopic activity in ulcerative colitis: what does it mean? To determine the prognostic importance of microscopic rectal inflammation we followed up 82 patients (aged 21 to 78 years, 44 men) with chronic quiescent ulcerative colitis over 12 months. At trial entry each patient underwent a rectal biopsy and sections were graded independently by two histopathologists. A chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate of varying severity was present in all biopsy specimens, and 58% had crypt architectural irregularities. In addition, 32% had evidence of acute inflammatory activity: 28% acute inflammatory cell infiltrate, 11% crypt abscesses, and 22% mucin depletion. Agreement between the two histopathologists for the presence of each of these features was 94% (90-98%). During the 12 month follow up 27 patients (33%) relapsed after a mean interval of 18 weeks (range 3-44 weeks). Relapse rates were unrelated to duration or extent of disease or to the type of maintenance drug treatment. In patients with an acute inflammatory cell infiltrate 52% relapsed, whereas in the absence of such an infiltrate only 25% relapsed (p = 0.02). Similarly, relapse rates were higher in the presence of crypt abscesses (78% v 27%, p less than 0.005), mucin depletion (56% v p less than 0.02), and breaches in the surface epithelium (75% v 31%, p = 0.1). The presence of a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate or crypt architectural irregularities, however, bore no relation to the frequency of colitis relapse. \nThe incidence and relationship of cervical spine anomalies in patients with cleft lip and/or palate. The relationship, incidence, and distribution of cervical spine anomalies were assessed in 468 patients with cleft lip and/or palate. The patients were placed into four groups: lip and/or alveolar; complete unilateral or bilateral; isolated palatal; and soft palate or submucous clefts. Cervical anomalies were observed in 22% of the cleft patients and in 7% of the noncleft group. Patients with soft palate and submucous clefts had the highest incidence of vertebral anomalies (45%), whereas patients with cleft lip and/or alveolus had an incidence similar to the noncleft group. Patients with complete unilateral and bilateral clefts also had a higher incidence (15.6% to 19.0%) of anomalies than the noncleft group. Cervical anomalies occurred primarily in the occipital-C1-C2 region. The possible implications of these findings are discussed. \nThe use of direct mail to increase clinician knowledge: an intervention study. A probability sample of American general practitioner dentists, 40 years of age or older, in solo private practice, was the target of two direct mail interventions offered at two different times, to test whether knowledge regarding prophylaxis of patients at risk for infective endocarditis could be improved. Tests of knowledge were responses in a mail questionnaire to clinical vignettes, designed to elicit the content of antibiotic regimens used for patients at risk. The research design enabled detection of (1) the effect of the interventions; (2) the differences in their effect; (3) the attenuation of their effect; and (4) the effect of time. Where baseline knowledge was low, it was improved and did not rapidly disappear. Both mail interventions were equally effective, in most instances, and there was no attenuation of the interventions' effect and no effect of time on the control groups' knowledge over a 4 1/2 month period. The results suggest that it is possible to improve clinicians' knowledge of expert recommendations through direct mail intervention. \nBudd-Chiari syndrome in association with Behcet's disease. Budd-Chiari syndrome developed in 3 patients with preexisting Behcet's disease. Benign intracranial hypertension was the chief presenting complaint in one patient, who later suffered extensive inferior vena caval and hepatic vein thrombosis, with manifestations of Budd-Chiari syndrome. She did not respond to treatment and subsequently died of hepatic coma. In the other 2 patients, Budd-Chiari syndrome was confirmed by liver biopsy. Both patients made a good recovery and remain well at the time of this report. \nBiplane transesophageal echocardiography: clinical applications of the long-axis plane. Tomography of the heart and great vessels is limited during conventional transesophageal echocardiography by the inability to rotate the transducer at the end of the transesophageal echocardiographic endoscope. A biplane transesophageal echocardiographic probe has been developed recently with a second transducer capable of long-axis imaging that yields long-axis views in addition to the familiar short-axis views. We describe our experience with 37 patients with a variety of cardiovascular diseases. In 17 patients new diagnostic information was obtained, although management was not changed. Long-axis scanning was particularly useful in the assessment of diseases of the thoracic aorta, valvular morphology and regurgitation, and congenital heart disease. Important limitations of the biplane imaging system include reduced image quality and a continued inability to rotate the transducer to obtain any desired plane of imaging. Nonetheless, biplane imaging enhances the versatility of transesophageal echocardiography and improves three-dimensional conceptualization of cardiac disease. \nArachnoid cyst of the cerebellopontine angle manifesting as contralateral trigeminal neuralgia: case report. A case of an arachnoid cyst in the cerebellopontine angle manifesting as contralateral trigeminal neuralgia is presented. Decompression and excision of the lesion resulted in total relief of symptoms. The possible causes of contralateral trigeminal neuralgia are briefly reviewed, and the surgical treatment of this entity is discussed. \nAlpha 2-macroglobulin-kallikrein complexes detect contact system activation in hereditary angioedema and human sepsis. Activation of the contact system has been documented in severe sepsis and hereditary angioedema, but a sensitive, specific, and quantitative assay for assessing the degree of involvement of this proteolytic enzyme cascade is not yet available. We have developed a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-kallikrein (alpha 2M-Kal) complex using an F(ab')2 derivative of a monospecific polyclonal antibody against alpha 2 M as the capture antibody and a unique murine monoclonal antibody, 13G11, against the heavy chain of kallikrein as the detector antibody. The assay does not detect complexes in normal plasma but reacts with complexes generated by activating normal plasma with dextran sulfate at 4 degrees C in a range of 5 to 375 nmol/L. A close correlation of the ELISA with an amidolytic assay for alpha 2M-Kal was documented. Patients with sepsis syndrome but negative bacterial blood cultures did not show elevated plasma complexes, whereas a majority of those with positive blood cultures did show modest elevation and a single patient with septic shock showed a very high level of alpha 2M-Kal complex. Similarly, a patient with classic hereditary angioedema (HAE) showed increased concentration of complexes on three separate occasions during attacks but normal levels between attacks. Two other HAE patients did not show elevated levels at quiescent periods. The ELISA for alpha 2M-Kal appears to be sensitive, specific, and quantitative, and it can be used to reflect the degree of contact system activation in human sepsis and in HAE attacks. \nProgressive loss of speech output and orofacial dyspraxia associated with frontal lobe hypometabolism. Three patients are described with slowly progressive loss of speech and dysarthria associated with orofacial dyspraxia, initially with intact written language, who subsequently developed more widespread cognitive abnormalities. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed bifrontal hypometabolism in all of the patients, most marked in the inferior and lateral portions of both frontal lobes, with some extension into the parietal and temporal cortices in one case. These patients may represent a further example of focal progressive cortical degeneration. \nMucocutaneous disease in pediatric human immunodeficiency virus infection. Children with HIV infection may develop a wide variety of infectious and inflammatory diseases of the skin. These disorders are often more severe and more difficult to treat than in the healthy child. In some cases, disorders of the skin or mucous membranes may provide an early clue to the presence of pediatric HIV infection. \nOverwhelming necrotizing tracheobronchitis due to inadequate humidification during high-frequency jet ventilation. Necrotizing tracheobronchitis (NT) associated with conventional mechanical ventilation or high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) is a lesion reported most often in neonates. In most cases, a specific cause is not identified. We describe a case of NT in an adult that occurred during HFJV and was attributable to inadequate humidification. \nHelicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcer. PURPOSE PATIENTS AND METHODS: Helicobacter pylori (HP) is present in more than 90% of duodenal ulcers (DUs). To investigate the pathophysiology in those patients with DU who are HP-negative compared with those who are HP-positive, we interviewed consecutive patients prior to endoscopy regarding factors often associated with ulcer disease. At esophagogastroduodenoscopy, antral biopsy specimens were obtained for urease test, culture, and Warthin Starry staining for HP in all patients with DU who did not have active bleeding. RESULTS: Compared with HP-positive patients who had DU, HP-negative patients with DU were more likely to be aspirin users and less likely to have had prior ulcers. HP-positive patients with DU had more severe antral inflammation than HP-negative patients. Whites were more likely to be HP-negative than blacks. HP-negative patients with DU most commonly presented with bleeding, whereas HP-positive patients with DU presented with pain. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a different mechanism for DUs in patients who are HP-positive versus those who are HP-negative, and this difference might have a bearing on treatment. The absence of HP should lead to a more thorough search for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug/aspirin use, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and other potential causes of DUs. \nIncreased MR signal intensity due to cervical myelopathy. Analysis of 29 surgical cases. The cases of 29 patients with cervical myelopathy, who had been treated by anterior spine fusion, were reviewed. The relationship between pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images was investigated with special reference to increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on the T2-weighted images and the relevance of this finding to clinical conditions. Preoperatively, there were areas of increased signal intensity in 12 patients whereas there were no areas of increased signal intensity in the other 17. The lesions were not clearly demonstrated on T1-weighted images. The pre- and postoperative clinical condition of the patients whose preoperative MR images showed areas of increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on T2-weighted images was worse than that of the patients who did not have areas of increased signal intensity. Of the 12 patients with regions of increased signal intensity preoperatively, five showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively compared to the preoperative levels and seven had no change. The postoperative recovery of the five patients who showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively was better than that of the seven patients who exhibited no change. The areas of increased MR signal in the spinal cord might be due to edema, cord gliosis, demyelination, or microcavities. \nIntraosseous vascular malformations of the orbit. Intraosseous vascular malformations are rare benign tumors involving the bones of the orbit. The diagnosis should be considered when a patient presents with an enlarging mass fixed to bone in the upper face, and the characteristic x-ray appearance should be looked for on plain films. Treatment is local excision of the bone containing the tumor and immediate reconstruction with autogenous bone. \nImpedance plethysmography: a new method for continuous muscle perfusion monitoring. Vigilant postoperative monitoring of the buried muscle flap is critical after free transfer because early diagnosis of vascular insufficiency is essential to allow prompt correction. We have identified a monitoring method utilizing needle electrodes and impedance plethysmography that gives a beat-to-beat representation of muscular perfusion. In 25 New Zealand White rabbits the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated on its vascular pedicle, and two intramuscular needle electrodes were placed. The instantaneous impedance changes of the muscle (corresponding to the pulsatile volume changes of perfusion) were measured and recorded. Using this representation of perfusion, an independent judge was able to correctly diagnose muscular ischemia 100 percent of the time (n = 25). Further, the judge was able to correctly distinguish the ischemia as arterial (n = 10) or venous (n = 10) in origin 100 percent of the time. Additionally, we monitored muscle perfusion transcutaneously in five free muscle flaps and demonstrated a reliable impedance signal that correlated with perfusion. \nImportance of antithrombin therapy during coronary angioplasty. Angioplasty procedures with balloons, cutters or lasers all may greatly enlarge the arterial lumen, but luminal diameter may decrease because of mural thrombus in 70% to 80%, smooth muscle proliferation, vasoconstriction or recoil. Thrombin binds to arterial wall matrix and fibrin within a thrombus. Heparin dose-dependently decreases platelet and thrombus deposition but does not eliminate these even at high doses. Specific thrombin inhibition started before angioplasty experimentally prevents mural thrombus and limits platelet deposition to a single layer or less. Experimentally, anticoagulant and antifibrin effects occur at lower antithrombin blood levels and lower activated partial thromboplastin times (1.7 times control). Because platelets are so sensitive to thrombin, the higher level of thrombin inhibition required may occur at a specific level (activated partial thromboplastin time greater than or equal to 2 times control); this is not defined in humans. The duration of therapy is not defined in animals or humans. Thrombus and thrombin may be related to cellular proliferation. \nA pathophysiological interpretation of unresponsiveness to spironolactone in a stepped-care approach to the diuretic treatment of ascites in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients. It has been hypothesized that the magnitude of proximal sodium reabsorption affects the response to aldosterone antagonists in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites. To verify this hypothesis, we evaluated intrarenal sodium handling by lithium clearance in 51 nonazotemic ascitic cirrhotic patients and in 23 controls who were maintained on the same low-sodium diet (80 mmol/day). Seven of 51 cirrhotic patients underwent spontaneous diuresis, whereas 44 required diuretic treatment. Treatment was started with spironolactone at a dose of 150 mg once daily. The dose was increased to 300 mg and then to 500 mg once daily if no response ensued. Cirrhotic patients who did not experience ascites mobilization with 500 mg spironolactone were then treated with a combined diuretic regimen that included spironolactone at a fixed dose (500 mg once daily) and furosemide at an initial dose of 50 mg once daily. The dose was increased to 100, 150 and 200 mg once daily if no response was noticed. Response to diuretic treatment was defined as body weight loss greater than 700 gm every 3 days until ascites became clinically undetectable. Nonresponders (43%) to spironolactone showed lower sodium fractional excretion (0.34% +/- 0.28% vs. 0.80% +/- 0.50%; p less than 0.001) because of a lower fractional sodium delivery to the distal tubule (18.2% +/- 5.8% vs. 23.4% +/- 7.2%; p less than 0.025) than responders. \nCorrection of non-24-hour sleep/wake cycle by melatonin in a blind retarded boy. A 9-year-old, blind boy with severe mental retardation with a chronic sleep/wake disturbance had a circadian rhythm of 24.75 hours and an internal desynchronization of the endogenous rhythms. Treatment with oral melatonin given at 6 PM induced a regular sleep/wake pattern. Melatonin, in this patient, convincingly entrained the endogenous rhythm to the appropriate chronological 24-hour day. \nSymptomatic hyponatraemia due to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion following minor surgery. A rare case of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion occurring after minor surgery is presented. A ten-year-old, previously healthy boy underwent general anaesthesia for detorsion and right orchiopexy. Throughout the operations, which lasted for one hour, he received 120 ml Ringer's lactate solution. The immediate postoperative period was uneventful. Twenty-two hours postoperatively he was found unconscious with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Simultaneously obtained serum sodium concentration (121 mEq.L-1) serum osmolarity (265 mEq.L-1), urine sodium concentration (87 mEq.L-1) and urine osmolarity (525 mEq.L-1) suggested inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion which was confirmed by an elevated serum arginine-vasopressin (AVP) level of 14.5 pcg.ml-1 (normal 1-5 pcg.ml-1) measured by radioimmune assay. He was treated with a single iv dose of 30 mg furosemide and fluid restriction, which produced a gradual increase of his serum sodium concentration to normal within two days. He was well during the remainder of his hospitalization. \nEpidemiology of colonic symptoms and the irritable bowel syndrome. Functional gastrointestinal disease is believed to be very common, but reports of its prevalence have not usually evaluated random community samples, and validated questionnaires have not been used to elicit symptoms. The prevalence of specific colonic symptoms and the irritable bowel syndrome among representative middle-aged whites was determined from a defined population, and the impact of these symptoms on presentation for medical care was measured. An age- and sex-stratified random sample of 1021 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, aged 30-64 years, was obtained. All subjects were mailed a valid self-report questionnaire that identified gastrointestinal symptoms and functional gastrointestinal disorders. The response rate was 82% (n = 835). The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of abdominal pain (more than six times in the prior year) was 26.2 per 100 (95% confidence interval, 23.1-29.2). The prevalence of chronic constipation (hard stools and straining and/or less than 3 stools per week greater than 25% of the time) was 17.4 (95% confidence interval, 14.8-20.0), whereas the prevalence of chronic diarrhea (loose watery stools, and/or greater than 3 stools per day greater than 25% of the time) was 17.9 (95% confidence interval, 15.3-20.5). The prevalence of abdominal pain and disturbed defecation was similar in women and men, except that infrequent defecation and straining at stool were more common in women. Using the Manning symptom criteria to identify irritable bowel syndrome (greater than or equal to 2 of 6 symptoms in those with abdominal pain more than six times in the prior year), the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome was 17.0 per 100 (95% confidence interval, 14.4-19.6). Overall, 71 persons (9%) reported visiting a physician for abdominal pain or disturbed defecation in the prior year; a subset of variables related to pain severity were the best predictors of health care seeking after adjustment for age and gender. However, these accounted for only 22% of the log likelihood. In conclusion, more than one third of an unselected middle-aged population reported chronic abdominal pain or disturbed defecation, and more than one in six had symptoms compatible with the irritable bowel syndrome. Only a minority had presented for medical evaluation; moreover, the characteristics of the abdominal complaints did not explain the seeking of health care in most cases. \nHypoprothrombinemia and hemorrhage in a surgical patient treated with cefotetan. For 4 days before surgical repair of a diverticulitic colovesical fistula and for 6 days after, a 63-year-old man was treated with 2 g of intravenous cefotetan disodium every 12 hours for associated urosepsis with bacteremia. Postoperatively, the patient followed a diet of intravenous nutrition only. Uneventful convalescence was interrupted by signs of sudden major blood loss, accompanied by prolonged prothrombin time. After stabilization with packed red blood cells, fresh plasma, crystalloids, and parenteral vitamin K, laparotomy revealed a huge intra-abdominal clot, which was evacuated. This case illustrates the risk of unexpected hypoprothrombinemia and hemorrhage in a cefotetan-treated surgical patient who demonstrated none of the usual comorbid conditions generally described in patients with antibiotic-induced hypoprothrombinemia. Like cefamandole nafate, cefoperazone sodium, moxalactam disodium, and other cephalosporins containing the methylthiotetrazole side chain, cefotetan appears to pose an unusual risk of major bleeding. \nSticks and stones may break my bones ... reasoning about illness causality and body functioning in children who have a chronic illness. Children's concepts about illness causality and bodily functioning change in a predictable way with advancing age. Differences in the understanding of these concepts in healthy children vs children with a chronic illness have not been clearly delineated. This study included 49 children with a seizure disorder, 47 children with an orthopaedic condition, and 96 healthy children, all with normal intelligence and ranging in age from 5 to 16 years. It demonstrates systematic differences in children's general reasoning skills and in their understanding of concepts about illness causality and bodily functioning, as a function of their age and experience of illness. At all ages, children who had a condition with orthopaedic involvement reported less sophisticated general reasoning and concepts about illness than did healthy children; children with a seizure disorder reported similar general reasoning skills to those of healthy children, but considerably less sophisticated concepts about illness. Children's concepts about body functioning did not differ as a function of the presence of a chronic illness. When their different levels of general cognitive reasoning were statistically controlled, children with a chronic illness had somewhat more sophisticated concepts about bodily functioning than did healthy children. Differences in conceptual development among children with different types of illnesses lead to interesting speculations with regard to the effects of particular illness characteristics on children's cognitive development. \nWolf blade plate ankle arthrodesis. Fifteen patients, each of whom had a Wolf blade plate ankle arthrodesis, were followed for a mean of 56 months. The mean age at the time of operation was 46.7 years. The preoperative diagnosis was posttraumatic arthritis in 16 cases and one each of degenerative arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and avascular necrosis of the talus. Eighteen of the 19 cases fused for a fusion rate of 94.7%. The average fusion position was 2.9 degrees of plantar flexion and 5 degrees of valgus. All patients whose ankle fused were satisfied with their results. The average Mazur postoperative score was 75 (range, 33-91). Five patients had delayed wound healing. The Wolf blade plate is a simple and easy method to fuse the ankle. Minimal dissection is required and a fusion rate of 95% is obtainable. \nEpiglottic laryngoplasty after hemilaryngectomy for glottic cancer. Epiglottic laryngoplasty is technically feasible as a one-stage procedure with excellent functional results. Although the Kambic-Sedlacek-Tucker (K-S-T) technique of glottic reconstruction offers early extubation with an adequate airway, a subsequent wide neoglottis may increase the chance of aspiration and a poor voice. To better restore the laryngeal functions of closure and phonation, we made some modifications on the original K-S-T technique as follows: (1) One of the lateral margins of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic fold is sutured to the arytenoid region of the cricoid rather than a thyroid cartilage remnant. A neo-arytenoid is formed. (2) The other lateral margin of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic fold is sutured to the cut edge of the false and true cord instead of a thyroid ala remnant. Therefore both margins of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic folds are lowered as much as possible to the level of the glottis. A new pseudocord is formed. (3) A cartilage cut is made at the anterior aspect of the epiglottis, leaving its laryngeal surface of mucoperichondrial intact. A new anterior commissure with a sharp angle is shaped by this maneuver. Nineteen hemilaryngectomies with modified epiglottic laryngoplasty have been performed by members of the Department of Otolaryngology of Guangxi Medical College since 1984. Results in this series are fairly good and indicate that the modified epiglottic laryngoplasty is effective in enhancing functional results in terms of respiration, deglutition, and phonation. \nSelective chemical vestibulectomy: preliminary results with human application. The involved membranous labyrinth of patients with medically intractable Meniere's disease is being accessed by means of a fenestration of the bony horizontal semicircular canal in preparation for the application of a 125 or 250 mcg flake of solid streptomycin. Sensory information originating in the affected vestibular end organ is selectively blocked from reaching the central nervous system. This uniformly results in the rapid elimination of vertiginous symptoms, and at these calculated doses yields preservation of (or in some cases improvement in) preoperative cochlear thresholds. The rationale for this procedure, as detailed in earlier investigations of animals, will be briefly reviewed before highlighting our preliminary results in adult clinical trials. \nAcute twin-twin transfusion: a possible mechanism for brain-damaged survivors after intrauterine death of a monochorionic twin. Intrauterine death of one twin in monochorionic pregnancies is associated with increased mortality and morbidity for the survivor. This has been attributed to the consequences of intrauterine disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) initiated by the dead twin. We describe a case in which the fetal cerebral and renal lesions typically found in survivors occurred without any derangement in coagulation. Instead, acute twin-twin transfusion was suggested by the presence of severe anemia in the surviving fetus at delivery. We suggest that the lesions frequently found in the survivors are often due to acute hemodynamic and ischemic changes resulting from acute twin-twin transfusion at the time of intrauterine death, rather than to late-onset DIC. This hypothesis has an important implication for future management: Intervention must occur before intrauterine death if neurologic sequelae in the survivor are to be prevented. \nPriming by platelet-activating factor of endotoxin-induced lung injury and cardiovascular shock. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a glycerophospholipid known for its unusual potent vasoactive and proinflammatory activities. The present study examined whether PAF might serve as a priming factor in endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) synthesis, cardiovascular shock, and lung injury in anesthetized rats. Intravenous infusion of PAF (1 pmol/kg/min for 60 minutes, n = 5) alone or endotoxin (0.1 micrograms/kg i.v. bolus, n = 5) failed to alter blood pressure, serum TNF alpha and thromboxane B2, platelet and leukocyte count, and hematocrit, nor was lung histology, myeloperoxidase activity, and water content changed. In contrast, the combined administration of PAF and endotoxin markedly elevated serum TNF alpha (1,359 +/- 362 pg/ml, n = 5, p less than 0.01) and thromboxane B2 (43 +/- 5 pg/100 microliters, n = 8, p less than 0.01) along with hypotension, hemoconcentration, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Most notably, the combined regimen caused neutrophil aggregation, adhesion, and accumulation into the lung parenchyma along with platelet-fibrin deposits in postcapillary venules, pulmonary edema, and increased lung myeloperoxidase activity. The role of PAF in this process was confirmed by 1) the prevention of the priming effect by pretreatment with the PAF antagonist BN 50739 (n = 5), and 2) the failure of lyso-PAF, the cardinal nonactive PAF-metabolite, to prime for endotoxin-induced production of TNF alpha (n = 4). These data suggest that PAF could serve as a key mediator in priming for endotoxin-induced tissue injury, especially the typical pulmonary pathophysiology of adult respiratory distress syndrome, a severe pathological outcome of septic shock, burns, and multiple organ injury. \nAlterations in proteoglycan synthesis common to healing wounds and tumors. Wound healing and tumor stroma generation share several important properties, including hyperpermeable blood vessels, extravasation of fibrinogen, and extravascular clotting. In both, the deposits of fibrin gel serve initially as provisional stroma and later are replaced by granulation tissue. Proteoglycans (PG) are also important constituents of the extracellular matrix, but their composition and role in healing wounds and tumor stroma generation are poorly understood. The authors used immunohistochemical and biochemical methods to investigate the dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (DSPG) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) composition of healing skin wounds and solid tumors. By immunohistochemistry, the great majority of normal guinea pig and human dermis stained weakly for CSPG and strongly for decorin. In contrast, the granulation tissue of healing skin wounds and scars stained intensely for CSPG and weakly or not at all for decorin; however decorin staining was restored to normal intensity after digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase, suggesting that decorin antigenic sites had been masked by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Like wounds, the stroma of several carcinomas (line 1 guinea pig, human breast, colon, basal cell, and squamous) stained strongly for CSPG and weakly or not at all for decorin, but decorin staining developed after chondroitin ABC lyase digestion. Thus healing wounds and tumor stroma express a common pattern of altered PG staining, adding another to the properties these pathologic entities share. Proteoglycans extracted from healing wounds after in situ labelling with [35S] Na sulfate contained more CSPG than normal dermis with significantly longer GAG chains. Granulation tissue also synthesized more DSPG than normal skin, with greater heterogeneity and longer GAG chains. These alterations in PG synthesis correlate with the cell proliferation, migration, and collagen synthesis that accompany wound healing and may provide clues to the mechanisms responsible for both wound healing and tumor stroma generation. \nIncidence of gallstones in liver cirrhosis. We conducted a longitudinal follow-up of 72 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) in order to assess gallstone (GS) incidence. The period of survey was 24.5 +/- 12.2 months. Patients were divided into two groups: group I--26 patients with ascites at the start or appearing during follow-up, and Group II--46 patients with compensated LC (no ascites) throughout the survey. During follow-up, 12 of 72 (16.6%) patients developed GS. The global cumulative incidence of GS was 5.5 cases/100 people/year. Age and sex had no influence on the incidence of GS in LC; neither had etiology or cirrhosis. On the contrary, the study revealed a significant increase in the incidence of GS in decompensated cirrhosis. In group I patients, GS appeared more frequently (34.6%) than in group II patients (6.5%) (chi 2 9.479; p less than 0.002). The cumulative incidence of GS was five times higher in decompensated versus compensated LC. \nMycosis fungoides: cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [published erratum appears in Am Fam Physician 1991 Jun;43(6):1954] Most patients with mycosis fungoides are between 40 and 60 years of age. The disease has three clinical stages: (1) the premycotic, or patch, stage, consisting of macular, scaling, faint pink to red pruritic patches, usually on unexposed surfaces; (2) the mycotic, or plaque, stage, consisting of reddish, purple-brown plaques, often annular in shape and symmetric in distribution, and (3) the tumor stage, consisting of red-brown to violaceous, dome-shaped, firm tumors with a predilection for the face and body folds. The Sezary syndrome is a leukemic variant. Treatment depends on the extent of disease and includes topical or systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy and psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet light therapy. \nFatal rupture of the intracranial carotid artery during transluminal angioplasty for vasospasm induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage. Case report. The authors report the clinical course, radiographic findings, and gross and microscopic pathology of a patient with fatal rupture of the supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery during transluminal angioplasty for subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm. The rupture most likely resulted from a small portion of aneurysm neck which remained unclipped, thereby leaving an area of structural weakness in the arterial wall at the site of clipping. The area of structural weakness predisposed the artery to rupture upon the addition of transmural pressure induced by balloon inflation during transluminal angioplasty. Caution is advised when performing transluminal angioplasty in the region of aneurysm clipping since the vessel lumen \"recreated\" during the clipping procedure may contain some residual and structurally incomplete aneurysm neck in the vessel wall. \nSelective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization Obstruction of the uterine (proximal) end of the fallopian tube is noted on up to 20% of hysterosalpingograms and has a variety of underlying causes. Definitive diagnosis and treatment in the past have required laparoscopy or laparotomy with tubal resection. Selective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization with fluoroscopically guided catheters has emerged as an improved method both for diagnosis and treatment in these patients. Technical success rates for overcoming the obstruction and visualizing distal tubal anatomy range from 76% to 95%. Pregnancy rates after the procedure vary depending on the patient populations studied; however, early results indicate a greater than 50% intrauterine pregnancy rate by 1 year. The rate of ectopic pregnancy is approximately 10% and that of early tubal reocclusion is less than 30%. Selective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization is recommended as the first intervention in patients with obstruction of the proximal fallopian tube. \nDistribution of BCA-225 in adenocarcinomas. An immunohistochemical study of 446 cases. BCA-225 is a glycoprotein identified in human breast carcinoma cells that has been reported to show a restricted distribution in other human tissues. To further define the presence of BCA-225 in human carcinomas, the authors performed an immunohistochemical study, applying a commercially available monoclonal antibody to BCA-225 to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 446 adenocarcinomas from a variety of sites. BCA-225 expression was found to be common in adenocarcinomas of the breast (98%), kidney (94%), ovary (80%), and lung (74%) but was infrequent in adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (10-16%). Adenocarcinomas of the prostate, bile ducts, thyroid, endometrium, endocervix, and pancreas showed an intermediate frequency of BCA-225 expression (36-68%). Although rare tumor cells in three hepatocellular carcinomas showed reactivity for BCA-225, staining of more than 10% of the tumor cells was not seen in any of the 23 hepatocellular carcinomas that were studied. The authors conclude that BCA-225 is expressed commonly in human adenocarcinomas and that it is not a breast-specific antigen. Antibodies to BCA-225 may have utility in helping one to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma in certain clinical settings. \nCarotid endarterectomy in a community hospital: a change in physicians' practice patterns. A total of 243 consecutive carotid endarterectomies (CEA) performed at Providence Medical Center in Portland, Oregon, were retrospectively reviewed over a 22-month period. Of these, 137 patients (56%) underwent CEA for asymptomatic disease, 52 (37%) of whom had stenotic lesions of 79% or less. There were 6 deaths (3%) and 12 strokes (5%). Four strokes were in asymptomatic patients. These data prompted development of criteria for CEA: (1) hemisphere-specific transient ischemic attacks, reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, or amaurosis fugax with an appropriate carotid lesion; (2) completed stroke with major recovery and significant carotid stenosis; (3) asymptomatic lesion with greater than 80% stenosis (D+) either by carotid arteriogram or non-invasive lab evaluation; and (4) other indications only with a supporting second opinion from a disinterested vascular surgeon, neurosurgeon or neurologist. A prospective review followed institution of the guidelines. In 21 months, 148 operations were performed, a 36% reduction over the initial study period. Of these, 46 (31%) were for asymptomatic lesions. Two patients (4%) did not fulfill the guideline criteria. There were six strokes (4%) and no deaths. The reduction of CEAs appears to be related to a significant decrease in \"inappropriate\" operations being performed. Surgeons' familiarity with the data rather than external pressures seems to be the major factor in changing practice patterns. The decrease in stroke/death rate is not statistically significant. \nTranscutaneous oxygen tensions in assessing the treatment of healed venous ulcers Transcutaneous oxygen tension (Ptc,O2) was assessed as an indicator of risk of reulceration in 68 limbs with healed venous ulcers. Ptc,O2 was also used to assess two methods of ulcer prophylaxis. Measurements were made over the gaiter skin, the healed ulcer and the upper arm. The results were expressed as a ratio of the lower limb readings over those taken from the arm. Patients were randomized, after the ulcer had healed, to elastic stockings and stanozolol, or elastic stockings and surgical ligation of incompetent superficial veins. Patients who declined to participate in the study were prescribed elastic stockings only. Those limbs remaining healed at 12 months had Ptc,O2 ratios remeasured. The Ptc,O2 ratios from limbs that reulcerated were not significantly lower than those from limbs remaining healed. The Ptc,O2 ratio was significantly increased in limbs treated by stanozolol and elastic stockings (P less than 0.05) and by surgery and elastic stockings (P less than 0.05). There was no significant increase in Ptc,O2 in limbs treated by elastic stockings alone. In those treated by surgery and elastic stockings, there was a significant improvement in limbs with normal deep veins (P less than 0.01), but not in limbs with post-thrombotic changes on ascending phlebography. Although these two methods of ulcer prophylaxis improve the Ptc,O2 ratio, a high ratio has not been shown to be beneficial in preventing ulcer recurrence. \nImproving compliance in an inner-city hypertensive patient population. Because hypertension is a \"silent\" disease process, compliance with therapy is always a problem. In the inner city, where socioeconomic factors such as poverty, illiteracy, and substance abuse raise additional barriers to effective health care, poor compliance with antihypertensive regimens can reach epidemic proportions--as it did in our clinic in the early 1970s. After identifying the major causes of poor compliance in our patients, we instituted measures that led directly to greatly improved compliance and control, among them the expansion of clinic hours, the expediting of laboratory services, and the training of nurse-therapists to assume many of the responsibilities of running the clinic. In recent years a number of new antihypertensive agents have been introduced, and these new drugs have afforded patients better blood pressure control through less complex drug regimens with fewer serious side effects. Indeed, we observed a strong correlation between patient compliance and the administration of agents with longer dosing intervals and improved side effects profiles. This observation led us to consider whether transdermal clonidine--which requires weekly, rather than daily, administration--might not be an especially effective means of controlling blood pressure in inner-city patients. To test this hypothesis, we enrolled 20 patients, all of them blacks, in a pilot study of this unique delivery system. Blood pressure was adequately controlled in all 18 patients who completed the study, and patients were uniformly enthusiastic about this alternative to daily dosing. As a result, compliance with this mode of therapy was excellent. \nCardioreparative effects of lisinopril in rats with genetic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. BACKGROUND. In genetic and acquired hypertension, a structural remodeling of the nonmyocyte compartment of the myocardium, including the accumulation of fibrillar collagen within the interstitium and adventitia of intramyocardial coronary arteries and a medial thickening of these vessels, represents a determinant of pathological hypertrophy that leads to ventricular dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS. To evaluate the benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in reversing this interstitial and vascular remodeling in the rat with genetic spontaneous hypertension (SHR) and established left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), we treated 14-week-old male SHR with oral lisinopril (average dose, 15 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Myocardial stiffness and coronary vascular reserve to adenosine (800 micrograms/min) were examined in the isolated heart; myocardial collagen and intramural coronary artery architecture were analyzed morphometrically. In lisinopril-treated SHR compared with 14-week-old baseline or 26-week-old untreated SHR and age- and sex-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls, we found 1) a regression in LVH and normalization of blood pressure, 2) a complete regression of interstitial fibrosis, represented by a decrease of interstitial collagen volume fraction from 7.0 +/- 1.3% to 3.2 +/- 0.3% (p less than 0.025; WKY, 2.8 +/- 0.5%), 3) normalization of myocardial stiffness constant from 19.5 +/- 0.9 to 13.7 +/- 1.3 (p less than 0.025; WKY, 13.8 +/- 2.2), 4) a reversal of intramural coronary artery remodeling, including a decrease in the ratio of perivascular fibrosis to vessel lumen size from 1.4 +/- 0.2 to 0.4 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.025; WKY, 0.6 +/- 0.1) and medial thickening from 12.3 +/- 0.6 to 7.4 +/- 0.5 microns (p less than 0.005; WKY, 7.4 +/- 0.4 microns), and 4) a restoration of coronary vasodilator response to adenosine from 12.3 +/- 0.9 to 26.0 +/- 1.4 ml/min/g (p less than 0.005; WKY, 21.8 +/- 2.2 ml/min/g). Thus, in SHR with LVH and adverse structural remodeling of the cardiac interstitium, lisinopril reversed fibrous tissue accumulation and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries and restored myocardial stiffness and coronary vascular reserve to normal. CONCLUSIONS. These cardioreparative properties of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may be valuable in reversing left ventricular dysfunction in hypertensive heart disease. \nFetal akinesia deformation sequence (Pena-Shokeir phenotype) associated with acquired intrauterine brain damage. An infant with Pena-Shokeir phenotype was born to a cocaine-using mother. The pathologic findings included polyhydramnios, facial anomalies, arthrogryposis, camptodactyly, pulmonary hypoplasia, and tetralogy of Fallot. The neuropathologic findings were diffuse brainstem and spinal cord neuronal degeneration and focal cerebral infarction, consistent with acquired intrauterine ischemic damage. \nDiagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct: usefulness of lymphangiography and CT. The usefulness of lymphangiography and CT in the diagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct was evaluated in 12 patients with chylothorax or chylous ascites after surgery. Bipedal lymphangiography was performed in all 12 patients. The last four patients studied also had CT after lymphangiography. Seven patients had abnormal findings on lymphangiograms; five with leaks from the thoracic duct, one with a lymphocele in a nephrectomy bed, and one with obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels after thoracotomy. Five patients had no evidence of lymphatic leakage. CT in one patient with evidence of a leak on lymphangiography showed extravasation of contrast medium into the mediastinum and pleural space. CT in three patients with no abnormalities on lymphangiography also showed no abnormalities. Four of the five thoracic duct lacerations and the lymphocele were confirmed surgically. The diagnosis of obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels was supported clinically. Four of the five patients with normal findings on lymphangiograms had resolution of their pleural effusions and no evidence of recurrence during a follow-up period of 1-27 months. One patient with normal findings on lymphangiography had an alternative diagnosis established at surgery. Laceration of the thoracic duct was accurately diagnosed and localized with lymphangiography, which allowed definitive surgical repair. CT was of little additional value in diagnosing these injuries. \nBacterial infection and peripheral vascular disease. Whole blood filterability was monitored in 16 nondiabetic peripheral vascular disease (PVD) patients within forty-eight hours of onset of bacterial infection, after ten to seventeen days antibiotic therapy and again, ten days later, after convalescence. The whole blood filterability rate was constantly disturbed before infection in these patients; the impairment worsened significantly (as was expected during infection), but after convalescence the whole blood filterability rate did not return to preinfection levels. This further significant impairment in whole blood filterability was inversely correlated with a reduction in the patients' pain-free walking time as determined by a standard treadmell test performed after convalescence and compared with their average times before infection. \nIntra-ocular pressure variations during extracorporeal circulation and some influencing factors. Intra-ocular pressure (IOP) variations during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and some influencing factors were studied prospectively in 38 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. IOPs were measured pre-operatively, during ECC (after 5 min, 10 min, 25 min and every 15 min thereafter), and on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd postoperative days. IOP, haematocrit, arterial perfusion pressure, partial O2 pressure, partial CO2 pressure, pH and blood bicarbonate levels were measured simultaneously. After the beginning of ECC, arterial perfusion pressure and haematocrit values decreased suddenly, while IOP raised immediately. Sudden increase of blood volume in the beginning of ECC can be the probable cause of IOP elevation. Afterwards, IOP levels decreased to pre-ECC levels. We think that the drop is due to the effect of mannitol in the priming solution and hyposecretion of aqueous humour due to insufficient nutrition-oxygenation of corpus ciliaris after haemodynamic stabilization. \nCost-effectiveness of prophylaxis in total hip replacement. A theoretical analysis was performed regarding the cost-effectiveness in terms of lives saved (reduction of fatal pulmonary embolism [PE]) and in terms of money (dollars spent for prevention and treatment) of seven strategies in the management of venous thromboembolic disease in patients over 39 years of age undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR). Strikingly, this theoretical analysis suggests that low-dose warfarin combined with clinical surveillance of deep vein thrombosis would reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 20 per 1,000 patients to 4 per 1,000 patients and simultaneously reduce the charges for venous thromboembolic disease from $550,000 to about $400,000 per 1,000 patients. Based on this analysis, we strongly recommend this measure on a routine basis. Adding venography or duplex sonography routinely to this prophylactic regimen would, in this theoretical analysis, reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 4 per 1,000 patients to 0.15 per 1,000, but adds charges of $200,000 per extra life saved in the case of routine venography and $50,000 in the case of routine sonography. Low-dose warfarin prophylaxis combined with routine sonography does not generate more charges than no prophylaxis with no screening while drastically reducing the incidence of fatal PE from 20 to 0.3 per 1,000 patients. Where duplex sonography is not easily available, a 12-week postoperative course of low-dose warfarin for every patient with no routine screening will be efficacious in reducing fatal PE and as cost-effective. \nTreatment of pancreatic pseudocysts with octreotide. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common and painful complication of chronic pancreatitis. Seven patients (six male, one female; mean age 49.9 years) with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts and persistent pain were treated with the pancreatic anti-secretory drug octreotide for 2 weeks. Octreotide caused no notable changes in the size of the pseudocysts of three patients. In the remaining four patients, the pseudocysts decreased in size by a mean of 42% (range 29-52%), and pain disappeared completely. These findings suggest a role for octreotide in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. \nA simple radiologic method to estimate the quantity of bowel gas. Patients with functional bowel disorders frequently complain of bloating and abdominal pain, but no practical method is available to measure intestinal gas objectively. To evaluate a new technique, we evaluated 54 abdominal radiographs from 19 patients. A gastroenterologist and a radiologist independently outlined the intestinal gas bubbles in these films. Areas of gas bubbles were measured with a computer digitizing board. Bowel gas was also measured in 24 healthy controls, and in five emergency room patients, supine and erect radiographs were compared to evaluate the effects of position on bowel gas patterns. The two evaluators agreed well on the measured areas of bowel gas (r = 0.96), showing that this is a reliable method. Bowel gas was significantly greater in patients than in controls but did not correlate with symptoms. Bowel gas was significantly greater in supine than upright films, showing that the position of the patient must be standardized. \nPrimary angiosarcoma of adrenal gland presenting as paraneoplastic syndrome: case report. Angiosarcoma is an uncommon neoplasm that rarely involves the adrenal gland. We report on a patient with primary angiosarcoma of the adrenal gland who presented with symptoms best characterized as a paraneoplastic syndrome. \nReversal of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease by inspiratory assistance with a face mask. BACKGROUND. Patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation. We designed, and here report on the efficacy of, a noninvasive ventilatory-assistance apparatus to provide inspiratory-pressure support by means of a face mask. METHODS. We assessed the short-term (45-minute) physiologic effects of the apparatus in 11 patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy in 13 such patients (including 3 of the 11 in the physiologic study) who were treated for several days and compared with 13 matched historical-control patients. RESULTS. In the physiologic study, after 45 minutes of inspiratory positive airway pressure by face mask, the mean (+/- SD) arterial pH rose from 7.31 +/- 0.08 to 7.38 +/- 0.07 (P less than 0.01), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide fell from 68 +/- 17 mm Hg to 55 +/- 15 mm Hg (P less than 0.01), and the partial pressure of oxygen rose from 52 +/- 12 mm Hg to 69 +/- 16 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). These changes were accompanied by marked reductions in respiratory rate (from 31 +/- 7 to 21 +/- 9 breaths per minute, P less than 0.01). Only 1 of the 13 patients treated with inspiratory positive airway pressure needed tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, as compared with 11 of the 13 historical controls (P less than 0.001). Two patients in each group died. As compared with the controls, the treated patients had a more transient need for ventilatory assistance (3 +/- 1 vs. 12 +/- 11 days, P less than 0.01) and a shorter stay in the intensive care unit (7 +/- 3 vs. 19 +/- 13 days, P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. Inspiratory positive airway pressure delivered by a face mask can obviate the need for conventional mechanical ventilation in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \nOcclusive peripheral vascular disease: a multicenter trial of fluorescence-guided, pulsed dye laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. Fluorescence-guided, laser-assisted balloon angioplasty was performed in 129 patients with iliac and femoropopliteal artery chronic occlusions (range, 0.5-50.0 cm; mean length, 9.9 cm) after failure of recanalization with standard guide-wire techniques. Laser recanalization and short-term angiographic success were achieved in 101 (72%) and 95 (68%) of 140 occlusions, respectively. Laser and balloon angioplasty failures were encountered in heavily calcified plaques or after perforations and dissections. Complications included perforations (19%), hematomas (5%), thromboses (4%), and distal embolizations (4%). Real-time fluorescence spectroscopy identified thrombus, white fibrous plaque, and media but could not avoid perforations in many cases because laser wire advancement outdistanced fluorescence sensing. Disruption of tissue by means of pressure transients and/or mechanical advancement occurred in at least 36% of lesions where the laser energy was insufficient (less than 0.4 J/cm) to ablate significant tissue. Integration of fluorescence guidance with pulsed dye laser ablation is feasible, but additional refinements are necessary to increase safety and efficacy. \nPredicting chemically induced duodenal ulcer and adrenal necrosis with classification trees. Binary tree-structured statistical classification algorithms and properties of 56 model alkyl nucleophiles were brought to bear on two problems of experimental pharmacology and toxicology. Each rat of a learning sample of 745 was administered one compound and autopsied to determine the presence of duodenal ulcer or adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis. The cited statistical classification schemes were then applied to these outcomes and 67 features of the compounds to ascertain those characteristics that are associated with biologic activity. For predicting duodenal ulceration, dipole moment, melting point, and solubility in octanol are particularly important, while for predicting adrenal necrosis, important features include the number of sulfhydryl groups and double bonds. These methods may constitute inexpensive but powerful ways to screen untested compounds for possible organ-specific toxicity. Mechanisms for the etiology and pathogenesis of the duodenal and adrenal lesions are suggested, as are additional avenues for drug design. \nTherapeutic defibrination with ancrod does not protect canine myocardium from reperfusion injury. The purpose of this study was to determine whether normal fibrinogen contributes to the development of myocardial reperfusion injury by acting as a substrate in vivo for neutrophil adhesion. This was tested in a dog model of acute myocardial infarction that used pentobarbital anesthetized dogs subjected to 90 min regional myocardial ischemia and 5 h reperfusion. Dogs were treated with 1 unit/kg Ancrod (venom from the Malayan pit viper, Agkistrodon rhodostoma) or vehicle i.v. 60 min after left circumflex coronary artery occlusion. Therapeutic defibrination was verified in Ancrod-treated dogs by measurements of clottable fibrinogen, alpha-2 antiplasmin and plasminogen, by the activated partial thromboplastin time and by immunoelectrophoresis. Fibrinogen was depleted to below detectable limits of the assay (less than 0.05 mg/ml) after treatment with Ancrod. The defibrination effect was accomplished by the expected activation of the fibrinolytic system: alpha-2 antiplasmin was decreased by 10% and plasminogen activity was decreased by 30% with Ancrod treatment. There were no measureable differences between the two treatment groups in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, rate pressure product or circumflex coronary blood flow throughout the 90 min of regional ischemia or during the 5 h of reperfusion. The relative severity of ischemia between the two treatment groups was similar when assessed with radiolabeled microsphere measurement of myocardial blood flow. The accumulation of neutrophils (measured by myeloperoxidase activity) within the myocardium after reperfusion was not reduced by prior depletion of fibrinogen. \nForeign body in the gastrointestinal tract: intraluminal migration of laparotomy sponge. We have reported a case of complete transluminal migration of a retained laparotomy sponge that caused repeated partial small bowel obstruction. Diagnosis was made when roentgenograms showed multiple positions of the laparotomy marker. The sponge was surgically removed. This is the 69th reported case of complete transluminal migration and distal movement of a laparotomy sponge. \nCeftazidime as monotherapy or combined with teicoplanin for initial empiric treatment of presumed bacteremia in febrile granulocytopenic patients. In a prospective randomized study, 120 febrile, granulocytopenic patients received as initial therapy ceftazidime with or without teicoplanin. At the onset of fever, patients had no obvious infectious focus. For 103 assessable episodes, initial bacteremias were detected in 18 of 51 patients (35%) given ceftazidime and 20 of 52 patients (38%) given the combination; 13 and 17 bacteremias caused by gram-positive bacteria occurred in these groups, respectively. There was no difference in terms of the final response (25 of 51 patients [49%] treated with ceftazidime alone versus 33 of 52 patients [63%] given the combination), and the morbidity was comparable for both treatment groups. The duration of fever and of total antibiotic therapy were similar in both groups. Initial therapy was modified in 26 patients (51%) treated with ceftazidime, with 20 surviving the infection, and in 19 patients (37%) treated with the combination, with 15 surviving. Persistent fever was the main reason for changing treatment, and no patient died of a gram-positive infection. Subsequent infective events occurred in 16 patients (31%) given ceftazidime and in 25 patients (48%) given the combination. Lung infiltrates developed in 12 and 13 patients, respectively, but more new infections occurred in the combination group. Allergic skin reactions were also more frequent in this group. Thus, while teicoplanin provides simple, reliable, and safe treatment of patients with presumed gram-positive infections, it is not useful when given empirically to this patient population, and treatment may result in more infective complications and adverse events. \nPulmonary mass and air meniscus sign in a 19-year-old man. Sacrococcygeal teratoma is rarely diagnosed in adults. Pulmonary mass as the presenting clinical form of the malignant variety of this germ-cell tumor is exceptional. We report herein such a case with the noticeable peculiarity of showing the air meniscus sign on chest roentgenographic examination. \nOccult papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid--a potential pitfall of fine needle aspiration cytology? The use of fine needle aspiration cytology detected papillary carcinoma in two patients with multinodular goitre measuring 0.7 cm and 0.9 cm in diameter, respectively. Like most of the cases from previous large series, the tumours progressed slowly as shown by absence of enlarged glands on surgical exploration and no clinical signs of metastasis after two and five years of follow up. This study shows that aspiration cytology can detect a virtually harmless occult papillary carcinoma that will oblige patients to have surgery. This very occasional \"pitfall\" of fine needle aspiration should not preclude this well known beneficial method from being used in the management of thyroid disease. \nThe risk of axillofemoral bypass grafting for acute vascular occlusion. The hypothesis of the present study is that axillofemoral bypass grafting for acute vascular occlusion has results significantly inferior to an elective procedure. We reviewed 53 patients undergoing primary axillofemoral bypass grafting at the University of Virginia from 1984 to 1989. We found that patients who were admitted with acute vascular occlusion had a higher incidence of perioperative complications (63% vs 26%, p = 0.001), perioperative mortality (26% vs 3%, p less than 0.05), lower graft patency at 1 year (60% vs 90%, p less than 0.05), lower rate of freedom from reoperation in first year (50% vs 82%, p less than 0.01), and lower rates of limb salvage (76% vs 94%, p less than 0.05) than patients undergoing axillofemoral bypass grafting for chronic symptoms or conditions. These two groups did not differ in any of the other risk factors or perioperative characteristics examined. We conclude axillofemoral bypass grafting performed for indications other than acute vascular occlusion is associated with acceptable morbidity, mortality, graft patency, and limb salvage rates. \nThermographic observations on rats with experimental neuropathic pain. Infrared thermographic images were obtained from the plantar hind paws of rats with an experimental nerve injury that produces signs of neuropathic pain. Thermograms confirmed that the experimental neuropathy produces signs resembling those of patients with neuropathic pain. The hind paws on the nerve-damaged side were abnormally hot, abnormally cold, or apparently normal 8-16 days post injury, a variability that is seen clinically in neuropathic pain patients. Abnormally cold hind paws became warm as soon as the injured sciatic nerve was transected, indicating that the underlying vasoconstriction was mediated by neural impulse activity. Xylazine (Rompun), a sympatho-inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist that normally increases cutaneous temperature, caused the hind paw on the control side to warm, as anticipated, while causing paradoxical cooling of abnormally hot hind paws, and even of 'normal temperature' paws on the nerve-injured side. These findings shed light on possible mechanisms underlying abnormal deviations of skin temperature as a symptom of nerve injury. The findings also attest to the usefulness of the experimental animal model of neuropathic pain and of the thermographic method. \nDuP 753 increases survival in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats fed a high sodium diet. We studied the effects of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DuP 753, on blood pressure, body weight, plasma renin activity, sodium excretion, and mortality in male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp) fed a 4% NaCl diet for 12 weeks. The rise in blood pressure, due to high sodium intake, was blunted in the first 8 weeks of the study in the DuP 753-treated group; however, it started slowly to rise in the following weeks. In the untreated group, blood pressure rose steadily and it was significantly higher than that of the treated group during the whole experimental period. DuP 753-treated rats gained weight continuously during the study in contrast to the untreated group, where weight gain was arrested after 4 weeks. Plasma renin activity rose significantly after 4 weeks of treatment with DuP 753; by week 6 its values returned to baseline values and remained at these lower values until week 12. In the untreated group, plasma renin activity was not suppressed by high sodium intake after 4 weeks; it continued to rise and it was significantly elevated by 8 and 12 weeks. Survival at 12 weeks was 84% in DuP 753-treated group and 26% in the untreated group. The data demonstrate that DuP 753 decreased mortality and dramatically blunted the blood pressure rise in SHRsp fed a high sodium diet. \nCystic cerebellar schwannoma: case report. We report a case of cerebellar schwannoma in a 64-year-old woman. The tumor was defined on computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans and confirmed on surgery. The solid part of the tumor appeared to be derived from the inferior vermis of the cerebellum, the cystic part extending toward the medulla oblongata and the foramen magnum. The problem of preoperative diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging findings is discussed. \nThe value of portable chest roentgenography in adult respiratory distress syndrome. Comparison with computed tomography. In 17 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, we used data derived from computed tomographic (CT) scan densitometric analysis to validate the value of portable chest roentgenograms in objectively estimating the amount of pulmonary edema. Chest roentgenograms and CT scans were taken in the same ventilatory conditions (apnea at 10 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]); blood gas samples and hemodynamic parameters were collected at the same time. Roentgenographic analysis was undertaken by independent observers using two standardized scoring systems proposed in the literature. CT scan analysis was performed using the CT number frequency distribution and the gas lung volume (measured by helium dilution technique) to estimate quantitatively the lung density, the lung weight, and the percentage of normally aerated and nonaerated tissue. Knowing the mean CT number of the pulmonary parenchyma in a group of normal subjects, we also inferred the ideal lung weight expected in the study population and computed the excess tissue mass as the difference between actual and ideal lung weight. Both the roentgenographic scoring systems showed direct correlation with the pulmonary impairment as detected by CT scan densitometric analysis (CT number, percentage of nonaerated tissue, lung weight, and excess tissue mass; p less than 0.01) and inverse relation with the percentage of normally aerated tissue (p less than 0.01). We also found a relationship between roentgenographic scores and the impairment in gas exchange as detected by shunt fraction (p less than 0.05). We conclude that standardized reading of portable chest roentgenograms by means of scoring tables is a valuable tool in estimating the amount of pulmonary edema in a patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome. \nWhich asymptomatic patients should undergo routine screening carotid duplex scan? The benefits of obtaining a routine screening carotid duplex scan have not been established for patients with peripheral vascular disease but no signs or symptoms of carotid artery disease. We retrospectively reviewed all carotid duplex scans (4,000) performed at our institution between 1985 through 1989 and found for analysis 91 scans in 78 patients who underwent a screening duplex scan because of the presence of peripheral vascular disease. Patients with carotid bruits, abnormal carotid pulses, and focal or nonspecific neurologic symptoms were excluded. Thirty-three percent of these patients had carotid stenosis of 16% to 50%, 14% had carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, and 5% had stenosis greater than or equal to 75%. Individual risk factors for atherosclerosis, including elderly age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and a recent or past history of cardiac or vascular surgery, did not predict the detection of high-grade carotid stenosis. However, all 11 of the patients with carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50% were 68 years of age and older, and this age range, in combination with the various risk factors, increased the incidence of significant carotid artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 50%) to as high as 45%. We conclude that routine screening carotid duplex scan is indicated in elderly patients (age greater than or equal to 68 years) with peripheral vascular disease, even in the absence of any signs or symptoms of carotid artery disease, when other atherosclerotic risk factors are present. \nInhibitory effects of the gastrin receptor antagonist (L-365,260) on gastrointestinal tumor cells. A selective gastrin receptor (GR) antagonist, L-365,260 is bound to the GR on AR42J cells with a potency 7.5-fold less than G17 (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] G17, 6 x 10(-9) mol/l; IC50 L365-260, 4.5 x 10(-8) mol/l). G17 is mitogenic for AR42J cells, as assessed by 75Se-selenomethionine uptake and L-365,260 at concentrations of 2.5 x 10(-6) mol/l and 2.5 x 10(-7) mol/l, (55X and 5.5 X the dose required to displace 50% 125I G17, respectively), and reduced optimal G17 stimulated mitogenesis in 75% of experiments. The basal growth of two human colon cancer cell lines, LoVo and C146 was reduced by L-365,260 (2.5 x 10(-7) mol/l) after 5 days of treatment to 44% and 64% of the control, respectively. However, inhibition was followed by a rebound of growth to control levels. The growth of AR42J xenografts in nude mice was increased by administration of G17 (10 micrograms/mouse/d, P less than 0.027). This increase was blocked by coadministration of oral L-365,260 (5 mg/kg/d, P less than 0.034). L-365,260 could be an important therapeutic agent in slowing the growth of GR-positive, G17-sensitive gastrointestinal tumors. \nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis. A quantitative analysis of motion, gait, and femoral remodeling after in situ fixation. A prospective clinical study was done for quantitative examination of motion of the hip, gait, and proximal femoral remodeling after in situ fixation of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. In situ fixation was performed in forty-five consecutively treated patients (fifty-six hips). Thirty-nine (87 per cent) of the patients returned for examination two years after treatment. The greatest percentage of motion of the hip returned within six months after treatment. Despite loss of internal rotation of the hip, the mean foot-progression angle was 10.8 degrees. Radiography and computerized tomographic scanning revealed minimum change in the relationship of the femoral head to the femoral shaft and no change in the neck-shaft angle. Motion returned despite minimum osseous remodeling. The early return of motion (in the first three months) may have been due to relief of pain, spasm, and synovitis, while soft-tissue stretching and resorption of bone in the anterolateral part of the femoral neck may have accounted for the remainder of the increase in internal rotation. \nDissection of the protein kinase cascade by which nerve growth factor activates MAP kinases. Mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPKs) are a family of protein-serine/threonine kinases activated as an early intracellular response to a variety of hormones and growth factors. They are unique in requiring both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation to become active and are the only examples of protein-serine/threonine kinases activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes differentiation of phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cells, which respond by conversion within hours from a chromaffin-like to a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype. NGF stimulation of PC12 cells increases the activity of two protein kinases by greater than 20-fold within minutes, both strikingly similar to MAPKs. They are inactivated by either protein-tyrosine phosphatases or the protein-serine/threonine phosphatase termed protein phosphatase 2A (ref. 8), they activate protein S6 kinase-II (refs 9, 10), and they phosphorylate identical threonine residues on myelin basic protein (our unpublished results) to those phosphorylated by other MAPKs. Immunological data indicate that these protein kinases, termed peak-I and peak-II (Fig. 1a) are probably ERK2 and ERK1, respectively, two widely expressed MAPK isoforms. Here we identify the 'MAP kinase kinases' (MAPKKs) in PC12 cells which are activated by NGF and report that MAPKKs are dependent on serine/threonine phosphorylation for activity and promote phosphorylation of serine/threonine and tyrosine residues on MAPKs. \nAssessment of a daily combined preparation of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide in a controlled trial of three 6-month regimens for smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. Singapore Tuberculosis Service/British Medical Research Council In a study in Singapore 310 patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated at random to daily chemotherapy with streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide (1) for 2 months (2SHRZ), (2) for 1 month (1SHRZ), or (3) for 2 months without streptomycin (2HRZ). This was followed for all patients by three times weekly isoniazid and rifampin to a total duration of 6 months. During the initial period of daily chemotherapy the patients were also allocated at random to be given their HRZ either as a combined formulation (Rifater), each tablet containing 50 mg isoniazid, 120 mg rifampin, and 300 mg pyrazinamide, or as three separate drugs. During the Rifater versus separate drugs comparison the most common spontaneous complaints were of nausea and vomiting, reported by 8% of 155 patients receiving Rifater and 7% of 155 separate drugs. Other adverse effects were also reported in similar proportions in the two series. Among 271 patients with drug-susceptible strains of tubercle bacilli pretreatment there were no bacteriologic failures during chemotherapy. During 18 months of subsequent follow-up bacteriologic relapse occurred in 3 (7%) of 46 2SHRZ, 2 (5%) of 42 1SHRZ, and 3 (8%) of 40 2HRZ patients allocated to Rifater and in 0 of 47 2SHRZ, 1 (2%) of 46 1SHRZ, and 1 (2%) of 44 2HRZ patients allocated to separate drugs. There was no evidence of therapeutic benefit from continuing SHRZ administration beyond 1 month or from adding streptomycin to HRZ. The relapse rates were slightly higher in the Rifater series (p = 0.04). Further follow-up and results from other studies are therefore needed fully to assess the combined preparation. \nHeart rate response during exercise testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring in patients with syndrome X. The response of the heart rate during exercise testing and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring performed with patients not receiving antianginal treatment was assessed in 26 patients (9 men and 17 women; mean age 51 +/- 8 years) with syndrome X (angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries), in 27 patients with coronary artery disease (10 men and 17 women; mean age 55 +/- 9 years), and in 21 healthy subjects (8 men and 13 women; mean age 47 +/- 11 years). In patients with syndrome X the slope of the regression line of heart rate versus time (heart rate/time slope) during exercise testing was similar to that of patients with coronary artery disease (3.3 +/- 0.8 versus 3.1 +/- 1.2 beats/min), but significantly lower than that in healthy subjects (4.2 +/- 1.1 beats/min; p less than 0.003). In patients with syndrome X the intercept of the heart rate/time slope was significantly higher than that in coronary artery disease patients and healthy subjects (102 +/- 15, 86 +/- 18, and 90 +/- 16 beats/min, respectively; p less than 0.015). Resting preexercise heart rate was also significantly higher in syndrome X, compared with coronary artery disease patients and healthy subjects (91 +/- 16, 79 +/- 16, and 80 +/- 14 beats/min, respectively). During ambulatory ECG monitoring, mean diurnal heart rate (from 6 AM to 6 PM) was higher in patients with syndrome X (83 +/- 8 beats/min) than in patients with coronary artery disease (75 +/- 8 beats/min) and healthy subjects (74 +/- 11 beats/min) (p less than 0.02). \nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection among homeless men in a New York City shelter. Association with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence among a selected sample of 169 high-risk homeless men residing in a congregate shelter in New York City, NY, was 62%. Seropositivity for HIV correlated significantly with intravenous drug use (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.4) and active tuberculosis (odds ratio, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.4 to 13.5). Most cases of active tuberculosis were among homeless men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex; and significant CD4 lymphocyte depletion was associated with active tuberculosis. Total time homeless correlated positively with active and latent tuberculosis infection. Compliance rates with return for HIV antibody test results, medications, and follow-up visits were 70%, suggesting a significant degree of knowledge, awareness, and personal concern regarding HIV infection among homeless men; yet 28% of homeless intravenous drug users continue active drug injection, despite HIV infection. Cohabitation in overcrowded congregate dormitories creates a risk of airborne transmission of tuberculosis, which is a common reactivation infection in HIV-seropositive homeless men. Medically appropriate housing should be provided to such homeless persons, and expanded HIV antibody testing, counseling, and medical services on site should be offered to residents of shelters. \nAn eyelash nidus for dacryoliths of the lacrimal excretory and secretory systems. We treated two patients with dacryolithiasis secondary to an eyelash. The first patient underwent dacryocystorhinostomy for a stone within the lacrimal sac. In the second patient the dacryolith was removed from a lacrimal gland ductule. Eyelashes found in the tear film or conjunctival fornices during routine examination should be removed to prevent the possible occurrence of dacryolithiasis. \nCatecholamine responses to histamine infusion in man. To evaluate the effects of histamine-induced hypotension on plasma catecholamine levels, eight normal men, aged 20 to 40 years, were infused with incremental doses of histamine starting at 0.2 microgram/kg/min at a 30 degree tilt position with monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate. Histamine dosage was increased every 5 minutes by 0.1 to 0.2 microgram/kg/min until mean BP fell greater than 15 mm Hg or a dosage of 1.6 micrograms/kg/min was reached. Plasma catecholamine samples were taken between the fourth and fifth minute of each histamine dosage. Identical measurements were made during nitroglycerin-induced hypotension in these subjects. Histamine produced threefold greater increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels than did nitroglycerin for comparable decreases in BP. Although NE levels increased twofold to fivefold from baseline with histamine infusion, epinephrine levels increased minimally at the highest doses or not at all. Our data demonstrate that histamine selectively releases NE from adrenergic nerve terminals without significant adrenal catecholamine release. We suggest that neural NE release plays an important role in the cardiac effects of histamine. \nRadiotherapy of advanced laryngeal cancer using three small fractions daily. Since 1983, we have treated advanced (UICC stages III and IV) squamous carcinomas of the larynx by primary radiotherapy, using three small fractions a day, 3-4 h interfraction interval, 5 days per week. The early patients received doses per fraction of 1.5 Gy, and a total dose of approximately 70 Gy, given as a split-course over 6 to 7 weeks. While overall tumor control and laryngeal preservation was good, a number of severe late radiation reactions were seen. The schedule was then modified, with a reduction in the fraction size to 1.1 Gy, the total dose to 60 Gy, and the overall time to 4 weeks, with omission of the mid-treatment \"split.\" Since 1986, we have treated 26 patients in this way. Acute reactions are brisk, but rapidly healing. Loco-regional control was achieved in 22 patients, only one of whom has relapsed to date, in a solitary node, salvaged by radical neck dissection. Four have died of uncontrolled loco-regional malignancy, and three of intercurrent disease while in clinical remission. No serious late morbidity has been observed in surviving patients, and vocal quality is good in the majority. These results suggest that this hyperfractionated and accelerated radiotherapy schedule may offer an acceptable nonsurgical, voice-preserving treatment for advanced laryngeal carcinoma; it can be used in a normally working radiotherapy department. \nDouble-blind randomized multicenter study comparing Maalox TC tablets and ranitidine in healing of duodenal ulcers. The efficacy of ranitidine 150 mg twice daily and Maalox TC three tablets four times daily were compared in patients with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer. Seventy-nine patients were randomly allocated to double-blind, double-dummy treatment, stratified for smokers. Endoscopy was repeated after four weeks. Those unhealed continued treatment for a further two weeks before final endoscopy. Per protocol analysis in 53 patients showed ulcer healing rates at week 4 and at weeks 4 and 6 combined of 78 and 89% on Maalox TC, and of 81 and 91% on ranitidine, respectively. The same analysis gave overall healing rates of 81% in smokers and 100% in nonsmokers, irrespective of treatment. Both treatments provided early ulcer pain relief. Diarrhea was a commoner side effect in patients on Maalox TC. The study showed Maalox TC and ranitidine were equally effective in healing duodenal ulceration. \nMulticenter trial of prophylaxis with clindamycin plus aztreonam or cefotaxime in gynecologic surgery. A prospective, randomized, multicenter study was conducted on the efficacy and safety of two prophylactic antibiotic regimens in both abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy. Patients received three intravenous doses of clindamycin (900 mg) plus either aztreonam (1 g) or cefotaxime (1 g); the doses were given at the induction of anesthesia and 8 and 16 hours later. A total of 170 patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and 142 patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy completed the trial and were evaluated. Following abdominal hysterectomy infections occurred at the op",
