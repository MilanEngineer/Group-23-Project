        "text": "xygen saturations during the sleep study period. We divided the group with apnea into those with RVH and those without it. Those patients with RVH had a higher AI, longer average apnea time, a greater duration of longest apnea and a lower average oxygen saturation for the period of the sleep study. In addition, those with RVH had a lower average oxygen saturation during each apneic episode with a p value equaling 0.09. \nCarcinoid tumor of the common bile duct: evidence for its origin in metaplastic endocrine cells. Carcinoid tumors of the extrahepatic bile ducts are extremely rare neoplasms. The authors report the case of a 36-yr-old male patient with a carcinoid tumor that arose in the common hepatic bile duct. The non-neoplastic mucosa showed areas of gastric and intestinal metaplasia that included scattered argyrophil endocrine cells. Since the normal mucosa of the bile ducts lacks the latter type of cells, this case provides evidence for the first time that carcinoid tumors of this anatomic site probably originate from metaplastic endocrine cells. \nEmergency laryngectomy. From 1974 to 1990, 31 patients underwent emergency laryngectomy for airway obstruction due to laryngeal carcinoma, in an effort to avoid the complication of stomal recurrence. This group of patients had a greater proportion of multiregional tumours (35 per cent vs 13 per cent) than a comparison group of elective laryngectomies. In other respects the two groups were similar. Early post-operative mortality (6.5 per cent vs 3 per cent), stomal recurrence rates (4.2 per cent vs 4.8 per cent) and survival (53 per cent vs 55 per cent) were not significantly different between the emergency laryngectomy group and the comparison group undergoing elective laryngectomy. \nAn autopsy case of I-cell disease. Ultrastructural and biochemical analyses. An autopsy case of I-cell disease in a 4-year-old Japanese girl is presented. In this report, the authors analyze the relationship between morphologic (including electron microscopic) and biochemical findings. Lymph node, spleen, and kidney, which were stained with Hale's colloidal iron method, contained large amounts of hexosamine. These substances had accumulated in lymphocytes of B-cell lineage. \nLate potentials are unaltered by ventricular filling pressure reduction in heart failure. Exacerbation of heart failure may increase susceptibility to arrhythmias. Therefore tests to assess the risk of arrhythmia, performed after hemodynamic improvement, may be of limited value. To determine whether hemodynamic improvement alters ventricular late potentials detected by signal-averaged ECG, we studied 27 consecutive patients with dilated heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 0.20 +/- 0.06, 15 with coronary artery disease) before and 3 +/- 2 days after tailored vasodilator and diuretic therapy reduced ventricular filling pressures. QRS duration, terminal QRS amplitude (root mean square [RMS]), and low-amplitude (less than 40 microV) signal (LAS) duration were determined by an automated algorithm from the vector magnitude of the QRS high-pass filtered at 25 Hz and at 40 Hz. Despite marked decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge (27 +/- 7 to 16 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and right atrial (13 +/- 7 to 7 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) pressures and a 20% increase in cardiac output, there was not a significant change in QRS duration, RMS, or LAS. Before and after therapy late potentials, defined as abnormal QRS duration RMS, or LAS, were present in 14 (52%) patients with filtering at 25 Hz and in 22 (81%) patients with filtering at 40 Hz. The signal-averaged ECG after hemodynamic improvement predicted the results during exacerbation of heart failure in all patients. Thus in patients with advanced heart failure the signal-averaged ECG obtained after hemodynamic improvement reflects the findings during exacerbation of heart failure. \nThe pediatrician's involvement in prevention and treatment of oral disease in medically compromised children. Significant oral health problems are associated with medical, physical, or mental disorders that occur in children. The pediatrician has the opportunity through early intervention to set the tone for a health care practice that will improve the quality of life for many disadvantaged children. When the pediatrician and pediatric dentist work hand in hand, the children can often expect a happy, healthy future. \nThe physiologic basis of diuretic synergism: its role in treating diuretic resistance. Diuretic drugs usually improve edema when used judiciously. Some patients, however, become resistant to their effects. Diuretic resistance may result from dietary indiscretion, poor compliance, impaired bioavailability, imparied diuretic secretion into the lumen of the renal tubule, or because other drugs interfere with diuretic activity. When easily treatable causes of diuretic resistance have been excluded, resistance often reflects the intensity of the stimuli to sodium retention. Recent experimental work has indicated ways in which the kidney adapts to chronic diuretic treatment and has indicated how these adaptations may limit diuretic effectiveness. First, nephron segments downstream from the site of diuretic action increase sodium-chloride (NaCl) reabsorption because the delivered NaCl load increases. Second, diuretic-induced contraction of the extracellular fluid volume stimulates kidney tubules to retain NaCl until the next dose of diuretic is administered. Third, kidney tubules themselves may become hypertrophic because they are chronically stimulated by diuretic-induced increases in NaCl delivery. These adaptations all increase the rate of NaCl reabsorption and blunt the effectiveness of diuretic therapy. When diuretic resistance is present, using a second diuretic drug that acts in a different nephron segment is often effective. Recent experimental results suggest that a second class of drug may act synergistically with the first by blocking the adaptive processes that limit diuretic effectiveness. On the basis of an understanding of the mechanisms of diuretic adaptation and resistance, treatment regimens can be designed to block specific adaptive mechanisms and to improve diuretic therapy. \nSubstance abuse: the designer drugs. Designer drugs, chemically altered compounds derived from federally controlled substances, have become a major cause of addiction and overdose deaths. These drugs include mescaline analogs, synthetic opioids, arylhexylamines, methaqualone derivatives and crack, a new form of cocaine. Sudden changes in mood, weight loss, depression, disturbed sleep patterns, deteriorating school or work performance, marital problems, and loss of interest in friends and social activities may be signs of drug addiction. Life-threatening complications of acute intoxication, such as hyperthermia, seizures, combative and psychotic behavior, and cardiorespiratory collapse, require prompt diagnosis and supportive intervention. \nDifferential expression of CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor) on lamina propria T cells and macrophages in the intestinal lesions in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis Many interleukin-2 receptor (CD25) bearing cells can be identified by alkaline phosphatase immunohistochemistry in the diseased intestinal lamina propria of children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, but rarely in normal intestine. In both diseases, the CD25+ cells are present as aggregates in the lamina propria below the epithelium, and constitute a large proportion of the lamina propria mononuclear cells. In Crohn's disease, but not ulcerative colitis, CD25+ cells are abundant in the submucosa. The CD25+ cells in Crohn's disease are 58-88% CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, indicating that they are T cells, whereas in ulcerative colitis the CD25+ cells are greater than 80% CD3-, CD4+, HLA-DR+, indicating that they are macrophages. Thus, differential expression of CD25 on T cells and macrophages serves to distinguish the immunologic lesions in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. \nMyonecrosis and myofibrosis as complications of sickle cell anemia. Painful crises in sickle cell anemia are associated with infarction and subsequent fibrosis of many different organs. Myonecrosis secondary to muscle infarction during a crisis and subsequent fibrosis are often not recognized as complications of sickle cell anemia. We describe four patients, all of whom had recurrent episodes of symmetric proximal muscle pain and swelling as prominent features of their crises. Muscle biopsies showed acute myonecrosis with a minimal inflammatory reaction as well as myofibrosis with abundant collagen deposition. Chronic sequelae consisted of muscle induration, atrophy, and contractures. \nSuppression of eicosanoid biosynthesis during coronary angioplasty by fish oil and aspirin. BACKGROUND. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is an acute, localized stimulus to platelet and vascular function. Periprocedural cardiovascular complications are reduced by moderate-dose aspirin (ASA), presumably due to inhibition of thromboxane (TX) A2. METHODS AND RESULTS. Excretion of TXA2 and prostacyclin (PGI2) metabolites in urine increased during PTCA. Pretreatment for 3 days with either moderate- (325 mg/day) or low-dose (80 mg/day) ASA inhibited the increase in both eicosanoids. Pretreatment for 3 weeks with fish oil (10 g/day) only partially suppressed TXA2. Formation of trienoic eicosanoids and accumulation of omega-3 fatty acids in platelet membranes confirmed fish oil ingestion. Although basal PGI2 was not inhibited, the PTCA-related increment was suppressed. CONCLUSIONS. PTCA results in an acute, transient alteration of eicosanoid biosynthesis consistent with accelerated platelet-vascular interactions. Pretreatment for 3 days with moderate or low doses of ASA suppresses TXA to a similar extent during PTCA, and their effects on acute cardiovascular complications of this procedure are likely to be comparable. It is unlikely that even prolonged pretreatment with fish oil can substitute for the platelet inhibitory action of ASA during PTCA. Suppression of PGI2 may contribute to the residual acute periprocedural complication rate in patients taking ASA. \nEtidronate for hypercalcemia of malignancy and osteoporosis. The biphosphonates are becoming well established as effective agents for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases. Etidronate disodium is the only biphosphonate approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Accepted indications for etidronate therapy are symptomatic Paget's disease, heterotopic ossification and hypercalcemia of malignancy. An unapproved, but apparently successful use is treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Both oral and intravenous preparations are available. Newer biphosphonates, which may be more efficacious and less toxic than etidronate, are being studied. \nComparative angiographic quantitative analysis of the immediate efficacy of coronary atherectomy with balloon angioplasty, stenting, and rotational ablation. Interventional cardiology has branched in two directions: devices that primarily dilate coronary stenoses and those that debulk coronary tissue. Presently the optimum coronary intervention has not been found. While patients are awaiting randomized trials, a comparison based on matched quantitative coronary analysis may be useful to evaluate results of new interventional techniques. Therefore we compared 51 patients undergoing atherectomy with individually matched patients who were undergoing balloon angioplasty and stenting. The lesions were matched according to location of stenosis and reference diameter. Atherectomy and stenting resulted in larger gains in minimal luminal diameter compared with conventional balloon angioplasty. The minimal luminal diameter was increased from 1.2 +/- 0.4 mm to 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm in the atherectomy group and from 1.2 +/- 0.3 mm to 1.9 +/- 0.4 mm in the angioplasty group (p less than 0.00001). Atherectomy and stenting resulted in similar gains in minimum luminal diameter (1.4 mm vs 1.3 mm, p = NS). In addition, atherectomy and stenting appear to be more effective in resisting elastic recoil because of tissue removal and an intrinsic dilating effect, respectively. In matched populations directional atherectomy and stenting appear to be more effective intracoronary interventional devices than balloon angioplasty based on the immediate results. However, atherectomy is limited in smaller coronary vessels because of its larger size. \nAdaptive changes in the periphery and their therapeutic consequences. Systemic vasoconstriction in chronic heart failure is due to several compensatory mechanisms with different time courses. Peripheral vasoconstriction mediated by increased sympathetic tone and activation of the plasma renin-angiotensin system may act primarily for short-term control. The effects of the vascular renin-angiotensin system, impaired flow-dependent, endothelium-mediated dilation (resulting from chronically reduced flow) and structural alterations of the vessel wall slowly emerge with time. In addition, fluid retention may contribute to increased vascular stiffness in chronic heart failure. Improved cardiac output with acute administration of vasodilators and inotropes is not immediately translated into increased blood flow to skeletal muscle, because (1) the reversal of the peripheral alterations described develops slowly over time (in fact, vasodilators and inotropes given acutely may cause redistribution of blood flow in skeletal muscle without improving oxygen availability); and (2) intrinsic abnormalities of skeletal muscle exist in chronic heart failure (e.g., due to chronic deconditioning, resulting in reduced oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle, as suggested by ultrastructural analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Drugs that interfere with the underlying compensatory mechanisms (e.g., renin-angiotensin system) without development of tolerance during long-term therapy exert beneficial effects after long-term treatment (e.g., the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are, in part, due to peripheral mechanisms--the inability of the peripheral vessels to dilate--and to improvement of peripheral oxygen extraction). \nExtracorporeal lithotripsy. An important adjunct in the nonoperative management of retained or recurrent bile duct stones. Retained or recurrent bile duct stones can be successfully removed in up to 80% to 85% of patients with the use of percutaneous or endoscopic techniques. However, problems related to difficult biliary access, large stones, and biliary strictures may decrease the success rate of this approach. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in 16 patients with complicated biliary stones treated prospectively over a 24-month period. Successful stone fragmentation was achieved in 15 patients (94%) using a Dornier HM3 lithotripter (average of 2290 shocks at 22 kV). Three patients (19%) required a second ESWL treatment. Biliary clearance of stone fragments was spontaneous in seven (43%) of the patients and required additional treatment in eight (57%) of the patients. Complications from ESWL were minor and included transient hematuria and ecchymoses at the skin entry site. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy failed in one patient (6%) with a biliary stricture and surgery was required. At hospital discharge, all patients were asymptomatic and stone free. Treatment with ESWL appears to be a safe and effective adjunct for selected patients with complex biliary stone disease. \nThe orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: evaluation of autonomic function and treatment with octreotide and ergot alkaloids. Orthostatic tachycardia is a poorly understood syndrome in which patients develop dizziness, diaphoresis, or palpitations upon shifting from the supine to the upright posture. The present study was performed to determine whether autonomic neuropathy might be present in these patients, and whether the abnormal hemodynamic response to standing might be the result of failure of reflex vasoconstriction. We measured autonomic function in 9 patients with idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia and 2 patients with orthostatic tachycardia and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and compared them to 33 age-matched controls. Although most patients with orthostatic tachycardia had normal vasomotor reflexes and normal surface potential amplitudes, the latency of the autonomic response, a measure of sympathetic nerve conduction velocity, was prolonged in the soles (2.44 +/- 0.08 s in patients with idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia vs. 2.12 +/- 0.04 s in controls; P less than 0.005). In 6 of 9 patients, however, the latencies were within the normal range. Autonomic surface potentials were absent in 1 diabetic patient with orthostatic tachycardia; the latency of the response in the feet was greatly prolonged (2.95 s) in the second patient. We also assessed the response of orthostatic tachycardia patients to octreotide and dihydroergotamine, which are known to have a pressor effect in patients with recognized forms of autonomic neuropathy. These agents, in combination, suppressed orthostatic tachycardia (from 116 +/- 7 to 89 +/- 6 beats/min; P less than 0.001) in patients with this syndrome. In summary, our data indicate that evidence of autonomic dysfunction is present in only a minority of patients with orthostatic tachycardia. Nevertheless, administration of the vasoconstrictor drugs dihydroergotamine and octreotide can prevent the abnormal hemodynamic response to the upright posture shown by patients with this syndrome. \nCrohn disease in the pediatric patient: CT evaluation. Computed tomographic (CT) scans and medical records of 25 children (age range, 10-18 years) with pathologically proved Crohn disease were reviewed to better define the role of CT in the management of pediatric patients with Crohn disease. CT findings included small bowel thickening (range, 5-10 mm) (n = 20), colonic wall thickening (range, 6-15 mm) (n = 15), and small bowel dilation (n = 5). Mesenteric abnormalities such as adenopathy and focal fatty proliferation were seen in 11 to 18 patients, respectively. Extraluminal complications were easily identified with CT. Abscesses were noted in seven patients, inflammatory masses in four, and perirectal or perineal inflammation in 10. Fistulas were detected in four patients. The authors conclude that CT should be the initial imaging study performed in children with known Crohn disease and a changing pattern of clinical symptoms. \nEffect of bisoprolol on blood pressure and arterial hemodynamics in systemic hypertension. Blood pressure, heart rate, common carotid and brachial arterial hemodynamics using pulsed Doppler flowmetry and pulse wave velocity determinations were evaluated using a double-blind crossover design versus placebo in 14 patients with sustained essential hypertension treated by the selective beta 1 blocking agent bisoprolol. Blood pressure and heart rate significantly decreased after bisoprolol, whereas no significant change occurred in the diameter, the blood flow and in the vascular resistance of the carotid and brachial circulations. Pulse wave velocity significantly decreased in the brachioradial and the carotid femoral areas. The decrease in the latter was -1.6 +/- 0.8 m/s with bisoprolol and -0.06 +/- 0.80 m/s with placebo (p = 0.001). Brachial artery compliance significantly increased from 117 +/- 49 to 205 +/- 84 cm4 x dynes-1 x 10(9) (p = 0.001), indicating that the antihypertensive effect of beta 1 blockade is associated with an improvement in the viscoelastic properties of the brachial artery wall. \nJ. Maxwell Chamberlain Memorial Paper. Role of staging in prognosis and management of thymoma. Eighty-five patients operated on for thymoma from 1972 to 1989 were evaluated, 32 with myasthenia gravis and 53 without. Masaoka staging revealed stage I disease in 45 (53%), stage II in 23 (27%), stage III in 14 (16%), and stage IVa in 3 (4%). There was no operative mortality. Actuarial survival at 10 years was 63.7% for all patients: 78.3% for those in stage I, 74.7% for those in stage II, and 20.8% for those in stage III. There was no recurrence in patients in stage I. Mediastinal recurrence developed in 4 patients in stage II considered to have noninvasive disease by the surgeon. It is recommended that all patients be followed up for a minimum of 10 years and that all patients in stages II and III receive postoperative radiotherapy. The presence of myasthenia gravis is no longer considered as an adverse factor in survival. \nRhabdomyolysis following total hip arthroplasty. We report six cases of contralateral limb involvement during total hip arthroplasty including swelling of the gluteal muscle compartments, rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and sciatic nerve palsy. The risk factors for such complications include obesity, prolonged operative time, and positioning in the lateral decubitus position. The laboratory and clinical findings are consistent with a gluteal muscle crush-injury with consequent compartment syndrome. The patients should be treated conservatively as symptoms can be expected to resolve. \nUsefulness of the corticotropin-releasing hormone test during bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling for the diagnosis of Cushing's disease. Inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling for ACTH measurement (IPSS) is used for the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome and for the preoperative location of pituitary microadenomas. Intermittent ACTH secretion from pituitary adenomas may result in insignificant differences between petrosal and peripheral ACTH levels at the time of sampling. Thus, pituitary stimulation during IPSS may improve the procedure. The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of CRH injection in combination with IPSS. Twenty-two patients with Cushing's disease (CD; 5 macroadenomas, 16 microadenomas, and 1 corticotroph hyperplasia) and 5 patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome were studied. Bilateral IPSS was successfully carried out on 25 patients. Patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome had, before and after CRH injection, central to peripheral ACTH gradients below 1.7. Four patients with CD had basal gradients below 1.4. After CRH administration all patients with CD had gradients above 3.2. Despite correct location of central catheters, the predicted location of pituitary microadenomas was erroneous in 41% of the cases. It was not improved after CRH injection. In conclusion, the combination of CRH injection with IPSS was useful for the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, as it increased the discrimination of the procedure. On the contrary, it was useless for the preoperative location of pituitary microadenomas, which was poorly predicted by IPSS. \nEnhancement of ischaemic rabbit skin flap survival with the antioxidant and free-radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine. 1. The burst of damaging oxygen free-radicals at the time of reperfusion is one of the crucial factors affecting skin flap survival after an ischaemic interval. In these experiments the efficacy of the antioxidant and free-radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine in improving the survival of ischaemic rabbit epigastric skin flaps was tested. 2. At the time of reperfusion flaps were given: (1) balanced salt solution by intravenous whole-body administration, (2) N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) by intravenous whole-body administration, (3) balanced salt solution by intra-arterial infusion into the flap, (4) N-acetylcysteine (20 mg/kg) by intra-arterial infusion into the flap, or (5) N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) by intra-arterial infusion into the flap. Flap survival at 1 week, and tissue levels of parameters related to free-radical production, blood levels of thromboxane B2 and peripheral resistance during reperfusion were determined. 3. Compared with controls (groups 1 and 3) which had flap survival rates (expressed as percentage surface area surviving) of 27.1% and 31.6%, respectively. N-acetylcysteine treatment in group 2 (55.2%) and group 4 (51.9%) resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) improvements in flap survival. The survival rate in group 5 (37.7%) was not significantly better than that of the controls. 4. N-Acetylcysteine significantly reduced parameters related to free-radical production in the skin flap after 30 min of reperfusion, determined as tissue levels of malonyldialdehyde and protein oxidation products. There was also a significant decrease in peripheral resistance when low-dose N-acetylcysteine (group 4) was infused intra-arterially into the flap. \nComparison of neuroendocrine activation in patients with left ventricular dysfunction with and without congestive heart failure. A substudy of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD). Neuroendocrine activation is known to occur in patients with congestive heart failure, but there is uncertainty as to whether this occurs before or after the presence of overt symptoms. In the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a multicenter study of patients with ejection fractions of 35% or less, we compared baseline plasma norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, plasma atrial natriuretic factor, and plasma arginine vasopressin in 56 control subjects, 151 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (no overt heart failure), and 81 patients with overt heart failure before randomization. Median values for plasma norepinephrine (p = 0.0001), plasma atrial natriuretic factor (p less than 0.0001), plasma arginine vasopressin (p = 0.006), and plasma renin activity (p = 0.03) were significantly higher in patients with left ventricular dysfunction than in normal control subjects. Neuroendocrine values were highest in patients with overt heart failure. Plasma renin activity was normal in patients with left ventricular dysfunction without heart failure who were not receiving diuretics and was significantly increased (p less than 0.05) in patients on diuretic therapy. We conclude that neuroendocrine activation occurs in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and no heart failure. Neuroendocrine activation is further increased as overt heart failure ensues and diuretics are added to therapy. \nUse of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in the treatment of Crohn's disease. The efficacy and safety of therapy with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine was studied in 78 patients with Crohn's disease. Mean duration of therapy was 1.6 years; 52 patients were treated greater than or equal to 6 months. All patients were also on other antiinflammatory medications. Evaluations included self-assessment and physician's assessment of well-being, functional capacity, general clinical response, clinical activities indices (National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis/International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Harvey-Bradshaw), and achievement of specific therapeutic goals. General clinical condition improved in 70% of the patients. Median response time was 3 months. The average Harvey-Bradshaw score decreased 37% with therapy, and a decrease of greater than or equal to 30% occurred in 66% of the subjects. An overall 72% achievement rate for specified therapeutic goals included controlling refractory disease, 73%; corticosteroid \"sparing,\" 76%; and lessening fistulization, 63%. Nine patients got worse despite therapy. Adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy occurred in 10%, whereas dosages were briefly lowered for mild side effects in another 10%. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine in the majority of selected patients with chronic, unremitting, or steroid-requiring Crohn's disease. \nClinical, biochemical, and morphological correlates in patients bearing growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumors with or without constitutively active adenylyl cyclase. Somatic mutations in the alpha-chain (alpha s) of the stimulatory regulatory protein of adenylyl cyclase (Gs) causing constitutive activation of the enzyme have been identified in a subset of human GH-secreting pituitary adenomas. This study reports on the differences between acromegalic patients bearing tumors without (group 1; n = 51) or with (group 2; n = 29) this alteration. No difference in age, sex, clinical features, duration of the disease, or cure rate was observed between the two groups. By contrast, group 2 patients had higher basal GH levels than group 1. Moreover, a significant difference in sellar morphology was found; group 2 patients more frequently showed sellas of normal size (grade I) than group 1. Hypersecretory activity of group 2 tumors was also apparent at electron microscopy; contrary to those of group 1, cells of group 2 tumors were densely granulated and showed prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. With respect to group 1, group 2 patients were less responsive to GH-releasing hormone, while they were more sensitive to somatostatin- and dopamine-induced GH inhibition. These results suggest that patients with constitutively active adenylyl cyclase have hyperactive tumors; the sensitivity of these tumors to inhibitory agents (somatostatin and dopamine), possibly counteracting the expression of activating mutations, might explain the low rate of tumor growth. \nHearing improvement after acoustic tumor removal. Hearing improvement after removal of an acoustic tumor is an uncommon occurrence. Hearing improvement was observed in 8.5% of acoustic tumor removals performed using the middle fossa approach in an attempt to preserve hearing. Improvement in speech discrimination occurred most frequently and was of greatest magnitude compared with changes in the speech reception threshold or pure-tone average. No preoperative factors were predictive of postoperative hearing improvement. Findings support the conclusion that candidates for hearing preservation surgery should be chosen on the merits of their existing preoperative hearing and not on the basis of anticipated improvement. \nDiabetes Intervention Study. Multi-intervention trial in newly diagnosed NIDDM. OBJECTIVE: In a randomized 5-yr multi-intervention trial, we tested the efficacy of intensified health education (IHE) in improving metabolic control and reducing the level of coronary risk factors and incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Within the intervention group, the benefit of clofibric acid was evaluated in a double-blind study. One thousand one hundred thirty-nine newly diagnosed middle-aged (30- to 55-yr-old) patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) entered the study. They were classified as diet controlled after a 6-wk screening phase with conventional dietary treatment. During the follow-up, the control group (n = 378) was cared for at different diabetes outpatient clinics with a standardized surveillance. The intervention group (n = 761) had a structured IHE that included dietary advice, antismoking and antialcohol education, and ways to enhance physical activity. RESULTS: Randomly, 379 of the IHE patients received 1.6 g clofibric acid/day, and the others received placebo. IHE resulted in improved glucose control (adjusted fasting blood glucose) levels after 5 yr (control subjects 9.27 mM, IHE group 8.71 mM, and IHE plus clofibric acid group 8.60 mM, P less than 0.01). The better glycemic control was achieved with fewer antidiabetic drugs. After 5 yr, antidiabetic drugs were prescribed to 47% of the control subjects, 28% of the IHE group, and 34% of the IHE plus clofibric acid group (cutoff limit for drug application was postprandial blood glucose of greater than or equal to 13.87 mM). The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (0.26 vs. 0.40, P less than 0.01) and physical activity (174 vs. 327 scores, P less than 0.01) were increased, and blood pressure, tobacco, and alcohol consumption were significantly reduced by IHE. However, IHE had no effect on calorie intake, percentage of fat in the diet (45%), and body weight. The most important finding was the significant increase of blood cholesterol in all three groups (+0.47, +0.36, and +0.34 mM, respectively). Clofibric acid only prevented the increase of triglyceride levels (+0.56, +0.24, and +0.05 mM, respectively). The incidence rate per 1000 for myocardial infarction was 30.3 for control subjects, 53.6 for the IHE group, and 55.6 for the IHE plus clofibric acid group. The corresponding rates for IHD incidence were 90.9, 97.8, and 98.8, respectively. Men suffered more frequently from myocardial infarction, whereas women developed ECG criteria for IHD more frequently. Among the 35 cases of death, besides cardiovascular diseases, liver cirrhosis and neoplasia were the predominant causes. The death rate per 1000 in control subjects was 46.2, 30.6 in the IHE group, and 27 among patients with IHE plus clofibric acid. CONCLUSIONS: IHE was of substantial benefit for the control of glycemia, significantly diminished the need for antidiabetic drugs, and reduced a cluster of risk factors but had no effect on the control of blood lipids. This could be one major reason for the failure of IHE, effective lowering of blood pressure, and clofibric acid to prevent cardiovascular complications. Clofibric acid was only effective in reducing triglycerides. \nEpidemiology of colonic symptoms and the irritable bowel syndrome. Functional gastrointestinal disease is believed to be very common, but reports of its prevalence have not usually evaluated random community samples, and validated questionnaires have not been used to elicit symptoms. The prevalence of specific colonic symptoms and the irritable bowel syndrome among representative middle-aged whites was determined from a defined population, and the impact of these symptoms on presentation for medical care was measured. An age- and sex-stratified random sample of 1021 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, aged 30-64 years, was obtained. All subjects were mailed a valid self-report questionnaire that identified gastrointestinal symptoms and functional gastrointestinal disorders. The response rate was 82% (n = 835). The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of abdominal pain (more than six times in the prior year) was 26.2 per 100 (95% confidence interval, 23.1-29.2). The prevalence of chronic constipation (hard stools and straining and/or less than 3 stools per week greater than 25% of the time) was 17.4 (95% confidence interval, 14.8-20.0), whereas the prevalence of chronic diarrhea (loose watery stools, and/or greater than 3 stools per day greater than 25% of the time) was 17.9 (95% confidence interval, 15.3-20.5). The prevalence of abdominal pain and disturbed defecation was similar in women and men, except that infrequent defecation and straining at stool were more common in women. Using the Manning symptom criteria to identify irritable bowel syndrome (greater than or equal to 2 of 6 symptoms in those with abdominal pain more than six times in the prior year), the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome was 17.0 per 100 (95% confidence interval, 14.4-19.6). Overall, 71 persons (9%) reported visiting a physician for abdominal pain or disturbed defecation in the prior year; a subset of variables related to pain severity were the best predictors of health care seeking after adjustment for age and gender. However, these accounted for only 22% of the log likelihood. In conclusion, more than one third of an unselected middle-aged population reported chronic abdominal pain or disturbed defecation, and more than one in six had symptoms compatible with the irritable bowel syndrome. Only a minority had presented for medical evaluation; moreover, the characteristics of the abdominal complaints did not explain the seeking of health care in most cases. \nThe development of penicillin-resistant oral streptococci after repeated penicillin prophylaxis. Oral streptococci may cause infective endocarditis in patients with susceptible cardiac disease after dental treatment. Multiple dental visits, each preceded by penicillin prophylaxis, may result in the unwanted development of resistant oral streptococci. This study was undertaken to determine whether resistant oral streptococci would develop after the repeated use of penicillin prophylaxis in healthy adults. Plaque samples were collected from 20 subjects on each Monday for 5 successive weeks. Each subject was administered 2 gm penicillin V followed by 1 gm 6 hours later (standard prophylaxis regimen of the American Heart Association), on three successive Mondays (weeks 2, 3, and 4). The total cultivable oral streptococci and penicillin-resistant oral streptococci were determined for each plaque sample, and representative colonies of resistant streptococci were speciated. During the study, there was a significant increase in the number of subjects who harbored penicillin-resistant oral streptococci. However, with the exception of one subject who had resistant streptococci throughout the study, the number of resistant strains represented only 0.0003% to 0.41% of the total cultivable oral streptococci. \nSnoring and the risk of ischemic brain infarction. To determine if a history of snoring is a risk factor for brain infarction, I conducted a case-control study of risk factors for ischemic stroke using 177 consecutive male patients aged 16-60 (mean 49) years with acute brain infarction. For each patient I chose an age-matched (+/- 6 years) male control. Arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, snoring (habitually or often), and heavy drinking (greater than 300 g/wk) were risk factors in the stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio of snoring for brain infarction was 2.13. By McNemar's test this association increased strongly if a history of sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obesity were all present with snoring (odds ratio 8.00). My study indicates that snoring may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, possibly because of the higher prevalence of an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome among snorers than nonsnorers. \nKinetic modeling of in vivo--nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data: 5-fluorouracil in liver and liver tumors. Kinetic modeling has been applied to the time course of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal intensities of 5-fluorouracil and the sum of its catabolites, alpha-fluoro-beta-ureido propanoic acid and alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine, as monitored in liver tumors of seven patients with cancer after brief intraarterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. Because these data represent only relative tissue concentrations, only ratios of clearance and volume parameters can be estimated (e.g., clearance/central volume of distribution or central volume of distribution/steady-state volume of distribution). On the other hand, parameters that do not refer to volumes, such as half-lives or maximal velocity of metabolic conversion of a nonlinear model, can be estimated in absolute terms. A nonlinear three-compartment model gave satisfactory fits with all of the individual data sets. Kinetics of 5-fluorouracil and catabolites were similar in five patients with metastases of colorectal adenocarcinomas but differed from those of two patients with cholangiocarcinoma and metastases of an anaplastic carcinoma of unknown origin, respectively. \nPercutaneous cooling of ischemic myocardium by hypothermic retroperfusion of autologous arterial blood: effects on regional myocardial temperature distribution and infarct size. The effects of synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion of cooled autologous arterial blood on regional myocardial temperature distribution and infarct size were studied in open chest dogs with 3.5 h of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. After 30 min of occlusion, the dogs were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) untreated control group (n = 5), 2) normothermic retroperfusion group (infusion temperature 32 degrees C) (n = 7), and 3) hypothermic retroperfusion group (infusion temperature 15 degrees C) (n = 7). Regional myocardial temperatures were measured by using needle-tipped thermistors stabbed in the 1) anterior wall distal to the occlusion site, 2) anterior wall proximal to the occlusion site, 3) left lateral wall, 4) posterior wall, and 5) right ventricular free wall. Rectal and pulmonary artery temperatures were also measured. In the hypothermic retroperfusion group, the anterior wall temperature decreased rapidly by 5 degrees C at 15 min of retroperfusion (p less than 0.05 vs. normothermic retroperfusion or untreated control groups), whereas the temperature at other sites decreased with a linear trend over time. Myocardial temperatures in the ischemic area (distal anterior wall) were generally lower than those in the other sites during the first 60 min of hypothermic retroperfusion and the largest intramyocardial temperature difference (3.6 degrees C) was found at 15 min after retroperfusion. Infarct size expressed as a percent of the risk area was significantly smaller in the hypothermic retroperfusion group (6.2 +/- 3.3%) than in the control (64.9 +/- 14%) or normothermic retroperfusion groups (24.1 +/- 6.7%). \nComprehensive evaluation and treatment of 75 men referred to chronic prostatitis clinic. We investigated the role of genitourinary tract infections, structural and psychologic abnormalities in 75 men referred to a \"chronic prostatitis\" clinic. Patients had had symptoms for an average of eighty-three months and had received an average of ten weeks of antimicrobial treatment during the three months prior to evaluation. Specific infectious diseases, structural or functional causes were identified in 34 (45%) of the 75 patients. Genitourinary tract pathogens were isolated from 26 patients and inflammation was documented in urethral or prostatic secretions of 24 patients. Structural or functional abnormalities that merited treatment were identified in 8 cases. In addition, major criteria for depression were documented in 9 of 17 patients who agreed to this evaluation. Overall, a comprehensive approach to diagnosis led to specific treatment for 37 (49%) of the 75 men with chronic prostatitis, despite longstanding symptoms and failure of multiple prior courses of therapy. \nA new anticancer drug delivery system for the management of carcinomatous peritonitis. To develop a new drug delivery system for the treatment of carcinomatous peritonitis, we constructed 5-fluorouracil poly L-microcapsules (5Fu-mc) by the organic phase separation technique and examined their drug-releasing capacities and anticancer effects. The microcapsules consisted of in vitro dissolvable polymolecular poly L-lactic acid and 5-fluorouracil (5Fu). The 5Fu-mc was about 200 microns in diameter and had a 5Fu content of about 40% (weight/weight). 5Fu-release time from the microcapsules was about 50 hours in vitro and about 48 hours in vivo. After the release of the 5Fu, the poly L-lactic acid was metabolized very slowly in the peritoneal cavity. The 5Fu-mc caused fewer side effects than the equivalent dose of a 5Fu solution. In addition, macroscopic and microscopic examinations of various abdominal organs revealed no toxic effects from the microcapsules. After administration of 5Fu-mc into the abdominal cavity of rats with AH-130 carcinomatous peritonitis, the 5Fu concentration remained at a high level for an extended period in the ascites but fell rapidly to low levels in the plasma. In conclusion, the present studies indicated that the 5Fu-mc were much more effective in prolonging the life of tumor-bearing hosts while producing less systemic side effects than a 5Fu solution. \nAcyclovir therapy in neonates. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of acyclovir disposition in neonates with renal dysfunction. DESIGN: Prospective sequential open enrollment of neonates with presumed herpes group virus infections. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units in the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. PATIENTS: Sixteen neonates with gestational ages between 27 and 40 weeks (median 38 weeks) were given acyclovir between days 1 and 56 of life to treat presumed herpes virus infections. Six infants were critically ill with multisystem disease, five infants had hepatic failure and underwent blood exchange transfusion, and five infants had renal failure. A mean of four (range 1 to 19) serum acyclovir concentrations per patient were measured by radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from acyclovir concentrations in 46 samples from 16 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic disposition of acyclovir was described as a two-compartment model. Although the ranges for acyclovir clearance and terminal elimination (t 1/2 beta) were wide, a statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between clearance and beta versus serum creatinine concentration. The average t 1/2 beta for infants with serum creatinine level less than 1 mg/dl (88 mumol/L) was 5.0 hours, and 15.6 hours for those with serum creatinine level greater than 1 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: Neonates with hepatic or renal dysfunction or young premature infants accumulate acyclovir when dosed without adjustment for organ dysfunction. Measurement of serum creatinine or creatinine clearance can be useful in the dosing of acyclovir in neonates. \nBlood loss after total knee replacement. Effects of tourniquet release and continuous passive motion. We prospectively studied the cases of 121 patients who were being operated on for insertion of a unilateral total knee prosthesis with cement, and we placed them randomly in four groups. In Group I, the tourniquet was inflated throughout the operative procedure, and we released it postoperatively after a compressive dressing had been applied; a splint was used postoperatively for three days. In Group II, the tourniquet remained inflated throughout the operation, but no splint was applied postoperatively, and continuous passive motion was started immediately in the recovery room. In Group III, the tourniquet was released intraoperatively, and hemostasis was achieved by cauterization; postoperatively, a compressive dressing was applied, and a splint was used for three days. In Group IV, the tourniquet was released intraoperatively, hemostasis was established, and then the tourniquet was reinflated; a compressive dressing was applied, and continuous passive motion was started immediately in the recovery room. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values were monitored in all patients. Blood loss in suction drainage was recorded, and the total blood loss was calculated. The results show that total knee arthroplasty is associated with major loss of blood (mean, 1518 milliliters). The calculated blood loss for Groups I, II, and III averaged 1443 milliliters, while that for Group IV averaged 1793 milliliters. Loss in suction drainage correlated with total estimated blood loss and averaged 511 milliliters. The magnitude of blood loss after total knee arthroplasty should be appreciated, and special attention should be paid to the availability of adequate fluid and blood products, preferably blood donated by the patient preoperatively. \nPregnancy outcome in patients with high titer anti-RNP antibodies. A retrospective study of 40 pregnancies. In a retrospective study the outcome of 40 pregnancies in 20 women with a high titer of anti-RNP antibodies was evaluated. In the 18 pregnancies that occurred after disease onset, transient proteinuria was noted in 3 and transient thrombocytopenia in 2. Deep venous thrombosis was observed in one patient. Preeclampsia in another woman necessitated cesarean sections in 2 pregnancies with successful outcome. The observed complications may all be seen in normal pregnancies. There was no evidence of exacerbation of maternal disease during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. Our study indicates that in women with high anti-RNP titer the risk of fetal loss or maternal worsening of disease seems slight. \nEffusion cytology. Cytologic evaluation is the best way to detect the presence of malignancy in body cavity fluids. Although a positive diagnosis is highly reliable, a negative result does not rule out a malignant cause. Adenocarcinomas, well-differentiated squamous carcinomas, small-cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, large-cell lymphomas, and acute leukemias are accurately classified when present in effusions. The definitive diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, small-cell lymphomas, and chronic leukemias, and subclassification of sarcomas and poorly differentiated neoplasms are difficult and may require additional diagnostic techniques. With a few exceptions, the exact causes of benign effusions cannot be determined by cytologic methods. \nSafety of simultaneous aortic reconstruction and renal transplantation. Patients with aortic disease and end-stage renal failure who require both aortic reconstruction and renal transplantation (simultaneously or staged) pose a formidable clinical challenge. Traditionally, the performance of either one of these procedures has been viewed as a relative contraindication to the performance of the other. From 1978 to 1989, eight patients were referred to us with the combination of aortic disease and end-stage renal failure. Seven had aneurysmal disease and one had aorto-iliac occlusive disease. Five patients presented with their diseases sequentially and had two sequential operations, with a mean interval of 4 years between procedures. Three patients presented with their diseases simultaneously and underwent simultaneous aortic reconstruction and living related renal transplantation. All patients were followed up for a mean interval of 4.5 years. By life-table analysis, the 5-year renal graft survival was 100%, the primary aortic graft patency was 82%, and the secondary aortic graft patency was 100%. The only death in this series occurred 11 years after aortic reconstruction and 4 months after a renal transplantation and was due to overwhelming cytomegalovirus sepsis. There were no significant differences between the simultaneous and staged groups in terms of operative mortality, postoperative complications, transplant function, or aortic graft patency. From this experience, we conclude that: (1) patients who present simultaneously with aortic disease and end-stage renal failure can safely undergo simultaneous aortic reconstruction and renal transplantation; (2) patients who present with these two diseases sequentially can undergo a second reconstructive procedure with very low operative morbidity and mortality rates; (3) when these two procedures have been performed sequentially, the second procedure has not significantly altered the 30-day or 5-year results of the first procedure; and (4) the 30-day and 5-year results of each procedure have been excellent regardless of the temporal sequence in which they were performed. \nBiomagnetic localization of ventricular arrhythmias. The magnetic fields caused by electrical activity of the human heart can be coherently measured with a highly sensitive, multichannel, superconducting quantum interference-device system and can enable noninvasive localization of the underlying electrical activity. The magnetocardiograms (MCGs) of 10 patients with spontaneous premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), three patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), and four healthy subjects with induced paced beats were recorded for 2-15 minutes. After correction for superimposed repolarization activity, the site of origin of the arrhythmias was localized from the magnetic field distribution at the onset of the ectopic beats. The localization results of paced beats showed an error of a few millimeters in relation to the position of the catheter tip. The results of spontaneous PVC and VT were confirmed with endocardial mapping or associated with ischemic lesions. The authors conclude that multichannel magnetocardiographic studies enable the completely noninvasive localization of ventricular arrhythmias. \nPrimary tumors of the facial (extracranial) nerve. Nearly 25% of all primary neurogenous tumors arise from peripheral nerves in the head and neck. The extracranial parts of the facial nerve, however, rank low as potential sites. Their tumors nonetheless pose diagnostic and management problems. In the intraparotid location the neurogenous tumors most often present as mass lesions, accompanied, in one third of patients, by various degrees of facial weakness. With the exception of a peculiar predilection of childhood plexiform neurofibromas to afflict the facial nerve, the majority of the tumors are neurilemomas. Recurrences are unusual after surgical removal of either neurilemomas or neurofibromas. The rare facial nerve sarcoma is a high-grade malignancy. \nGiant axonal neuropathy and leukodystrophy. An 11-year-old Persian boy, born to consanguineous parents, manifested a progressive gait abnormality beginning at 5 years of age. A severe cerebellar disorder developed with associated dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system, but no sign of mental impairment. The sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities were greatly reduced, especially in the lower extremities. Cerebrospinal fluid protein was normal. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed leukoencephalopathy, especially in the cerebellum, but also in periventricular areas. The diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy was established by biopsy of the sural nerve. The few previous histologic examinations have documented hyperplasia of the microfibrils which accumulate in the axons as well as in neurilemma, endothelial, and perineural cells. This is the first report of involvement of supraspinal portions of the central nervous system documented by postmortem examination after in vivo imaging methods corroborated the morphologic concomitants of the clinical symptoms. \nEfficacy of intraarterial heparin in maintaining microvascular patency: an experimental model. Human-grade sodium heparin was studied to determine thrombosis model patency rates between an intraarterial infusion versus an intravenous method of delivery in a rabbit model. Specific differences in patency and partial thromboplastin times were studied in each group and compared with a saline-perfused group. Three animal groups (New Zealand white rabbits) were established (total = 35 animals). Standardized femoral arterial 5-mm inversion grafts (AIG) were done in each animal in each group. The animals in the control group received intravenous saline infusion, while the two treatment groups received intravenous heparin (12 animals) or intraarterial heparin (12 animals minus 1 anesthesia death). The route of instillation of the infusate was selected at random after completing the inversion grafts. A proximal epigastric branch was utilized for access in those animals randomized to the intraarterial group. Intravenous delivery was accomplished by means of a femoral venous catheter in the vena cava. A 72-hour period of infusion was used in all animals. A dose of 45 units per hour of heparin following a 500-unit bolus was used in the intravenous group. After an identical bolus dose, 25 units per hour of heparin was administered in the intraarterial group. The control (saline group) was given 1 cc saline (in a volume equal to the heparin-dosed groups) daily for 3 days. Arterial inversion graft patency rates were assessed by direct inspection at day 5. Systemic and regional (i.e., distal to the inversion graft) partial thromboplastin times (PTT) were measured in representative control, IV, and intraarterial heparin-treated groups. Complications were recorded. \nAttaching and effacing enteropathogenic Escherichia coli as a cause of infantile diarrhea in Bangkok. To identify Escherichia coli that cause infantile diarrhea in Bangkok, Thailand, E. coli isolated in a year-long study of infantile diarrhea were examined for O and H serotypes and virulence determinants. Classic enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) were isolated from 28 of 509 infants with diarrhea (cases) and 11 of 509 age-matched controls (P = .009; odds ratio [OR], 2.64). Most of this difference was attributable to EPEC adherence factor (EAF)-positive EPEC that produced an attachment and effacement lesion, as identified in the fluorescence actin staining assay, isolated from 13 cases and 1 control (P = .003; OR, 13.3). EAF-EPEC was isolated from 15 cases and 10 controls (P = .418; OR, 1.52) and EAF+ non-EPEC from 17 cases and 10 controls (P = .242; OR, 1.72). EAF+EPEC that caused an attachment and effacement lesion was found in 3% of children less than 6 months old with diarrhea who were studied in an outpatient clinic in Bangkok in 1988. \nInflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen. Report of two cases with a review of the literature. This study reports two cases of inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen. The first case was a 57-year-old woman in whom the splenic mass was an incidental finding during evaluation for an acute abdomen due to a perforated, lithiasic gallbladder. The mass in the spleen measured 12.7 cm in greatest dimension. The second case was of a 46-year-old woman with a palpable, left upper quadrant mass. A computed tomography scan revealed a splenic mass and the spleen was removed. The mass measured 12 cm in greatest dimension. In a review of the literature, 13 examples of splenic inflammatory pseudotumor were reported. The age range was 19 to 75 years, with a median age of 50 years. The splenic lesions were either discovered incidentally or manifested by left upper quadrant discomfort and/or mass. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen, although rare, is being increasingly recognized and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the spleen. \nSixteenth Daniel C. Baker, Jr, memorial lecture. Surgical management of supraglottic cancer and its lymph node metastases in a conservative perspective. Supraglottic laryngectomy combined with functional elective or curative neck dissection is a priceless contribution toward treatment of supraglottic cancer and its lymph node metastases. The history and background of this conservative approach is reviewed. Results related to staging are presented. Irradiation as a combined or alternative therapy is considered. \nRole of hepatitis delta virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA integrates into the host DNA and shows a series of potentially oncogenetic properties, but HBV is not an acutely transforming virus, because HCC develops decades after infection. Other factors, namely cirrhosis, inflammation, alcohol intake, and viral superinfections, could promote the oncogenetic process induced by HBV-DNA integration. We studied the impact of HDV infection in the pathogenesis of HCC in 62 consecutive patients. Their mean age was 59 years (range 25-75 years), 54 were male and eight female; 58 had cirrhosis. The findings suggest that HBsAg-positive patients with HDV superinfection developed cirrhosis and HCC at an earlier age than HBsAg carriers without HDV infection. HDV appears to represent a \"promotion\" factor for HCC in subjects with an oncogenic risk induced by HBV. A long-lasting necroinflammatory lesion of the liver substained by productive HBV and HDV infections may be a major pathogenetic mechanism. \nChronic dermal ulcer healing enhanced with monophasic pulsed electrical stimulation. The purposes of this randomized, double-blind, multicenter study were to compare healing of chronic dermal ulcers treated with pulsed electrical stimulation with healing of similar wounds treated with sham electrical stimulation and to evaluate patient tolerance to the therapeutic protocol. Forty-seven patients, aged 29 to 91 years, with 50 stage II, III, and IV ulcers were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (n = 26) or a control (sham treatment) group (n = 24). Treated wounds received 30 minutes of pulsed cathodal electrical stimulation twice daily at a pulse frequency of 128 pulses per second (pps) and a peak amplitude of 29.2 mA if the wound contained necrotic tissue or any drainage that was not serosanguinous. A saline-moistened nontreatment electrode was applied 30.5 cm (12 in) cephalad from the wound. This protocol was continued for 3 days after the wound was debrided or exhibited serosanguinous drainage. Thereafter, the polarity of the treatment electrode on the wound was changed every 3 days until the wound progressed to a stage II classification. The pulse frequency was then reduced to 64 pps, and the treatment electrode polarity was changed daily until the wound was healed. Patients in the control group were treated with the same protocol, except they received sham electrical stimulation. After 4 weeks, wounds in the treatment and control groups were 44% and 67% of their initial size, respectively. The healing rates per week for the treatment and control groups were 14% and 8.25%, respectively. The results of this study indicate that pulsed electrical stimulation has a beneficial effect on healing stage II, III, and IV chronic dermal ulcers. \nLevamisole for corticosteroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome in childhood. British Association for Paediatric Nephrology. In children with corticosteroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome who are dependent on high-dose prednisolone, alkylating therapy often fails to maintain a remission, and long-term immunosuppression may be hazardous. An alternative approach to treatment is to use an immunostimulant such as levamisole. 61 children with frequently relapsing corticosteroid sensitive and dependent nephrotic syndrome were randomly allocated to receive levamisole, 2.5 mg/kg on alternate days (31 patients) or placebo (30 patients) for a maximum of 112 days. After entry to the trial, prednisolone was progressively reduced and was stopped by 56 days. The two groups were well matched for age and sex distribution, indices of corticosteroid toxicity, and previous alkylating therapy. 14 patients in the levamisole group and 4 in the placebo group remained in remission at 112 days (log rank analysis p less than 0.01). No significant adverse events were recorded. Levamisole is effective in maintaining a steroid-free remission in this condition and has few side-effects. \nLack of efficacy of high-dose leucovorin and fluorouracil in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Leucovorin potentiates the cytotoxicity of fluorouracil (5-FU) in experimental tumor systems and appears to enhance the effectiveness of 5-FU in patients with colon cancer. Twenty-two eligible patients (18 previously untreated) with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated in a phase II trial of leucovorin 500 mg/m2/d for 6 days by continuous intravenous infusion with 5-FU 370 mg/m2/d by rapid intravenous injection on 5 consecutive days, beginning 24 hours after initiation of leucovorin infusion. Among the 20 assessable patients, there were no complete or partial regressions, although there was one minor response lasting 4 months. Three patients had stable disease for 5, 20, and 21 months, respectively. Median survival was 10 weeks. Toxicity was predominantly mucosal; stomatitis grade 2 or worse was seen in five patients, and diarrhea grade 2 or worse was seen in four. Hospitalization for toxicity was necessary in four previously untreated patients and three previously treated patients. The median WBC nadir was 4.6 (range, 1.4 to 9.6) x 10(3)/microL, and the median platelet nadir was 147.0 (range, 69.0 to 240.0) x 10(3)/microL. This combination of leucovorin and 5-FU did not demonstrate meaningful therapeutic activity in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and was associated with moderate to severe toxicity. It should not be considered a standard treatment for patients with this disease. \nPercutaneous placement of Hickman catheters: comparison of sonographically guided and blind techniques. We studied the value of sonographically guided puncture of the subclavian vein for placement of indwelling right atrial and permanent subcutaneously tunneled catheters (Hickman) for long-term venous access. The commonly used blind puncture is associated with complications such as pneumothorax, arterial puncture, and hemothorax. The results and complications of 40 sonographically guided punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations of the subclavian vein (group 1, 31 patients) performed in the radiology department were compared with those of 40 blind percutaneous punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations (group 2, 29 patients) performed in the operating room. The patients were selected consecutively. The groups were comparable in age, sex, and indication for catheter placement; administration of chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies was the major indication (group 1, 84%; group 2, 83%). All punctures in group 1 were successful; group 2 had two failures (5%). Puncture-related complications occurred significantly more in group 2 (10%) than in group 1 (0%) (p less than .05). These complications were pneumothorax in three cases and hemothorax in one. Complications not related to the puncture technique were prolonged bleeding at the entrance site (groups 1 and 2, two cases each), local infection (group 1, one case), thrombosis (group 1, three cases; group 2, two), catheter sepsis (group 1, 10 cases; group 2, 14), catheter occlusion (group 2, three cases), and catheter migration (groups 1 and 2, two cases each). We conclude that sonographically guided puncture increases the success rate and significantly decreases the puncture-related complications of percutaneous placement of Hickman catheters. \nOperative laparoscopy with the Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of endometriosis and pelvic adhesions. A multicenter, prospective trial was initiated to test the effectiveness and safety of the Nd:YAG laser equipped with artificial sapphire contact tips for the laparoscopic treatment of pelvic pain. Ninety-three women were enrolled in the study, 37 with endometriosis alone, 47 with endometriosis complicated by pelvic adhesions, and 9 women with adhesions alone. In over 90% of adhesions and 96% of endometriotic implants the Nd:YAG laser could be delivered to the site and be used to restore normal anatomy. The exception was deep bowel involvement with endometriosis, which was not treated. The majority of women had marked reduction or resolution of their symptoms for up to 12 months postoperatively. We conclude that the use of the Nd:YAG laser is an appropriate method to laparoscopically treat pelvic pain resulting from endometriosis or pelvic adhesions. \nAdult lipophagic atrophic panniculitis. We report two patients with chronic, recurrent, nodular panniculitis lesions that later developed areas of lipoatrophy. Histologically, there was a consistent lobular lipophagic replacement of fat cells with lipophagic giant cells. The clinical appearance was that of tender, erythematous, superficial or subcutaneous, symmetrical nodules and plaques of 1-2 weeks' duration. The lesions could occur with episodes of fever. One patient had hepatomegaly and the other had an increased sedimentation rate and leucocytosis. The histology and the clinical pattern of the panniculitus syndrome resembled those of lipophagic lipoatrophy of childhood. This is a panniculitis of unknown cause in which the principal inflammatory cell response in the subcutaneous tissue is the macrophage. \nFlow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Using two colour immunofluorescence with fluorescein isothiocyanate and phycoerythrin labelled monoclonal antibodies, multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to examine the antigenic characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocytes in whole blood of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease who were not taking immunosuppressive drugs. The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease remained unchanged so that the CD4/CD8 ratio was the same as that of normal control subjects. In Crohn's disease there were many activated T cells (CD3+, CD25+). Although natural killer cells in active Crohn's disease were lower than in normal control subjects, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as defined by CD3+, CD16+, did not differ in patients with inflammatory bowel disease compared with normal control subjects. For B cell subsets, there were differences in Leu-1+ B cells, Leu-8+ B cells, Fc epsilon R+B cells (Leu-16+, Leu-20+), and activated B cells (Leu-12+, Leu-21+) between patients with inflammatory bowel disease and normal control subjects. These differences are compatible with local activation of B cells in the inflamed colon. \nCarcinoma of the rectum: a 10-year experience. A consecutive series of 303 patients with carcinoma of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon treated by a single surgeon over a 10-year period are reported. Of these, 202 underwent an anterior resection, 85 an abdominoperineal excision of the rectum and 16 a coloanal anastomosis. Surgery was considered palliative in 52 patients undergoing anterior resection and 24 undergoing abdominoperineal resection. The 30-day hospital mortality rate was six patients (3 per cent) for anterior resection and two patients (2 per cent) for abdominoperineal resection. Peroperative anastomotic testing demonstrated leakage in five stapled anastomoses; these were rectified and no clinical sequelae occurred. Two patients (1 per cent) developed a clinical anastomotic leak, one of which proved fatal; in each case the intraoperative test was negative. The overall 5-year survival rate was 64 per cent after anterior resection and 52 per cent after abdominoperineal resection; the median follow-up was 64 months. The incidence of local pelvic recurrence was 6.4 per cent after anterior resection and 14 per cent after abdominoperineal (not significant). These results confirm the success of sphincter-saving anterior resection combined with total mesorectal excision, routine full mobilization of the splenic flexure and cancercidal lavage of the distal rectum in the treatment of low rectal carcinomas; morbidity, local recurrence and survival are not compromised. \nInternal mammary artery to lung parenchyma fistula after aortocoronary bypass grafting. Two unusual cases of internal mammary artery fistulization to lung parenchyma after coronary revascularization are reported. They were incidentally discovered during coronary angiography, and one of them was successfully closed with a percutaneous transvenous coil-spring occluder. The cause is thought to be the direct contact between the dissected mammary artery pedicle and the lung parenchyma. \nDiffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis: a new constellation of findings. Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis is a rare, frequently fatal disease characterized by multiple cutaneous and visceral hemangiomas. The skin, liver, lungs, intestines, and central nervous system are the most commonly affected organs. Death can result from high-output cardiac failure as a result of arteriovenous shunting. In this report we present a new constellation of findings in a patient with diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis, namely, an absent corpus callosum, ectopia cordis (sternal agenesis) with median abdominal raphe, and tricuspid atresia. \nLaparotomy closure reinforced with buried polyglyconate retention sutures. A method of laparotomy closure using continuous no. 0 polyglycolic acid suture for accurate fascial approximation and buried retention sutures of no. 1 polyglyconate for prolonged wound strength is described. Both security and anatomical precision in fascial closure are achieved without the use of nonabsorbable suture material. This method of laparotomy closure is suitable for patients at high risk for fascial dehiscence. \nAdjuvant radiation therapy in patients with detectable prostate specific antigen following radical prostatectomy. Adjuvant radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate was given to 25 patients. Of these patients 8 had microscopic lymph node metastasis, 8 had seminal vesicle invasion without positive lymph nodes, 6 had positive surgical margins and 3 had only capsule penetration. Their only evidence of residual disease was detectable serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) by the Yang assay. A total of 15 patients (60%) had a subsequent decrease in PSA to less than 0.3 ng./ml. and an additional 5 (20%) had a decrease in PSA by more than 50%. Currently 8 patients have no detectable PSA after a median followup of 18 months (17 to 38 months) since initiating radiation therapy. Only 1 of 12 patients with detectable PSA immediately after radical prostatectomy has had a durable response to adjuvant radiation therapy. In contrast 7 of 13 patients with a delayed increase in PSA had a durable response. The ability of adjuvant radiation therapy to eliminate serum PSA in patients with a delayed increase in PSA after radical prostatectomy is encouraging. However, longer followup, including the use of nonradiated control subjects, is needed to assess the ability of adjuvant radiation therapy to control local disease and prolong patient survival. \nCombined portal vein and liver resection for carcinoma of the biliary tract. Twenty-nine patients with advanced carcinoma of the bile duct or gallbladder underwent combined portal vein and liver resection. Segmental excision of the portal vein was performed in 16 cases and wedge resection of the vessel wall in 13. The operative mortality rate was 17 per cent. The median survival for the 24 patients who left hospital was 19.8 months. Actuarial survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years for all 29 patients were 48 per cent, 29 per cent, and 6 per cent respectively, whereas the median survival for 46 patients with unresectable carcinoma was 3 months and the 1 and 3-year actuarial survival rates were 13 per cent and zero respectively. This difference in survival times between patients undergoing hepatectomy with portal vein resection and those with unresectable carcinoma were statistically significant (P less than 0.01). Combined portal vein and liver resection is recommended as a reasonable surgical approach in selected patients with advanced carcinoma of the biliary tract. \nSoluble interleukin 2 receptor levels in serum and its relationship to T cell abnormality and clinical manifestations of the disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with alterations in immune regulation that results in T cell activation and release of the soluble interleukin 2 receptors (sIL-2R) in serum. SLE, a disease with varied clinical manifestations also has regulatory T cell subset abnormalities in blood. Levels of sIL-2R in serum of patients with active SLE were higher than in those with other common rheumatic diseases. Patients with active SLE and an increased percentage of CD4+ CDw29+ helper inducer (memory) and decreased percentage of CD4+ CD45R+ suppressor inducer (virgin) T cell subsets in blood demonstrated elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum. When compared with clinical manifestations of the disease, the sIL-2R levels in the sera of the patients with active SLE and thrombocytopenia were higher (mean 1710 units/ml) than those in active SLE with nephrotic syndrome (mean 1230 units/ml) or in active SLE with central nervous system disease (mean 1157 units/ml). However, patients with active SLE with humoral immunodeficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia) had highly elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum as compared to other patients with active SLE. The highly elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum may indicate that in vivo T cell activation plays an important role in this disease. \nPredictive value of ventricular arrhythmias for patency of the infarct-related coronary artery after thrombolytic therapy. In animal studies reperfusion of coronary arteries is commonly accompanied by ventricular arrhythmias. It is not certain, however, whether ventricular arrhythmias can be used as a reliable non-invasive marker of reperfusion in humans. Two-channel Holter recordings were obtained from the start of an intravenous infusion of streptokinase until coronary angiography (2.8 (2.7) hours (mean SD)) afterwards) in 57 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than four hours who were generally not treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 21 (37%) of the 57 patients: accelerated idioventricular rhythm in 13 patients and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 15 patients. Seven patients had both accelerated idioventricular rhythm and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiography showed a patent infarct-related vessel in 12 (92%) of the 13 patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm (95% confidence interval 66 to 99%), in 22 (50%) of the 44 patients without accelerated idioventricular rhythm (95% CI 34 to 66%), in 11 (73%) of the 15 patients with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (95% CI 45 to 92%), and in 23 (55%) (95% CI 39 to 71%) of the 42 patients who did not have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Seventeen (81%) of the 21 patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm, or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, or both, had a patent infarct-related vessel (95% CI 58 to 94%) as did 17 (47%) of the 36 patients with no ventricular arrhythmia (95% CI 29 to 65%). In patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm after thrombolysis the infarct-related vessel is almost certain to be patent; but the infarct-related coronary artery can still be patent when no arrhythmia is seen. \nClinical usefulness of amitriptyline in fibromyalgia: the results of 23 N-of-1 randomized controlled trials. Twenty-three double blind, randomized, multiple crossover trials (N-of-1 RCT) of amitriptyline were conducted in patients with fibromyalgia. The benefit of amitriptyline was assessed using a symptom questionnaire and count of tender points. To assess the usefulness of the method, the proportion of trials that provided a definite answer was examined. Completing the trial resulted in reaching a high degree of confidence in the final management decision in 74% of trials. In 35% of trials, results led to discontinuation of the drug which otherwise would have been continued indefinitely. The drug benefit, if present, was evident within first 2 weeks of therapy. We concluded that these results support the feasibility and usefulness of N-of-1 RCT in rheumatology practice. \nFatal varicella-zoster virus meningoradiculitis without skin involvement. A 77-year-old man with T-cell lymphoma developed an acute fatal meningoradiculitis of cranial nerve roots and cauda equina, pathologically and virologically confirmed to be caused by varicella-zoster virus. This is the first report of fatal varicella-zoster virus-induced neurological disease in the absence of skin lesions. Varicella-zoster virus should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute radiculoneuropathy in the immunocompromised patient, particularly because antiviral treatment for varicella-zoster virus exists. \nSituational and psychophysiological factors in psychologically induced pain. To investigate pain that occurs in the absence of painful stimulation, normal subjects were connected to a sham stimulator and were told that a headache could occur as a result of the electrical current they would receive. Half of the subjects who received this suggestion reported pain. The frequency and intensity of pain reports in a group which was given prior pain experience as a reference point in reporting pain and in a group which was exposed to a manipulation designed to reduce intentional deception were not significantly different from the pain reports of a group not exposed to these manipulations. The frequency of pain reports in subjects not connected to the sham stimulator but still asked to report pain was 25% which was significantly less than the frequency for subjects who were told there would be stimulation to the head. Pain ratings increased as the settings of the sham stimulator were increased. Subjects who reported pain had significantly fewer electrodermal responses to tones signaling them to prepare for a reaction time task. The results suggest that pain can be produced in the absence of peripheral stimulation. The pain does not appear to be due to intentional deception or the lack of a standard for comparison, but is strongly influenced by environmental cues. Psychophysiologically, pain responders were less attentive to signal stimuli. \nRelationship of HBsAg subtypes with HBeAg/anti-HBe status and chronic liver disease. Part I: Analysis of 1744 HBsAg carriers. A total of 1744 HBsAg carriers were investigated to determine whether there are clinical differences among HBsAg subtypes or not. Although adr was more predominant than adw in 1078 asymptomatic carriers as well as in 666 carriers with liver dysfunction, the adr carriers had liver dysfunction more frequently than the adw carriers (p = 0.005). In addition, the adr carriers were more often positive for HBeAg and less often positive for anti-HBe than the adw carriers (p less than 0.001). Multivariate analyses indicated that the HBsAg subtypes were associated with liver dysfunction not directly but through the relationship between the HBsAg subtypes and HBeAg/anti-HBe status. HBeAg/anti-HBe status of each age bracket in the adr carriers and in the adw carriers suggested that adr carriers are seroconverted later than adw carriers. In conclusion, HBsAg subtypes may affect the development of chronic liver disease, through their association with HBeAg/anti-HBe status. \nRecurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after partial hepatectomy: value of treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. The usefulness of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of the hepatic artery was retrospectively evaluated in 66 patients who underwent the procedure for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma that recurred after partial hepatectomy. The materials infused were Gelfoam sponge or Gelfoam sponge plus Lipiodol and an anticancer agent. A control group of 15 patients with recurrent tumor received oral anticancer agents alone. The cumulative survival rate for the TACE group was 88% for the first year, 57% for 2 years, 42% for 3 years, and 27% for 5 years, whereas that of the control group was 80% for the first year, 27% for 2 years, and 18% for 3 years. Thus, the prognosis of the TACE group was significantly better (p less than or equal to .01, log-rank test) than that of the control group. The survival rate was inversely correlated with the ratio of the volume of the recurrent tumor to the volume of the whole residual liver. These results suggest that TACE is more effective than oral chemotherapy for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma that recurs after partial hepatectomy. \nSuppression of chronic myelogenous leukemia colony growth by interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist and soluble IL-1 receptors: a novel application for inhibitors of IL-1 activity. In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the malignant evolution of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and the functional activity of IL-1 inhibitors. Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) low-density cells from 38 CML patients were studied in the colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, megakaryocyte colony culture assay. Samples from patients with early stage, interferon-alpha (IFN)-sensitive disease formed hematopoietic colonies in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS), erythropoietin (Epo), and one of the following: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10 ng/mL), IL-3 (15 ng/mL), both, or phytohemagglutinin-conditioned medium. The addition of IL-1 beta augmented IFN-sensitive CML colony growth in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 10 to 100 U/mL. In sharp contrast, addition of the above growth factors did not augment the colony growth-promoting effect of FCS and Epo in samples from IFN-resistant patients; further, adherent cell fractionation or T-lymphocyte depletion attenuated the \"autonomous\" colony growth. Lysates of 2.5 x 10(7) low-density cells from each of six IFN-resistant and six IFN-sensitive CML patients and three normal volunteers were tested for intrinsic IL-1 beta content in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and yielded a mean of 610 pg, 54.6 pg, and 49.4 pg of IL-1 beta, respectively (P less than .045). Interestingly, both soluble IL-1 receptors (sIL-1R) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) at concentrations of 5 to 100 ng/mL (sIL-1R) and 10 to 500 ng/mL (IL-1RA) inhibited CML colony growth in a dose-dependent fashion, with maximal inhibition of 64% and 65%, respectively. A similar effect was noted with the use of anti-IL-1 beta neutralizing antibodies. These data implicate IL-1 beta in CML disease progression and suggest that the inhibitory effects of molecules such as sIL-1R and IL-1RA could conceivably be the basis of a novel therapeutic strategy against this disorder. \nThe incontinent myelodysplastic patient. Urinary incontinence is a socially devastating aspect of the lives of many myelodysplastic children. Incontinence results from abnormal bladder storage function, urethral sphincteric incompetence, or both. Unfortunately, the vesicourethral dysfunction in an individual patient cannot be discerned from the level of the vertebral defect or the coexisting neurologic deficits. Therefore, thorough urodynamic assessment is required to identify altered physiology precisely and to guide rational treatment. Our therapeutic armamentarium includes external devices, intermittent self-catheterization, pharmacologic therapy, prosthetics, electrical stimulation, biofeedback, and innovative surgical procedures. Comprehensive evaluation, thoughtful tailoring of therapy to the individual patient, and a commitment by the urologist to indefinite follow-up will enable most patients to attain social continence while preserving renal function. \nEffect of plasma from patients with essential hypertension on vascular resistance in the isolated perfused rat kidney. 1. Isolated perfused rat kidneys were used to study the effects of plasma fractions obtained by gel filtration from essential hypertensive patients (n = 40) and from normotensive subjects (n = 36) on resistance vessels. Perfusion pressure was recorded at a constant flow. 2. Plasma fractions were obtained by gel filtration and contained substances with a molecular mass in the range 1000-1500 Da. The plasma fractions from hypertensive patients used in this study had been shown to increase blood pressure after intravenous injection in rats. 3. In the isolated rat kidneys, the hypertensive fractions increased perfusion pressure by 20 +/- 17 mmHg (mean +/- SD, range 5-58 mmHg, n = 40). The analogous fractions from normotensive subjects did not change perfusion pressure significantly. 4. In Ca2(+)-free medium containing 2 mmol/l ethyleneglycol bis-(aminoethyl ether)tetra-acetate, the change in perfusion pressure induced by active plasma fractions was reduced by 95.2 +/- 6.3%. Addition of nifedipine to the perfusion medium reduced, but did not abolish, the pressure response of the kidneys. 5. In solutions containing phentolamine or saralasin, vasoconstriction was not reduced. 6. Thus in the active fractions from hypertensive plasma, a vasopressor agent with direct action on resistance vessels can be demonstrated. This substance probably acts by increasing Ca2+ influx in vascular smooth muscle cells. \nDNA diagnosis for hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (Dutch type) Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (HCHWA-D) is tightly linked to the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21, which codes for the amyloid beta-protein. A point mutation detected at position 1852 of the amyloid precursor protein gene in four HCHWA-D patients was hypothesized to be the basic defect. This study proves that 22 HCHWA-D patients from three pedigrees all carry this point mutation, whereas the mutation is absent in escapees from the HCHWA-D families as well as in randomly selected Dutch individuals. A mutation-specific oligonucleotide is now available for the confirmation of the HCHWA-D diagnosis. Therefore, presymptomatic testing and prenatal evaluation of individuals at risk in the HCHWA-D families is now feasible. \nAbdominal distension in female patients with irritable bowel syndrome: exploration of possible mechanisms. Abdominal distension is a common but little understood symptom of the irritable bowel syndrome. The authenticity of the symptom was confirmed by appreciable increases in girth measurement during the day in 20 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome compared with 20 control subjects. Objective corroboration of this finding was shown in the group with the irritable bowel syndrome by a highly significant increase in lateral abdominal 'profile' on computed tomography. Previously postulated mechanisms for distension--namely, retention of gas, depression of the diaphragm, and excess lumbar lordosis--were excluded by the radiological findings. Voluntary protrusion of the abdomen produced a completely different pattern on computed tomography to that observed in the irritable bowel syndrome. These observations suggest that abdominal distension may be related to changes in motility or tone of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. \nBuspirone: sedative or stimulant effect? OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of initial and continued administration of buspirone on sleep induction and maintenance and sleep stage parameters, to determine the presence or absence of any drug-induced side effects, and to ascertain the presence or absence of sleep disturbances following abrupt withdrawal of the drug. METHOD: Six insomniac subjects who had chronic complaints of difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep and who were in good physical health, were not suffering from any major mental disorders, and had not used any medication for at least the last month participated in a 16-night sleep laboratory protocol. The protocol consisted of 4 placebo-baseline nights, 7 nights on which buspirone, 10 mg at bedtime, was administered, and 5 placebo-withdrawal nights. RESULTS: Wake time after sleep onset increased moderately during the first 3 nights of drug administration (there was a marked and significant increase on the first night) and increased by lesser degrees with continued drug administration. Overall, reports of side effects were infrequent. Following drug termination, there was a delayed and mild increase in sleep difficulty above baseline. CONCLUSIONS: These data not only confirm that buspirone lacks sedative effects but also suggest that the drug may have stimulant properties. Further, these findings suggest that buspirone has limited usefulness in anxious patients with concomitant sleep difficulties. \nClustering of features of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome: evidence for a complex genetic locus von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (HLS), an autosomal-dominant inherited disease, was studied in 92 affected subjects from 29 kindreds. In an initial survey to identify HLS gene carriers, all patients treated at the University of Freiburg for angiomatosis retinae (22), haemangioblastoma of the central nervous system (CNS) (63), and phaeochromocytoma (54) were examined as potential HLS gene carriers. HLS was diagnosed in 86% of the patients with angiomatosis retinae, 19% of the patients with haemangioblastoma of the CNS, and 19% of the patients with phaeochromocytoma. Based on these and on an additional 49 newly diagnosed cases (24 by clinical examination and 25 by pedigree analysis), the calculated prevalence of the disease in the district of Freiburg, Germany, with a population of 1.909 million is 1/38 951. There was a striking tendency for familial clustering of HLS features in affected kindreds. Both angiomatosis retinae and haemangioblastoma of the CNS occurred in most families, whereas renal lesions and/or pancreatic cysts and phaeochromatocytoma were mutually exclusive. This finding suggests that HLS is caused by different mutations within a complex genetic locus, or additional genetic lesions, which cooperate with the HLS gene on chromosome 3p. The data point to a linear sequence of features as follows: phaeochromocytoma, angiomatosis retinae, haemangioblastoma of the CNS, renal lesions, pancreatic cysts, and epididymal cystadenoma. \nImprovement by acetylcysteine of hemodynamics and oxygen transport in fulminant hepatic failure. BACKGROUND. When administered early after an overdose of acetaminophen, intravenous acetylcysteine prevents hepatic necrosis by replenishing reduced stores of glutathione. How acetylcysteine improves the survival of patients with established liver damage induced by acetaminophen, however, is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether the beneficial effect of acetylcysteine under such circumstances could be due to enhancement of oxygen delivery and consumption. METHODS. We studied the effect of acetylcysteine on systemic hemodynamics and oxygen transport in 12 patients with acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and 8 patients with acute liver failure from other causes. The acetylcysteine was given in a dose of 150 mg per kilogram of body weight in 250 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 15 minutes and then in a dose of 50 mg per kilogram in 500 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 4 hours; measurements were made before treatment began and after 30 minutes of the regimen. RESULTS. In the patients with acetaminophen-induced liver failure, the infusion of acetylcysteine resulted in an increase in mean oxygen delivery from 856 to 975 ml per minute per square meter of body-surface area (P = 0.0036), due to an increase in the cardiac index from 5.6 to 6.7 liters per minute per square meter (P = 0.0021). Mean arterial pressure rose from 88 to 95 mm Hg (P = 0.0054) despite a decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1296 to 1113 dyn.sec.cm-5 per square meter (P = 0.027). There was an increase in oxygen consumption from 127 to 184 ml per minute per square meter (P = 0.0007) associated with an increase in the oxygen-extraction ratio from 16 to 21 percent (P = 0.022). The effects in the patients with acute liver failure from other causes were similar. CONCLUSIONS. The increase in oxygen delivery and consumption in response to acetylcysteine may account for its beneficial effect on survival in patients with fulminant hepatic failure induced by acetaminophen. \nA case of pheochromocytoma associated with meningioma. We have recently observed a rare case of pheochromocytoma associated with meningioma. To determine the mechanism of such a coexistence in this particular case, we compared the constitutional and pheochromocytoma genotypes of the patient using polymorphic four DNA markers, and we found a loss of heterozygosity at the D1S7 locus. A loss of heterozygosity at this locus has previously been reported by Mathew et al. in pheochromocytoma patients, and our results were in agreement with that study. Therefore the allelic deletion at the D1S7 locus may be an important step in the tumorigenesis of pheochromocytoma in this case. \nMidbrain vs. pontine medial longitudinal fasciculus lesions: the utilization of masseter and blink reflexes. Masseter (MR) and blink reflexes (BL) were investigated in 51 patients with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) due to multiple sclerosis (28) and lacunar infarction (23). The MR was abnormal in 20 of 23 cases with bilateral INO and in 21 of 28 with unilateral INO. The R1 component of the BL (BL-R1) was abnormal in 7 of 23 patients with bilateral INO and 10 of 28 with unilateral INO. Combined MR and BL-R1 changes occurred in 8 of 28 cases with unilateral INO and 7 of 23 with bilateral INO. The findings provide evidence for a rostral/caudal localization of lesions within the medial longitudinal fasciculus causing INO on the basis of MR and BL-R1 abnormalities. An abnormality limited to MR suggests a midbrain location in 58.8% of patients while abnormal BL-R1 with or without an associated MR change suggests a rostral pontine location in 35.3%. \nFalse-positive immunostaining of normal epithelia and carcinomas with ascites fluid preparations of antimelanoma monoclonal antibody HMB45. HMB45 is a melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody that has found widespread use in diagnostic pathology. Recent reports, however, have suggested that this antibody may cross-react with a small number of carcinomas and other epithelial cells. The authors tested the hypothesis that these latter reports represent examples of false-positive immunostaining by comparing the immunostaining on breast, salivary gland, and lung tumors with the following: (1) a commercial ascites preparation of this monoclonal antibody; (2) a protein A-purified antibody preparation derived from ascites fluid; and (3) supernatant fluid obtained from the hybridoma cell line. The authors found that all examples of nonmelanoma immunostaining in the carcinomas tested were eliminated with the nonascites fluid preparations, whereas strong immunostaining of melanomas was retained. The authors conclude that contaminated commercial ascites fluid preparations of HMB45 may account for most, if not all, of the reports of nonmelanoma immunostaining with HMB45. \nIncreased susceptibility to lung dysfunction in female smokers. The interaction between sex and smoking habits on pulmonary function was examined among 1,149 adults 25 to 59 yr of age in a rural community in Saskatchewan. Pulmonary function tests included FVC, FEV1, maximal midexpiratory flow rate (MMFR), the slope of phase III of the single-breath nitrogen test (delta N2/L), and closing volume as a percent of vital capacity (CV/VC). The data show that after fixing the effects of age, height, and weight by analysis of covariance, the adjusted means of delta N2/L in nonsmokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers were 0.92, 1.10, and 1.60% in women and 0.97, 1.05, and 1.23% in men, respectively. The difference in the adjusted means for delta N2/L between smokers and nonsmokers was larger in women than in men, 0.67% versus 0.26%, respectively. Multiple multivariate analyses show that the regression slopes for the residuals of FEV1, MMFR, and delta N2/L versus pack-years were significantly different between men and women. The regressions of FEV1 and MMFR decreased and the regression of delta N2/L increased with increasing pack-years more rapidly in women than in men. The combined effect of sex and pack-years on pulmonary function was not significant for ex-smokers. These data suggest that cigarette smoking may be more detrimental in its effects on lung function in women than in men. \nDevine exclusion for unresectable carcinoma of the stomach. Between July 1986 and July 1988, Devine exclusion was performed in 20 patients with unresectable carcinoma of the gastric antrum. All 20 patients presented with repeated vomiting. On endoscopy, 16 patients had complete gastric outlet obstruction while the remainder manifested significant gastric outlet stenosis. There was no hospital mortality. All except two patients could take an oral diet after surgery until their demise. Devine exclusion is safe and effective in relieving gastric outlet obstruction and is not associated with prolonged delay in return of gastric emptying. \nDescending thoracic aortofemoral bypass as an alternative for aortoiliac revascularization. We performed descending thoracic aorta to femoral",
