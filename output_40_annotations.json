        "text": "l protein synthesis. Cell number was not affected by TNF alpha. Northern analysis of steady state BGP mRNA revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the BGP/cyclophilin mRNA hybridization signal intensity after 24 h of treatment. The maximum inhibitory effect was 41 +/- 5% of the control value with 100 ng/ml TNF alpha. The effect of TNF alpha on steady state BGP mRNA levels was not prevented by treatment of cells with cycloheximide, suggesting that TNF-induced new protein synthesis was not required for TNF alpha action. These results suggest that the mechanism of TNF alpha inhibition of BGP synthesis includes a pretranslational site and support the hypothesis that TNF alpha inhibits bone formation by a selective inhibition of matrix protein production. \nC4A deficiency and poor prognosis in patients with IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) is an important cause of end-stage renal failure in persons of Asian and European descent. We performed C4 phenotyping on plasma from 123 patients with IgA nephropathy who resided in several different parts of the United States. All of these patients underwent diagnostic renal biopsy in adulthood. Six patients had a total deficiency for the C4A protein and all six had chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentration higher than 1.4 mg/dl at last follow-up). In contrast, 47% of the patients without C4A deficiency had chronic renal insufficiency (p = 0.001). The C4 gene defect was due to deletion of both C4A genes in only two individuals, whereas three patients were heterozygous for the C4A gene deletion. We speculate that the functional alteration of the complement system related to C4A deficiency might lead to expression of clinically severe disease in an individual with a genetic susceptibility to IgA nephropathy. \nA comparative immunohistochemical study of Kuru and senile plaques with a special reference to glial reactions at various stages of amyloid plaque formation. The authors examined 10 patients with Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and 10 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunohistochemistry using anti-prion protein (PrP) and anti-beta/A4 protein (beta/A4) coupled with formic acid pretreatment could detect Congophilic and non-Congophilic deposits. Prion protein deposits were classified into five types and compared with types of beta/A4 deposits. Kuru plaques with multicentric cores and fine granular deposits were a characteristic feature of PrP deposits. Some types of PrP or beta/A4 deposits depend on the anatomic sites. To clarify the relationship of microglia and astrocytes to PrP or beta/A4 deposits, double-immunostaining method was performed. In both kuru and senile plaques, microglia were closely linked to the Congophilic plaques. Astrocytes, however, extended their processes toward the plaques even in the non-Congophilic plaques. These observations strongly suggest that similar glial association with plaque formation may be involved in both kuru and senile plaques, although the amyloid core proteins differ. \nDeterminant selection in murine experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Effect of the bm12 mutation on T cell recognition of acetylcholine receptor epitopes. C57BL/6 (B6) mice respond to immunization with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from Torpedo californica as measured by T cell proliferation, antibody production, and the development of muscle weakness resembling human myasthenia gravis. The congenic strain B6.C-H-2bm12 (bm12), which differs from B6 by three amino acid substitutions in the beta-chain of the MHC class II molecule I-A, develops a T cell proliferative response but does not produce antibody or develop muscle weakness. By examining the fine specificity of the B6 and bm12 T cell responses to AChR by using T cell clones and synthetic AChR peptides, we found key differences between the two strains in T cell epitope recognition. B6 T cells responded predominantly to the peptide representing alpha-subunit residues 146-162; this response was cross-reactive at the clonal level to peptide 111-126. Based on the sequence homology between these peptides and the T cell response to a set of truncated peptides, the major B6 T cell epitope was determined to be residues 148-152. The cross-reactivity of peptides 146-162 and 111-126 could also be demonstrated in vivo. Immunization of B6 mice with either peptide primed for T cell responses to both peptides. In contrast, immunization of bm12 mice with peptide 111-126 primed for an anti-peptide response, which did not cross-react with 146-162. Peptide-reactive T cells were not elicited after immunization of bm12 mice with 146-162. These results define a major T cell fine specificity in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis-susceptible B6 mice to be directed at alpha-subunit residues 148-152. T cells from disease-resistant bm12 mice fail to recognize this epitope but do recognize other portions of AChR. We postulate that alpha-148-152 is a disease-related epitope in murine experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. In this informative strain combination, MHC class II-associated determinant selection, rather than Ag responsiveness per se, may play a major role in determining disease susceptibility. \nTransesophageal echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac source of embolism in stroke patients. To compare the diagnostic yields of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism, 63 patients (mean +/- SD age 63 +/- 15 [range 18-87] years) with transient ischemic attacks or stroke underwent both procedures. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a potential cardiac source of embolism in 14% (nine) of the patients, all of whom had clinical evidence of heart disease. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a potential cardiac source of embolism in 41% (26) of the patients; 27% (seven) of these patients had no clinical cardiovascular abnormalities. Abnormalities detected only by transesophageal echocardiography in the patients with unsuspected cardiac disease included atrial septal aneurysm in two, patent foramen ovale in two, left atrial appendage thrombus in one, and myxomatous mitral valve in two. The 26 patients with an identified cardiac source of embolism were older (67.5 versus 59.4 years, p = 0.04), more frequently in atrial fibrillation (62% [16] versus 8% [3], p less than 0.0001), had a larger left atrium (43 versus 37 mm, p = 0.01) and more commonly had left ventricular hypertrophy (62% [16] versus 32% [12], p less than 0.02) than the 37 patients in whom no cardiac source of embolism was identified. Thus, transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism in patients with cerebral ischemic events. \nLocalization and needle aspiration of breast lesions: complications in 370 cases. A prospective study of the immediate complications of 370 consecutive breast-imaging procedures (203 wire localizations and 167 radiographically or sonographically guided fine-needle aspirations) is reported. Vasovagal reactions occurred in 27 (7%) of 370 cases, ranging in severity from syncope (four of 370, 1%) to mild light-headedness. These vasovagal reactions were independent of procedure type or use of local anesthesia, but were more common in younger patients. Other complications included prolonged (5 min or longer) bleeding (three of 370, 1%) and extreme pain (two of 370, 1%). One patient was found to have malignant hypertension. We conclude that wire localizations and imaging-guided aspirations are generally well tolerated procedures. However, vasovagal reactions are frequent enough to warrant close observation of patients. Radiologists and breast-imaging personnel should be able to recognize and treat vasovagal reactions. \nResponse of atrial natriuretic factor to acute and chronic increases of atrial pressures in experimental heart failure in dogs. Role of changes in heart rate, atrial dimension, and cardiac tissue concentration. BACKGROUND. This study evaluated the role of changes in heart rate, atrial pressure, volume, and cardiac tissue atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentration in the modulation of plasma ANF concentration in a model of pacing-induced heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS. The effects of acute right ventricular pacing (250 beats/min), acute volume expansion (35 ml/min), and volume expansion after 1 week of right ventricular pacing on plasma ANF concentration were compared in eight dogs (group 1). As shown during right ventricular pacing previously, volume expansion produced significant increases in cardiac filling pressures and left atrial volume. Right ventricular pacing and volume expansion produced similar increments in plasma ANF concentration: from 32 +/- 12 to 168 +/- 153 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) and from 32 +/- 9 to 137 +/- 113 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), respectively. When pacing was initiated after volume expansion, plasma ANF concentration increased further to 462 +/- 295 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) despite little change in filling pressures and left atrial volume. With repeated volume expansion after 1 week of pacing, there were no significant further increases in left atrial volume and plasma ANF concentrations (from 332 +/- 121 to 407 +/- 113 pg/ml) despite significant increases in filling pressures. Atrial and ventricular tissue samples were also obtained from 21 dogs paced to severe heart failure (group 2) and from 14 normal dogs (controls). In all groups, atrial ANF was higher than ventricular ANF concentration. At 1 week (group 1), left atrial appendage ANF concentration (6.2 +/- 2.5 versus 16.1 +/- 10.3 ng/mg) was reduced, whereas left ventricular free wall ANF concentration (0.62 +/- 0.31 versus 0.24 +/- 0.16 pg/mg) was increased compared with that of controls (both p less than 0.001). At severe heart failure (group 2), atrial ANF remained low, whereas ventricular ANF concentration was similar to that of the controls. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that in pacing-induced heart failure, changes in heart rate, atrial pressure, and volume all contribute to the increased plasma ANF concentration. However, by 1 week (early heart failure), ANF release is attenuated, perhaps because of the inability of the atria to be stretched further and because of reduced atrial ANF concentration. In addition, the ventricle may be an additional source of ANF. \nLymphocytic adenohypophysitis: a pituitary mass lesion occurring in pregnancy. Proposal for medical treatment. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is a nonneoplastic, autoimmune cause of pituitary enlargement and insufficiency. Forty-eight of the 50 reported cases have occurred in women, nearly all in association with pregnancy. Left undiagnosed and untreated, it can progress to pituitary insufficiency and death. Histologic studies show characteristic changes of autoimmune disease with lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of anterior pituitary tissue with fibrotic replacement. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is currently diagnosed after other pituitary mass lesions are excluded and has been treated with a combination of neurosurgery and end-organ hormone replacement. However, with improved knowledge of the pathophysiologic characteristics and natural history of the disease and with the ability to make a prospective diagnosis, we believe glucocorticoids may suppress the inflammatory response and protect remaining pituitary tissue. Two previously unreported pregnancy-associated cases are described, including one prospectively diagnosed and treated without neurosurgery during pregnancy. Obstetrician-gynecologists must place lymphocytic adenohypophysitis in the differential diagnosis of pituitary enlargement associated with pregnancy, since treatment is available and the sequelae may be life-threatening. \nHepatocellular carcinoma in Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii): evidence for association with hepatitis B-like virus infection. During studies of seasonal obesity, a high frequency of hepatic neoplasms was observed in Richardson's ground squirrels. Of 12 Richardson's ground squirrels examined thoroughly, 7 had mild or moderate degrees of chronic portal hepatitis and 6 (50%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Serological tests for hepadnavirus surface antigen, anti-core antibody and virion DNA that recognize the ground squirrel hepatitis virus of California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) were uniformly negative. Southern blot analyses of EcoRI digests of liver cell DNA demonstrated 3.2 kb fragments that hybridized with a ground squirrel hepatitis virus-specific probe in nontumorous liver tissue from 6 of 10 ground squirrels and in hepatocellular carcinoma specimens from 2 of 5 squirrels indicating infection with a hepadnavirus related to ground squirrel hepatitis virus. Failure, however, to detect serum antibody to ground squirrel hepatitis core antigen suggested probable antigenic differences between the ground squirrel hepatitis virus of California ground squirrels and the putative Richardson's ground squirrel agent. Further studies are required to fully characterize the hepadnavirus of Richardson's ground squirrels and to determine its relationship to hepatocarcinogenesis in this species. \nExperimental induction of heterotopic bone. Heterotopic bone can be induced in experimental animals by trauma to the soft tissues, by induction from living cells, or by extracts from bone and teeth. In the first two types, the mechanism of the inductive process is not known, whereas in the latter, a factor isolated from bone matrix induces bone formation. Mesenchymal cells in bone marrow are determined for development into cartilage and bone cells and only an unspecific stimulus, such as trauma or autotransplantation, is sufficient for the development into mature osteogenic tissue. Mesenchymal cells will not differentiate into bone cells unless stimulated by a specific inductive substance, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Implanted to a heterotopic site, BMP induces undifferentiated mesenchymal cells into a bone morphogenetic pathway of development, causing heterotopic bone formation. The quantitative inductive response is dependent on the source of the BMP, and the bone formation is also determined by the recruitment of inducible target cells and by the environment at the implantation site. Hence, the environment at the implantation site is of major importance for the amount of bone formed. BMP initiates a cascade of events that is modulated by endocrine and paracrine factors. The heterotopic bone has all the morphologic and biochemical characteristics of orthotopic bone, is subjected to turnover, and even has the intriguing ability to generate the formation of bone marrow. Experimental induction of heterotopic bone has become a most useful method to study osteoneogenesis and has supplied important information on the prerequisites for new bone formation and on the regulation of bone metabolism. \nMechanisms of failure of mitral valve repair: an echocardiographic study. Surgical valve repair for mitral regurgitation has significant advantages over valve replacement, but little is known about the mechanisms of its failure. This echocardiographic study examined abnormalities leading to failed mitral valve repair in two populations: \"immediate failure\" of the valve repair in the operating room requiring a second run of cardiopulmonary bypass and \"late failure\" of valve repair necessitating reoperation on another occasion. Intraoperative echocardiography (IOE) after cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in 309 patients undergoing valve repair for mitral regurgitation over a 3-year period. Twenty-six (8%) of these patients had immediate failure of the repair demonstrated by IOE, requiring further repair or replacement during the same thoracotomy. The causes of immediate failure were left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (10 patients), incomplete correction (10 patients), and suture dehiscence (six patients). Echocardiography was performed on 17 patients requiring reoperation for recurrent mitral regurgitation who had undergone previous primary valve repair. These late failures resulted from progressive degenerative leaflet or chordal disease (n = 9) or suture dehiscence of the annular ring or the leaflet resection site (n = 6). In only two patients early in the series did the problem originate from inadequate initial surgery. IOE is an effective marker for unsuccessful mitral valve repair, and affords an understanding of the mechanism of the persistent dysfunction. Immediate failure of mitral repair may be reduced by greater attention to the mechanism of valve dysfunction and by changes in valvuloplasty technique to avoid outflow tract obstruction. Late failure after mitral repair occurs predominantly due to progression of disease, particularly in patients with severe myxomatous or annular abnormalities that are prone to progress. \nSleep apnea and systemic hypertension: a causal association review. OBJECTIVE: To critically examine the causal association between sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension. METHODS: A retrospective systematic critique of five epidemiologic studies published in the English literature during 1978 to 1989 identified on Medline and manual literature searches. The evidence was evaluated using the standard observational criteria for causation: strength of association, consistency, dose-response relationship, temporal sequence, specificity, and biologic plausibility. RESULTS: We found evidence to support a causal association between sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension in consistency and specificity and some evidence to suggest a dose-response relationship. Review of the data dealing with the mechanisms important in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea and hypertension allowed us to advance several theories to provide support for biologic plausibility. CONCLUSION: We concluded that there is a positive association--relative risk estimate between 1.3 and 40--for sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension, but the risk association is unstable. Thus, we believe that there is insufficient data to justify doing polysomnography as part of the routine diagnostic work-up for patients with hypertension. \nAccessory receptors regulate coupling of the T-cell receptor complex to tyrosine kinase activation and mobilization of cytoplasmic calcium in T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells have abundant cytoplasmic CD3/Ti but express low amounts on the cell surface and are deficient in CD3/Ti-mediated signal transduction. Nevertheless, plating T-ALL cells on dishes containing immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies with a source of growth factors induced the expression of CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain) and stimulated the formation of blast colonies in 12 of 14 cases studied. The proliferative response to CD3 ligation was modulated by the presence of antibodies to the CD2, CD4, or CD8 accessory T-cell receptors. The effect of these accessory receptors on signal transduction mediated by CD3/Ti was next investigated by monitoring cytoplasmic calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) and by measuring tyrosine phosphorylation after stimulation. Crosslinking CD3, CD2, CD4, or CD8 alone did not induce cytoplasmic calcium mobilization in T-ALLs, but crosslinking the accessory receptors with CD3/Ti induced calcium responses in three of the T-ALLs and enhanced calcium responses in three of the T-ALL cell lines, including HPB-ALL, MOLT-4, and CEM. Crosslinking CD4 but not CD2 with CD3/Ti greatly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates in comparison with crosslinking either CD4 or CD3/Ti separately on both normal mature T cells and the CEM T-ALL cell line. Thus, CD4 regulates CD3/Ti signal transduction in T-ALL cells through the tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates whereas CD2 may regulate [Ca2+]i signal transduction through a separate mechanism. \nDouble-inlet ventricle presenting in infancy. II. Results of palliative operations. The influence of palliation on survival was studied in 191 consecutive infants, presenting at under 1 year of age, with double-inlet ventricle (1973 to 1988, median follow-up 8.5 years). Palliative operations were performed on 154 occasions in 121 patients (63%). Survival after a systemic-pulmonary arterial shunt (n = 57) and banding of the pulmonary trunk (n = 35) was comparable (84% and 77% at 1 year, 62% and 45% at 5 years), but those who underwent repair of aortic arch obstruction fared worse (n = 18, 44% and 22% at 1 and 5 years, p less than 0.001). The remainder did not undergo an operation because of balanced physiology (n = 17, 9% of entire group), complex anatomy (n = 32, 15%), or irreversible low output (n = 19, 12%). Palliative surgery, overall, had a deleterious effect on immediate survival (greater than 1 month relative risk 6.6, p less than 0.001), but, in the survivors, medium-term outcome was improved (greater than 6 months, 0.68, p less than 0.05). This effect was most marked for those undergoing a systemic-pulmonary artery shunt (less than 1 month, 2.52; greater than 6 months, 0.43); by contrast, after banding of the pulmonary trunk, with or without additional repair of the aortic arch repair, medium-term risk was not altered (greater than 6 months, 1.13 and 0.91, respectively). These data will assist the clinician in making decisions concerning the management of infants with double-inlet ventricle and in the judicious use of palliative surgery. \nEffect of intraoperative aprotinin administration on postoperative bleeding in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass operation. To study the hemostyptic effect of aprotinin (Trasylol) in patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation for coronary artery bypass operations, we randomized 12 of 24 patients to receive aprotinin in high dosage (about 800 mg) during extracorporeal circulation. From the resulting two groups each, one patient was excluded from the study because of postoperative myocardial infarction (control group) and surgical hemorrhage (aprotinin group) leading to a second operation. Although heparin was used for anticoagulation in all 22 patients, all had a marked increase in plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes during extracorporeal circulation, indicating an intravasal activation of coagulation. By monitoring the plasma levels of fibrin degradation products in patients without aprotinin therapy, we recorded a concomitant hyperfibrinolysis significantly less pronounced in patients receiving aprotinin (p less than 0.005). The mean total postoperative blood loss was lower in patients receiving aprotinin (620 ml) than in control patients (1000 ml; p less than 0.03). The results confirm previous reports of a hemostyptic effect of aprotinin in cardiac operations. This effect is probably due to a prevention of hyperfibrinolysis. \nGout and hyperuricemia. Accurate diagnosis is essential since gout is overdiagnosed by a factor of three. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not associated with adverse consequences and should not ordinarily be treated. The acute attack of gout responds to any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and antihyperuricemic therapy with allopurinol, probenecid or sulfinpyrazone is effective in lowering uric acid and preventing further attacks. Except for prophylaxis, colchicine is not recommended for the treatment of gout because of unacceptable levels of toxicity. Diet therapy, once a mainstay of treatment, is usually not indicated since drug therapy alone is far more efficacious. \nReduced cerebral grey matter observed in alcoholics using magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-eight chronic alcoholics and 36 age- and sex-matched non-alcoholic controls were examined with magnetic resonance imaging and brain morphometric analyses. Results confirmed large increases in subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume and mild ventricular enlargement in the alcoholics and revealed associated volume reductions of localized cortical and subcortical cerebral structures. Volume losses in the diencephalon, the caudate nucleus, dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortex, and mesial temporal lobe structures were the most prominent. Significant correlations between increments in cortical and ventricular CSF and decrements in the volume of cortical and subcortical grey matter were noted. Although there was little evidence for relationships between performance on neuropsychological tests and volume of grey matter structures, significant correlations between some cognitive measures and subcortical and cortical fluid volumes were found. The parallels between this pattern of affected structures and recent neuropathological findings are discussed. \nPathogenesis of edema in constrictive pericarditis. Studies of body water and sodium, renal function, hemodynamics, and plasma hormones before and after pericardiectomy. BACKGROUND. The pathogenesis of sodium and water accumulation in chronic constrictive pericarditis is not well understood and may differ from that in patients with chronic congestive heart failure due to myocardial disease. This study was undertaken to investigate some of the mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using standard techniques, the hemodynamics, water and electrolyte spaces, renal function, and plasma concentrations of hormones were measured in 16 patients with untreated constrictive pericarditis and were measured again in eight patients after pericardiectomy. The average hemodynamic measurements were as follows: cardiac output, 1.98 l/min/m2; right atrial pressure, 22.9 mm Hg; pulmonary wedge pressure, 24.2 mm Hg; and mean pulmonary artery pressure 30.2 mm Hg. The systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances (36.3 +/- 2.5 and 3.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg.min.m2/l, respectively) were increased. Significant increases occurred in total body water (36%), extracellular volume (81%), plasma volume (53%), and exchangeable sodium (63%). The renal plasma flow was only moderately decreased (49%), and the glomerular filtration rate was normal. Significant increases also occurred in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (3.6 times normal), renin activity (7.2 time normal), aldosterone (3.4 times normal), cortisol (1.4 times normal), growth hormone (21.8 times normal), and atrial natriuretic peptide (5 times normal). The ratio of left atrial to aortic diameter measured by echocardiography was only minimally increased (1.29 +/- 0.04), indicating that in constrictive pericarditis the atria are prevented from expanding. The studies repeated after pericardiectomy in the eight patients showed that all measurements returned toward normal. CONCLUSIONS. The restricted distensibility of the atria, in constrictive pericarditis, limits the secretion of atrial natriuretic factor and, thus, reduces its natriuretic and diuretic effects. This results in retention of water and sodium greater than that occurring in patients with edema from myocardial disease. The arterial pressure is maintained more by the expansion of the blood volume than by an increase in the peripheral vascular resistance. \nTransient penetration of the hip joint during in situ cannulated-screw fixation of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Before the routine intraoperative use of fluoroscopy at our institution during procedures to stabilize a slipped capital femoral epiphysis, twenty-five patients (thirty hips) had in situ cannulated-screw stabilization of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis with use of biplane radiography. Thus, a permanent record of the procedure was available for review. Fourteen hips in fourteen patients had an intraoperative episode during which the joint was penetrated by the guide-pin assembly or cannulated screw, or both. This penetration was corrected at the time of the operation. Eleven patients were followed for a minimum of two years (mean, thirty-nine months; range, twenty-four to sixty-three months). All physes went on to closure. None of the patients had clinical or radiographic evidence of chondrolysis. Transient penetration of the hip joint did not lead to chondrolysis in this series. This suggests that a single episode of penetration by a pin or screw, with immediate removal from the joint, is not associated with the development of chondrolysis. \nMassive hepatic enlargement with fatty change associated with ketoconazole Several forms of hepatic toxicity have been described with the antifungal agent ketoconazole. We report a case of massive liver enlargement with fatty infiltration presenting as gastric compression. This occurred in a young woman with AIDS taking ketoconazole as maintenance therapy for cryptococcal meningitis. This is the first reported case of ketoconazole causing fatty change in the liver. \nAngelchik prosthesis complicates treatment of adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Indications for use of the Angelchik prosthesis remain controversial, and many surgeons actively involved in the treatment of reflux disease have not used the device. We describe a case that illustrates difficulties associated with resection of a tumor in the presence of this prothesis. Such experience suggests that patients known to have Barrett's esophagus might be better treated with standard antireflux procedures. \nAppendicitis: prospective evaluation with high-resolution CT. Computed tomography (CT) was used to prospectively evaluate 100 patients with clinical indications for acute appendicitis. Examinations were performed with the terminal ileum and cecum filled with contrast material. Acute appendicitis was diagnosed when an abnormal appendix or inflammatory changes plus an appendicolith were detected. Failure to visualize an abnormal appendix or appendicolith in the presence of pericecal inflammatory changes was considered suspicious but nonspecific. CT results were correlated with surgical and pathologic results (74 patients) and other radiologic and clinical findings (26 patients). CT helped to diagnose appendicitis (64 patients) and nonspecific right lower quadrant inflammation (five patients) and to rule out appendicitis (31 patients). CT had a 98% sensitivity, an 83% specificity, and a 93% accuracy. In 17 of 31 patients without CT evidence of appendicitis, other conditions explaining their symptoms were detected. When the clinical diagnosis is in doubt, CT can be used successfully to evaluate patients with acute appendicitis. \nSyndrome of the cervical plexus caused by high cervical nerve root compression. Lesions affecting the roots of the cervical plexus can cause a syndrome not previously described. The C3-C4 disc space is the most likely to be involved, but pressure on the C5 root can also produce facial, auricular, or retroauricular pain. Motor innervation to the diaphragm can be affected, and even the uppermost disc space at C2-C3 might be implicated. Findings on examination findings are sparse, although sensory impairment in areas of cervical plexus innervation has been observed. In a series of 1000 cervical decompression cases (both anterior and posterior) for disc disease or similar processes, only 10 instances of this syndrome have been found. Paresthesia or episodic shock-like pain affecting the ear, para-auricular, lower occipital, and mandibular areas prompted by head turning or extension are the most common complaints. \nFast short-tau inversion-recovery MR imaging. To enhance the versatility of the short-tau inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences, the authors determined a range of repetition time (TR) and inversion time (TI) combinations that suppress signal intensity from fat by study of both patient and phantom images. To make fast STIR images, variations in the following pulsing conditions were studied with use of an interactive computer program: decreasing the TR, limiting the number of excitations, and limiting the number of phase-encoding steps. The authors found that (a) STIR imaging need not be time consuming, (b) fat suppression can be accomplished at shorter TR by using shorter TI, and (c) short-TR fast STIR imaging is sensitive to enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine. \nAntibody responses to protein, polysaccharide, and phi X174 antigens in the hyperimmunoglobulinemia E (hyper-IgE) syndrome. To investigate whether an underlying defect in antibody (Ab)-forming capacity could contribute to the infection susceptibility of patients with hyper-IgE syndrome, we evaluated 11 such patients for their responses to bacteriophage phi X174 (phi X174), diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and pneumococcal (Pneumovax) and Hemophilus influenzae vaccines. Three of nine patients immunized with phi X174 had normal primary and secondary Ab responses, five had accelerated declines in their titers after initially normal primary Ab responses and lower than normal secondary Ab responses, and two of the latter patients failed to switch normally from IgM to IgG Ab production. Only one of 10 patients tested had normal Ab responses to diphtheria toxoid, and postimmunization antitetanus titers were abnormally low in five of the 10 patients tested. Serum Abs to H. influenzae polyribose phosphate were protective in seven of the eight immunized patients. Five of the nine patients administered Pneumovax had poor Ab responses to at least one of the pneumococcal serotypes 7, 9, or 14. Abnormal antipolysaccharide responses did not correlate with IgG2 deficiency. All patients responded with protective Ab levels to type 3. Thus, patients with hyper-IgE syndrome are heterogeneous with respect to their Ab-forming capacities. Ab deficiency may contribute to infection susceptibility in some of these patients. \nImmunohistochemical expression of galactomannan in the cytoplasm of phagocytic cells during invasive aspergillosis. The monoclonal antibody EB-A1 to galactomannan is apparently specific for detecting Aspergillus species and Penicillium marneffei in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. It reveals hyphae, remnants of filaments, and organisms in the cytoplasm of some phagocytic cells. \nSuccessful transcatheter embolization of pseudoaneurysm associated with pancreatic pseudocyst. Hemorrhage into a pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare event, but is the most rapidly lethal complication of chronic pancreatitis. Visceral-vessel aneurysms are an unexpectedly common finding in arteriography of patients with chronic pancreatitis. This case report describes bleeding from an anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm, caused by chronic pancreatitis. The aneurysm was successfully treated by embolization with a steel coil. \nSuccessful operation on a coronary arteriovenous fistula in a 74 year old woman. Coronary arteriovenous fistulas are rare and are usually diagnosed in children or young adults. Most are believed to be congenital. A right coronary arteriovenous fistula was first diagnosed in a patient of 74. Despite her age the fistula was successfully operated on and her symptoms were relieved. \nAntifungal treatment by amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine delays the recovery of normal hematopoietic cells after intensive cytostatic therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. Systemic fungal infections are recognized at increasing frequency during the course of intensive therapy for acute leukemias and require parenteral antifungal treatment mostly by amphotericin B (ampho B) alone or in combination with 5-Fluorocytosine (5-FC). Because of the potential myelosuppressive side effects of 5-FC it was the aim of the current study to evaluate the recovery of hematopoietic cells after intensive antileukemic therapy in patients receiving ampho B and 5-FC treatment for proven or suspected systemic fungal infections. The study population comprised 87 patients who were treated by standard chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at first diagnosis or relapse. Twenty-two patients underwent systemic antifungal therapy consisting of ampho B (3 to 10 mg/kg/d) and 5-FC (150 mg/kg/d) for 3 to 33 days (median, 12 days). The remaining 65 patients served as controls to assess the hematologic recovery time (TR) as defined by the interval between the onset of chemotherapy and the post-treatment rise of granulocyte levels to greater than 500 cmm and thrombocyte levels to greater than 20,000 cmm. In patients receiving antifungal therapy, a significant prolongation of TR was observed with a median TR of 29 days compared with a median TR of 24 days (P = 0.0016) for the control group. No correlation was found between TR and the total dose of either ampho B or 5-FC or the type of antileukemic regimen. A possibly direct myelosuppressive effect of a fungal infection was unlikely to explain the findings because the ampho B/5-FC treatment was started in patients with proven or only suspected fungal infections, causing a similar delay of TR in both groups. The present data strongly suggest a myelosuppressive effect of ampho B/5-FC antifungal treatment in patients after intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemias. \nPostoperative deficits and functional recovery following removal of tumors involving the dominant hemisphere supplementary motor area. The supplementary motor area (SMA) is a region located within each cerebral hemisphere at the posterior mesial border of the frontal lobe adjacent to the falx. The functional significance of this area has been somewhat unclear, and information regarding its influence on motor output has largely been based on evoked responses to direct stimulation in primates and humans. In this series of patients with primary and metastatic tumors involving the dominant hemisphere SMA, a distinct pattern of postoperative deficits and recovery has emerged which emphasizes the role of this critical area in the initiation of motor activity, including speech. Based upon this analysis, ablation of this region after first identifying the primary motor cortex may be accomplished without risk of permanent loss of motor activity or speech function, despite the initial severe deficits. \nA case of photosensitivity and contact allergy to systemic tricyclic drugs, with unusual features. A 43-year-old farmer on tricyclic antidepressive drugs developed a severe photodermatitis with associated liver involvement. The lesions spread to covered areas of the skin, suggesting photoallergy clinically. Patch and photopatch testing revealed photoallergy and contact allergy to clomipramine and contact allergy also to carbamazepine. In addition, the patient had positive patch test reactions to chlorpromazine, balsam of Peru and fragrance-mix, as well as a positive photopatch test to fentichlor. UVA and UVB erythema thresholds were normal. In this patient, an initial episode of photosensitization, probably elicited by clomipramine, was accompanied by contact allergy to this drug and to carbamazepine. The contact sensitivity to clomipramine could also be elicited by oral provocation without UV light. Hypothetically, a photoproduct of clomipramine may have been the original sensitizer, this compound subsequently cross-reacting with clomipramine and, possibly with carbamazepine. \nHypophosphatemic osteomalacia in von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis. Skeletal lesions are not uncommon in von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis. Most of them are considered to be dysplastic in nature. Association of osteomalacia or rickets with neurofibromatosis has been documented only rarely. Reported herein is a 40-year-old woman with known von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis who presented with bone pain, multiple pseudofractures, marked increase in osteoid by bone biopsy, and hypophosphatemia with renal phosphate wasting. Treatment with oral phosphate and vitamin D was effective. A survey of the literature revealed that 34 similar cases have been reported in the past. Although the exact pathogenetic mechanism remains to be determined, osteomalacia in neurofibromatosis appears to be distinct from more common dysplastic skeletal affections of this disease, being characterized by later onset in adulthood as a rule, renal phosphate loss with hypophosphatemia, multiple pseudofractures in typical cases, and response to treatment with pharmacological dose of vitamin D with or without phosphate supplement. \nOccult metastatic neck disease: detection with US and US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology. The authors performed a prospective study of the value of ultrasonography (US) and US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for assessment of N0 lesions in the neck. Preoperative US was performed in 107 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who underwent 132 elective neck dissections. During the US examination of the last 54 patients, who underwent 70 elective neck dissections, US-guided FNAC was performed. US alone was found to be an unreliable method for detecting occult lymph node metastasis; the accuracy never exceeded 70% (93 of 132), with a sensitivity of 60% (32 of 53) and a specificity of 77% (61 of 79). In contrast, US-guided FNAC had an accuracy of 89% (62 of 70), a sensitivity of 76% (25 of 33), and a specificity of 100% (37 of 37). Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of US-guided FNAC for the assessment of the N0 neck, this modality may play an important role in directing treatment of these patients in the future. \nImpact of temperature elevation on immunologic defenses. Fever is a common response to infection and to other challenges to host defense. Temperature elevation has been associated with effects on the recognition, recruitment, and effector phases of the immune response. Specific immunologic responses are generally enhanced in the setting of temperature elevation within the physiologic range but not the supraphysiologic range. In contrast, natural immune responses may be unchanged or adversely affected. Temperature elevation appears to affect primarily the phase of recognition and sensitization or activation of mononuclear leukocytes. T lymphocyte responses (and/or the interactions of T lymphocytes with monocytes-macrophages) are enhanced for generation of effector cells. The activities of the effector cells, once generated, are usually not enhanced--or may even be depressed--by temperature elevation, but decreases are more than offset by increased T helper function. Overall, the data suggest that temperature elevations of the febrile response constitute a beneficial component of effective host defense. \nPericardial mass mimicking constrictive pericarditis. Persistent pericardial hematoma due to blunt chest trauma is extremely rare. We report a case of constricted myocardium resulting from a large, partially organized hematoma in the right cardiophrenic angle. The hematoma was assumed to be caused by an occupational accident 17 years before diagnosis. Constriction could only be controlled by complete removal of the fibrous posterior capsule of the hematoma, which covered the epicardium of the right heart. \nPaediatric haemangiomas: the role of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy currently maintains an occasional place in the therapy of complicated haemangiomas of childhood. Eight such childhood benign lesions have been so treated at St Bartholomew's Hospital in the last 10 years. The case histories are presented before being discussed in the context of other therapies available (no treatment, steroids, embolism and surgery), radiation technique used and radiation dose prescription advised. \nCavoatrial tumor thrombectomy using cardiopulmonary bypass without circulatory arrest. Of 29 patients with inferior vena caval tumor thrombus, 14 with supradiaphragmatic extension were deemed suitable for operation. Patients (age, 7.5 to 70 years) had renal cell carcinoma (n = 8), Wilms' tumor (n = 2), transitional cell carcinoma (n = 1), and adrenal carcinoma (n = 3). Seven patients had stage III disease, and 7 patients had stage IV disease. Two patients (group A) had unresectable disease at exploratory celiotomy, 4 patients (group B) underwent tumor thrombectomy without cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardiopulmonary bypass was employed in 8 patients (group C). Three of 8 group C patients had Budd-Chiari syndrome at diagnosis. Cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia, and inferior vena caval interruption (clip or filter), was employed in all patients. There were no perioperative deaths. Transient neurological impairment was observed postoperatively in 2 patients. Coagulopathy developed in 1 patient who had hepatic encephalopathy and Budd-Chiari syndrome preoperatively and in another patient in whom protamine could not be administered. No patient had acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Median survival is 41 and 17 months in groups B and C, respectively. Some authors have advocated profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest in these patients. We find that satisfactory visualization and excision can be performed with cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia, avoiding potential renal, hepatic, neurological, and septic complications associated with circulatory arrest. \nTransplantation after first-stage reconstruction for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The surgical treatment of infants born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome has received considerable attention in recent years. Although this lesion was previously considered uniformly fatal, dramatic successes have been achieved with the use of staged reconstructive and replacement therapies. However, both surgical options have benefits and limitations, and neither has demonstrated clear superiority over the other. As survival for first-stage reconstruction by the Norwood procedure has improved, a greater number of patients are potential candidates for the Fontan operation, but not all will be suitable at an acceptable risk. These patients may be treated by cardiac transplantation. The results of a treatment protocol for 90 patients with classic hypoplastic left heart syndrome or its variants at The University of Michigan are reported, with particular attention given to those patients surviving initial palliation but judged to be unsuitable for a subsequent Fontan procedure. \nStaurosporine facilitates recovery from the basal forebrain-lesion-induced impairment of learning and deficit of cholinergic neuron in rats. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the loss of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert and by a primary loss of memory function. Since staurosporine has been reported to induce differentiation in human neuroblastoma cells in vitro, we studied the effects of staurosporine on the amnesia induced by basal forebrain-lesion in rats. Staurosporine (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneal) attenuated the impaired performance of water maze and passive avoidance tasks, even though the drug administration began 2 weeks after the lesion. Moreover, staurosporine (0.1 mg/kg) partially reversed the decrease of choline acetyltransferase activity in the fronto-parietal cortex induced by basal forebrain-lesion. These results suggest that staurosporine attenuates impairment of learning through reversal of damage to cholinergic neurons induced by basal forebrain-lesion. This evidence indicates that neurotrophic factor-like substances may be used in novel therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer's disease. \nPerioperative total parenteral nutrition in surgical patients. The Veterans Affairs Total Parenteral Nutrition Cooperative Study Group BACKGROUND. We undertook this study to test the hypothesis that perioperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN) decreases the incidence of serious complications after major abdominal or thoracic surgical procedures in malnourished patients. METHODS. We studied 395 malnourished patients (99 percent of them male) who required laparotomy or noncardiac thoracotomy. They were randomly assigned to receive either TPN for 7 to 15 days before surgery and 3 days afterward (the TPN group) or no perioperative TPN (the control group). The patients were monitored for complications for 90 days after surgery. RESULTS. The rates of major complications during the first 30 days after surgery in the two groups were similar (TPN group, 25.5 percent; control group, 24.6 percent), as were the overall 90-day mortality rates (13.4 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively). There were more infectious complications in the TPN group than in the controls (14.1 vs. 6.4 percent; P = 0.01; relative risk, 2.20; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 4.05), but slightly more noninfectious complications in the control group (16.7 vs. 22.2 percent; P = 0.20; relative risk, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 1.13). The increased rate of infections was confined to patients categorized as either borderline or mildly malnourished, according to Subjective Global Assessment or an objective nutritional assessment, and these patients had no demonstrable benefit from TPN. In contrast, severely malnourished patients who received TPN had fewer noninfectious complications than controls (5 vs. 43 percent; P = 0.03; relative risk, 0.12; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.91), with no concomitant increase in infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS. The use of preoperative TPN should be limited to patients who are severely malnourished unless there are other specific indications. \nConsequences of queuing for care at a public hospital emergency department OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the length of a queue at a public hospital emergency department was associated with increased likelihood of patients' leaving without being seen by a physician and whether leaving adversely affected patients' health or affected their subsequent use of health care services. DESIGN: Observational cohort. Patients were surveyed during 1 week in July 1990 and received a follow-up survey 7 to 14 days later. The responses of patients who left without being seen by a physician were compared with those who were seen by a physician. SETTING: Emergency department at San Francisco (Calif) General Hospital. PATIENTS: All English-, Spanish-, and Cantonese-speaking adults waiting for emergency care were eligible. Of 882 eligible individuals, 700 agreed to participate; 85% of enrolled subjects saw a physician and 15% left without being seen. Demographic characteristics of patients who were and who were not seen were not significantly different. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Emergency department waiting time and changes in patients' self-reported health. RESULTS: Patients were more likely to leave as waiting times increased. At follow-up, patients who left without being seen were twice as likely as those who were seen to report that their pain or the seriousness of their problem was worse. Only 4% of patients who left required subsequent hospitalization, but 27% returned to an emergency department. CONCLUSION: Many patients can appropriately decide whether their problem is truly urgent and make alternative plans in the face of long waits, but the health of some patients may be jeopardized by long queues for emergency care. \nThe hyperekplexias and their relationship to the normal startle reflex. The startle response to unexpected auditory and somaesthetic stimulation was studied in 8 patients with hereditary or symptomatic hyperekplexia. It was abnormal in its resistance to habituation and in its exaggerated motor response. Both noise and taps to the face and head elicited a normal early blink response, separate from the subsequent true startle reflex. The earliest reflex EMG activity recorded after the blink was in sternocleidomastoid. EMG activity in masseter, and trunk and limb muscles followed later. This pattern of muscle recruitment suggests a brainstem origin for the abnormal startle responses. In addition, the abnormal startle responses exhibited disproportionately long latencies to the intrinsic hand and foot muscles and relatively slow recruitment of caudal muscles. The pattern of muscle recruitment was similar between patients, irrespective of the absolute latency of the response, and regardless of whether stimulation was auditory or somaesthetic. This suggests that auditory and somaesthetic afferents converge on a common brainstem efferent system, and that this system forms the final common pathway for abnormal startle responses of differing latency. The characteristics of this efferent system differ from those previously described in brainstem reticular reflex myoclonus, but are similar to those described in the normal auditory startle reflex in man. This suggests that the abnormal startle response in hyperekplexia, and the normal startle reflex represent pathological and physiological activity in the same brainstem efferent system. \nFour years of North American registry home parenteral nutrition outcome data and their implications for patient management. The OASIS Registry started annual collection of longitudinal data on patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in 1984. This report describes outcome profiles on 1594 HPN patients in seven disease categories. Analysis showed clinical outcome was principally a reflection of the underlying diagnosis. Patients with Crohn's disease, ischemic bowel disease, motility disorders, radiation enteritis, and congenital bowel dysfunction all had a fairly long-term clinical outcome, whereas those with active cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had a short-term outcome. The long-term group had a 3-year survival rate of 65 to 80%, they averaged 2.6 complications requiring hospitalization per year, and 49% experienced complete rehabilitation. The short-term group had a mean survival of 6 months; they averaged 4.6 complications per year and about 15% experienced complete rehabilitation. The registry data also indicated HPN was used for 19,700 patients in 1987 with therapy growth averaging about 8% per year. This growth was chiefly from new cancer patients. The number of new patients with long-term disorders in whom HPN was initiated appeared rather constant. We conclude that these clinical outcome assessments justify HPN for long-term patients, but the utility and appropriateness of HPN for the cancer and AIDS patients remains uncertain and requires further study. Medical, social, and fiscal aspects of HPN management in long-term and short-term patients appear to involve quite separate considerations. \nCan decision analysis help in the management of giant hemangioma of the liver? [editorial] We explore the trade-off between the risk and expected benefits from resection of giant liver hemangioma (GLH), one larger than 4 cm in diameter. We searched the English-language literature for studies of the postoperative mortality after resection of GLH and of the outcome of expectantly treated patients. The results of the data synthesis showed an operative mortality of 1.5% (90% confidence intervals, 0.1-3.0%) and an early surgical morbidity of up to 13%. Mortality among the 37 reported cases with ruptured GLH was 78%. There were no cases of spontaneous or traumatic rupture of unresected GLH during a follow-up of a total of 282 patient years. The main source of ambiguity regarding the management of GLH is the uncertain risk of its rupture. Rough estimates of this risk based on published data suggest that surgical resection is not justified in asymptomatic GLH. Yet, although rare, rupture of GLH does occur with disastrous consequences. Future research may attempt to define patient subsets whose GLHs are at higher risk of rupture, and in whom preventive resection may improve survival. \nEvidence of a selective increase in cardiac sympathetic activity in patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias BACKGROUND. Although enhanced efferent cardiac sympathetic nervous activity has been proposed as an important factor in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, direct clinical evidence has been lacking. METHODS. We measured the rates of total and cardiac norepinephrine spillover into the plasma, which reflect respectively overall and cardiac sympathetic nervous activity, in 12 patients who had recovered from a spontaneous, sustained episode of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation outside the hospital 4 to 48 days earlier. The results were compared with those from three age-matched reference groups without a history of ventricular arrhythmias: 12 patients with coronary artery disease, 6 patients with chest pain but normal coronary arteries, and 12 healthy, normal subjects. RESULTS. The patients who had had ventricular arrhythmias had reduced left ventricular ejection fractions, as compared with the patients with coronary artery disease or chest pain (mean [+/- SE], 46 +/- 3 percent vs. 58 +/- 4 percent and 69 +/- 5 percent, respectively; P less than 0.003). The rates of total norepinephrine spillover into the plasma were similar in the three reference groups, but 80 percent higher in the patients with ventricular arrhythmias (P less than 0.005). The rate of cardiac norepinephrine spillover was 450 percent higher in these patients (176 +/- 39 pmol per minute, as compared with 32 +/- 8 pmol per minute in the normal subjects; P less than 0.001), a disproportionate increase relative to the increase in total spillover, which indicated selective activation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow. This increase in cardiac norepinephrine spillover was probably caused by a reduction in left ventricular function. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that in some patients major ventricular arrhythmias are associated with and perhaps caused by sustained and selective cardiac sympathetic activation. We speculate that depressed ventricular function was present before the ventricular arrhythmia occurred, and that this resulted in reflex cardiac sympathetic activation, which in turn contributed to the genesis of the arrhythmia. \nSebaceous carcinoma: an unusual cause of a rapidly enlarging rhinophyma. We describe a patient who developed sebaceous carcinoma within a long-standing rhinophyma with rapid enlargement of the lesion. We believe the development of this tumour was a random occurrence but the possibility of tumour development should be considered in any rhinophyma showing a rapid increase in size. \nEnd-stage avascular necrosis of bone in renal transplant patients. The natural history. We report the results of conservative treatment of stage III and stage IV avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) affecting the hip or knee in renal transplant patients. Twenty-nine patients were followed for a mean period of five years. Conservative management was successful in controlling symptoms in 40% of those with AVN of the hip and in 70% of those with AVN of the knee. Knowledge of the natural history of AVN is important because of the long survival times after renal transplantation. \nSigmoid sinus thrombosis diagnosis by contrasted MRI scanning. Septic thrombosis of the transverse-sigmoid sinuses and the jugular bulb is a highly lethal condition. The presenting signs and symptoms of this disease entity are subtle and not in proportion to the magnitude of the problem. Later in the disease course, sudden fulminant findings appear. A high index of suspicion, combined with scanning techniques of either enhanced MRI or CT, allows prompt diagnosis and treatment. MRI enhanced with gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) is a valuable adjunct that confirms the diagnosis and delineates the extent of suspected pathology. \nEpicardial and endocardial mapping of ventricular tachycardia in patients with myocardial infarction. Is the origin of the tachycardia always subendocardially localized? BACKGROUND. Left ventricular endocardial reentry is the conventional concept underlying surgery for ventricular tachycardia (VT). We assessed the incidences of patterns showing complete reentry circuits at either the subendocardial or subepicardial level and of patterns in which left ventricular endocardial mapping could only in part account for a reentrant mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS. We retrospectively analyzed epicardial and left ventricular endocardial isochronal maps of 47 VTs induced in 28 patients with chronic myocardial infarction (inferior, 14 patients; anteroseptal, 14 patients). Electrograms were recorded intraoperatively from 128 sites with epicardial sock and transatrial left ventricular endocardial balloon electrode arrays. Given the methodology used in this study, the mapping characteristics of the tachycardias suggested five types of activation patterns: 1) complete (90% or more of VT cycle length) subendocardial reentry circuits in seven VTs (15%) and seven patients (25%), 2) complete subepicardial reentry circuits in four VTs (9%) and four patients (14%), 3) incompletely mapped circuits with a left ventricular endocardial breakthrough preceding the epicardial breakthrough in 25 VTs (53%) and 21 patients (75%), 4) incompletely mapped circuits with a left ventricular epicardial breakthrough preceding the endocardial breakthrough in three VTs (6%) and three patients (11%), and 5) a right ventricular epicardial breakthrough preceding the left ventricular endocardial breakthrough in eight VTs (17%) and seven patients (25%). After surgery, one type 3 VT and three type 5 VTs were reinducible. Thus, left ventricular endocardial reentry substrates (types 1 and 3) accounted for 68% of VTs, but substrates involving subepicardial (types 2 and 4) and deep septal layers (type 5) accounted for 32% of VTs. CONCLUSIONS: In a substantial number of VTs, a substrate localization that is at variance with the conventional concept can be detected by simultaneous epicardial and endocardial mapping and may require modification of the surgical approach conventionally aimed at endocardial layers. \nWilliams syndrome: masseter spasm during anaesthesia. A 4-year-old boy with Williams syndrome developed masseter spasm after halothane and suxamethonium. He did not develop malignant hyperthermia; the surgery was accomplished with a nontriggering anaesthetic and no further problems. \nPreherpetic neuralgia. We have encountered six zoster patients whose pain preceded rash by 7 to more than 100 days. Pain was severe, burning, and radicular, and located both in dermatomes different from, as well as in, the area of eventual rash. Two patients ultimately developed disseminated zoster with neurologic complications, one of zoster paresis, and the other, a fatal zoster encephalitis; both had been taking long-term, low-dose steroids. A third case of preherpetic neuralgia developed in a patient with prior metastatic carcinoma, and another case in a patient with an earlier episode of brachial neuritis. The final two cases of preherpetic neuralgia developed in individuals with no underlying disease. An extended period of pain before the onset of zoster rash has gone largely unrecognized. \nClonorchis-associated cholangiocarcinoma: a report of two cases with unusual manifestations. Two cases of Clonorchis-associated cholangiocarcinoma are described along with their cholangiographic features to illustrate the spectrum of pathology ascribed to the injurious effects of the flukes on the bile duct epithelium. This includes adenomatous hyperplasia, extensive fibrosis, and carcinoma. The first case was also complicated by hepatic abscesses, left hepatic lobar atrophy, gastrobiliary and biliarocutaneous fistulae. The second case features an unusually dilated pancreatic duct containing pancreaticoliths that was found later to consist of hyperplastic bile duct epithelium, presumably carried by worm migration in the biliary tree. Liver sections from both patients showed typical features of hepatic clonorchiasis with the cancer. A knowledge of the wide spectrum of clinical presentation of clonorchiasis, particularly cholangiocarcinoma, might aid Western physicians in averting this serious sequela through prompt eradication of the helminthic infection and early recognition and treatment of its complications. \nBiliary lithotripsy: correlation between gallbladder contractility before treatment and the success of treatment. We perform biliary lithotripsy without adjuvant chemolitholytic agents, and therefore fragment clearance depends solely on the gallbladder's ability to evacuate its contents. We studied 205 patients to determine if gallbladder contractility before biliary lithotripsy is a predictor of treatment results and rate of fragment clearance. Percentage gallbladder contraction was calculated from the fractional difference in the sonographically measured gallbladder volumes before and after a fatty meal. Seventy-six patients (37%) were free of stones and fragments, and 129 patients (63%) had residual fragments at comparable follow-up intervals. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in gallbladder contractility before biliary lithotripsy between the fragment-free group and the residual-fragment group (p = .008). Stone burden before treatment showed no significant difference between the groups (p = .074), but the number of stones was significantly less in the fragment-free group (p = .022). In the fragment-free group, a poor correlation (r = .047) was found between the percentage gallbladder contraction and the rate of fragment clearance. These data indicate that contractility of the gallbladder before treatment correlates with overall success of biliary lithotripsy but is not a predictor of the speed of fragment clearance. \nLong-term follow-up and prognostic factor analysis in advanced ovarian carcinoma: the Gynecologic Oncology Group experience. Long-term follow-up was obtained on 726 women with advanced ovarian carcinoma (suboptimal stage III and stage IV) who had received primary chemotherapy on two Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocols between 1976 and 1982. The first study compared melphalan alone versus melphalan plus hexamethylmelamine versus cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin (CA). The second study evaluated the same CA regimen with or without cisplatin. Eligibility for the two studies was the same. At last contact, 76 patients were alive. In a multivariate analysis, cell type other than clear cell or mucinous, cisplatin-based treatment, good performance status, younger age, lower stage, clinically nonmeasurable disease, smaller residual tumor volume, and absence of ascites were favorable characteristics for overall survival (P less than .05). Second-look laparotomy was negative significantly more often among those with endometrioid tumors; there were no negative second-look laparotomies among those with mucinous or clear cell tumors. There were 30 patients with suboptimal stage III disease who had a negative second-look laparotomy; 18 (60%) have experienced recurrence, and 13 (43%) have died. Although cisplatin treatment was beneficial, new treatments are clearly needed. \nRadiolabeled antibody imaging in the management of colorectal cancer. Results of a multicenter clinical study. Presurgical colorectal cancer patients (n = 116) received single intravenous infusions of 1 mg of CYT-103 (OncoScint CR103), an immunoconjugate of monoclonal antibody B72.3, radiolabeled with 111In. Following gamma camera imaging, 103 patients underwent an operative procedure: 92 had primary or recurrent colorectal carcinoma, 1 patient evaluated for recurrence of colorectal cancer had a second primary malignancy (small cell lung), and 10 patients had no demonstrable evidence of malignancy. 111In-CYT-103 immunoscintigraphic findings were consistent with the pathologic diagnoses for 70% of patients with colorectal cancer and 90% of disease-free patients. Antibody imaging contributed to surgical decision making through the detection of occult disease (12% of patients) and the confirmation of localized, potentially resectable disease without regional or metastatic spread. Seven patients (6%) experienced adverse effects, primarily fevers and itching, and 33% of patients developed antibodies to murine immunoglobulin after administration of 111In-CYT-103. The results of this study suggest that 111In-CYT-103 is a useful diagnostic tool for the presurgical evaluation of colorectal cancer patients. \nManagement of infected aortoiliac aneurysms. A 30-year retrospective review identified 13 patients treated for infected aneurysms of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries, for an overall incidence of 0.65%. A constellation of clinical findings led to the correct preoperative diagnosis in 11 (85%) of 13 patients. Treatment methods included resection and in situ replacement grafting in seven patients, resection and extra-anatomic bypass in five patients, and resection-ligation in one patient. Four (31%) of 13 patients died within 30 days of operation, three of whom died of rupture. Overall, good results were achieved in five patients (38%), while poor results were noted in the remaining eight patients (62%). The determinants of outcome were aneurysm location or rupture, the presence of established infection, and the virulence of the infecting organism. In 10 (77%) of the 13 aneurysms, Salmonella species, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for all deaths, ruptures, and suprarenal aneurysm infections. These data suggest that patients with primary infections of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries continue to present with advanced infections or aneurysm rupture that result in a high mortality. \nReduction in the incidence of acute bronchitis by an oral Haemophilus influenzae vaccine in patients with chronic bronchitis in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Following the administration of a standardized questionnaire, 62 adult patients with chronic bronchitis were enrolled into a double-blind controlled trial of an oral killed Haemophilus influenzae vaccine in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. A 3-day course of vaccine or placebo was given monthly for 3 consecutive months. Participants were monitored weekly over 12 months for acute exacerbations; early morning sputum specimens were collected monthly and during acute exacerbations. Density of colonization by H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae was determined by standard quantitative and semiquantitative techniques, and the latter method (quadrant score) was used to determine the density of growth of pneumococci. A total of 30 patients received vaccine and 32 placebo. The incidence rate of acute bronchitis in the vaccine group (0.011 episodes/person-weeks) was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (0.021 episodes/person-weeks), but there was no difference between the two groups in the incidence rates of more severe disease. Vaccine efficacy was maximal at times of peak incidence of disease. There was no evidence of a decline in vaccine efficacy for acute bronchitis over the 12-month follow-up period. The number of viable H. influenzae in the sputum declined in both vaccine and placebo groups over the 12-month follow-up period. The average concentration of H. influenzae in the vaccine group fell below that in the placebo group within 1 to 2 months after first immunization and remained so for 12 months, although the difference between the two groups narrowed during the follow-up period. \nRegenerating nodules in hepatic cirrhosis: MR findings with pathologic correlation. To establish clearly the pathologic basis for small low-intensity nodules seen on MR images of the cirrhotic liver, we obtained MR images in 26 patients with cirrhosis in whom partial hepatectomy for hepatoma (15 patients), laparoscopy for cirrhosis (10 patients), or autopsy (one patient) was subsequently performed. Small low-intensity nodules were seen on gradient-echo images with short TEs (10-13 msec) in 13 of the 26 patients. In 12 of these 13 patients, small low-intensity nodules appeared larger and clearer as the TE was prolonged (14-25 msec). On T2-weighted spin-echo images, small low-intensity nodules were seen in 12 of the 13 patients, but not seen as well as on gradient-echo images. Pathologic correlation in these 13 patients revealed that the nodules on the MR images corresponded to iron deposits in regenerating nodules. Small low-intensity nodules were observed only on T2-weighted spin-echo images in two of the remaining 13 patients, in whom microscopic examination of the liver revealed marked inflammatory cell infiltration in the fibrous septa and no iron deposition. We conclude that small low-intensity nodules observed on MR images are caused by iron deposits in regenerating nodules, and that gradient-echo images with short and prolonged TEs are useful to confirm the presence of iron deposits in regenerating nodules. \nSuture length to wound length ratio and the integrity of midline and lateral paramedian incisions. A total of 349 patients were randomized to undergo laparotomy through a lateral paramedian incision with layered closure (n = 137), a midline incision with mass closure (n = 104) or a midline incision using layered closure (n = 108), endeavouring to close the latter two incisions with a measured suture length to wound length ratio of greater than 4:1. After 18 months follow-up, no patient in the lateral paramedian group had developed an incisional hernia whereas 7 of 104 patients undergoing a midline incision with mass closure and 7 of 108 patients undergoing a midline incision with layered closure had incisional hernias (P less than 0.01). The mean suture length to wound length ratios for the three groups were 2.6 (range 1.3-6.2), 5.0 (range 3.0-8.7) and 3.7 (range 2.0-6.3) respectively (P less than 0.0001). The lateral paramedian incision remains superior to the midline incision closed with the mass technique and its integrity is independent of the suture length to wound length ratio. \nBilateral coronary ostial stenosis associated with aortitis syndrome. A patient with aortitis syndrome showed severe stenosis of the bilateral coronary ostium. We discuss the coronary angiographic findings and the treatment. \nSpontaneous haematomyelia: a necropsy study. Spontaneous haematomyelia (intramedullary spinal haematoma), is an uncommon event. Predisposing conditions have been reported including syringomyelia, pregnancy and delivery, angioma, spinal artery aneurysm, and haemophilia, but only rarely has a pathological evaluation been performed. Two such cases studied at necropsy are reported. In one case, the haematoma was restricted to the cervical spinal cord, while in the second case it extended from the medulla into the lowest thoracic cord segments. In both cases the haematomyelia was fatal. In the first case the clinical course was subacute, but in the other the course was more acute. Careful neuropathological examination showed no apparent cause for the haemorrhages. \nCancer occurrence in a cohort of patients surgically treated for peptic ulcer. A cohort of 4107 patients treated surgically for peptic ulcer between 1955 and 1960 was followed up to determine the incidence of cancer by record linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. A total of 930 cases of cancer were observed during 76,634 person-years. Relative risks of cancer were computed by comparison with the recorded cancer incidence in the Danish population. During the first five years after surgery the relative risk of gastric cancer was slightly increased (RR = 1.43), but 5-15 years after the operation the risk was lower than expected (RR = 0.55). Thereafter, the relative risk of gastric cancer increased steadily and increased more than twofold after 25 years. Lung cancer occurred more frequently in the cohort members than expected (RR = 1.66), but the relative risk was independent of time since surgery. Malignancies other than gastric cancer and cancers related to tobacco smoking were close to the expected numbers. The results do not support the findings of a recent British study of similar size in which increased risks were reported for cancer at other sites. \nInterleukin 4 promotes expression of mast cell ICAM-1 antigen. Cell recognition molecules play a crucial role in the regulation of immune cells. We recently found that mast cells (MCs) express leukocyte recognition molecules, including ICAM-1 antigen, a natural ligand of LFA-1. We here report that interleukin 4 (IL-4), a pleiotropic cytokine and mast cell differentiation factor, selectively promotes expression of surface ICAM-1 antigen and ICAM-1 mRNA in human MCs. IL-4 also up-regulates ICAM-1 antigen in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage but has no effect on ICAM-1 antigen expressed on basophils, fibroblasts, or lymphocytes. The increase in expression of mast cell/macrophage ICAM-1 antigen induced by IL-4 may contribute to the accumulation of leukocytes and facilitate cell-contact-dependent regulation of immune cells in inflamed tissues. \nVisual and quantitative analysis of interictal SPECT with technetium-99m-HMPAO in temporal lobe epilepsy. Interictal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT images were compared to ictal EEG localization in 51 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy to determine their usefulness for preoperative seizure focus localization. Both quantified temporal lobe asymmetry and blinded visual detection of temporal lobe hypoperfusion were employed. Visual analysis detected ipsilateral hypoperfusion in 18 (39%) of the 46 patients with a unilateral focus and contralateral hypoperfusion in 3. None of the five patients with bitemporal foci had unilateral hypoperfusion. The positive predictive value of unilateral temporal lobe hypoperfusion was 86% (18/21). Quantified anterior temporal lobe asymmetry, greater than a previously derived normal range, correctly identified the focus in 22 (48%) but gave the wrong side in 5, resulting in a predictive value of 81%. The degree of asymmetry correlated inversely with age of seizure onset, but not with other clinical parameters, histology, or verbal and nonverbal memory. The usefulness of interictal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT for pre-operative seizure focus localization is limited by low sensitivity when performed with a conventional rotating gamma camera. This suggests that ictal or immediate postictal imaging may be necessary for this purpose. \nAppendicitis in cystic fibrosis. Appendicitis is said to be uncommon and difficult to diagnose in cystic fibrosis. The clinical and radiological features in nine patients with cystic fibrosis who had appendicitis were studied. All but one of the patients had an appendiceal abscess at surgery. Four patients had a delay in diagnosis of greater than three days before the correct diagnosis was made. This delay may have been due to a more indolent presentation or because these patients were initially considered to have distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. Appendicitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis if a contrast enema demonstrates extrinsic compression of the caecum. Ultrasound, computed tomography, and gallium scans were found to be of limited help in our series. \nVitrectomy for premacular fibroplasia. Prognostic factors, long-term follow-up, and time course of visual improvement. Two hundred seventy eyes with premacular fibroplasia consecutively treated by pars plana vitrectomy and membrane peeling were reviewed. This study is among the largest series with long-term follow-up reported to date. Visual improvement of two or more lines was achieved in 43% of eyes at 6 to 12 months, in 54% at 1 to 2 years, in 60% at 2 to 3 years, and in 58% at 3 to 5 years. Overall, complications occurred in 34 eyes (13%). Cataract progression after vitrectomy was noted in 106 (57%) of phakic eyes at 3 to 5 years, and 43 of these eyes underwent subsequent cataract extraction. Mean time to best visual acuity after vitrectomy was slightly less than 1 year for all eyes unless they had cataract worsening with subsequent cataract extraction (1.9 years). Significant factors affecting visual outcome were: preoperative lens status, visual acuity before vitrectomy, duration of preoperative symptoms of distortion and/or blurred vision, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications. \nRetrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section: efficacy in disorders other than Meniere's disease. The retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section has evolved as an effective treatment for intractable vertigo of peripheral vestibular origin when hearing preservation is desired. This report studies the efficacy of retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for control of vertigo due to causes other than Meniere's disease. This report details our experience with 42 patients with a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduced success rate of retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section in these patients is difficult to evaluate, as very few patients have been analyzed with respect to their specific diagnoses. Of patients who underwent retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for control of vertigo, 23 patients had uncompensated vestibular neuritis and 19 others had a wide range of other diagnoses. For patients with uncompensated vestibular neuritis (n = 23), the physician record noted that 39% of patients were cured and 30% improved. This compares to our series of patients with Meniere's disease (n = 48), where 94% were cured and 2% improved. The true vestibular abnormality may be less reliably identified in patients with uncompensated vestibular neuritis, contributing to the less effective results. Since the development of a vestibular rehabilitation program, retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for uncompensated vestibular neuritis has been all but abandoned. Retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section appears to achieve a high cure rate in patients with sensorineural hearing loss associated with their vestibular abnormalities. While retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section is helpful for control of vertigo in some diagnoses, a substantial incidence of persistent postoperative dysequilibrium was noted. \nStudy of experimental pain measures and nociceptive reflex in chronic pain patients and normal subjects. This study evaluates (i) the effect of heterotopic chronic pain on various experimental pain measures, (ii) the relationship between experimental pain measures and chronic pain symptomatology assessment, and (iii) the influence of the various pain aetiologies on experimental pain measures. Fifty-three chronic pain patients were compared to 17 pain-free subjects with the following psychophysical and physiological indices: pain threshold (PTh), pain tolerance (PTol), verbal estimation of intensity and unpleasantness (intensity scale, IS; unpleasantness scale, US), threshold for intensity and unpleasantness (ITh and UTh), lower limb RIII nociceptive reflex (RIIITh and RIII frequency of occurrence). Chronic pain syndromes included neuropathic pain (n = 12), iodopathic pain (n = 12), myofascial syndromes (n = 9), headache (n = 9), and miscellaneous pain (n = 11). Chronic pain symptomatology was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS), a French MPQ adaptation (QDSA), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State Trait Inventory (STAI) and Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). No significant difference was observed between chronic pain patients and pain-free control groups and between patient subgroups for PTh, PTol and RIIITh. No significant correlation was found between experimental pain measures and clinical pain, anxiety or depression scores. However, the chronic pain patients had a higher threshold for unpleasantness and judged the suprathreshold stimuli significantly less intense and less unpleasant than the control group. These results are discussed in relation to diffuse noxious inhibitory controls and the adaptation level theory of chronic pain experience. \nInfluence of racial origin on admission rates of patients with suspected myocardial infarction in Birmingham. All patients with suspected myocardial infarction admitted to hospital in four Birmingham health districts were studied to test the hypothesis that Asian patients would be overrepresented and Caribbean patients underrepresented compared with the indigenous population. One thousand four hundred and ninety six patients had a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction or severe angina pectoris. The relative risk of admission for Asian men compared with white men aged 45-64 years was 2.65 (95% confidence interval 2.20 to 3.19) and the risk for Asian men was high for both myocardial infarction and ischaemia when analysed separately. The relative risk of admission for Caribbean men compared with white men was 0.53 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.20). The relative risk for Asian women compared with white women in the same age group was 2.58 (95% CI 1.68 to 3.96), but this was due to an excess of admissions diagnosed as ischaemia rather than infarction in the Asian women. For Caribbean and white women the risk of admission was the same, although significantly fewer Caribbean women were admitted with myocardial infarction. The study was undertaken in 1986-87 and population data had to be derived from the 1981 census. The resident population changed in those five years and so the results were recalculated making allowances for these changes in the health districts involved. Based on these data the admission rate for Asian men with suspected myocardial infarction aged 45-64 was nearly twice that for white men (1.8): the relative risk of admission for Asian men compared with white men was 2.04 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.18). \nBiopterin-dependent hyperphenylalaninemia due to deficiency of 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase. We describe the clinical, neurologic, and biochemical findings in 10 patients with 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (6-PTS) deficiency from seven families, all of whom originate from one large tribe in Saudi Arabia. This deficiency presents with severe, early onset of failure to thrive, neurologic deterioration, and morbidity and mortality secondary to repeated episodes of bronchopneumonia or cardiorespiratory abnormalities. The urinary pterin excretion pattern indicates deficient activity of 6-PTS, which has been confirmed by direct enzyme assay in red blood cells of three patients. We treated our patients with combined use of tetrahydrobiopterin 20 mg/kg/d, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine 15 mg/kg/d, carbidopa 3.75 mg/kg/d, and L-5-hydroxytryptophan 5 mg/kg/d. Neurologic findings improved significantly in all after 5 to 24 months. Although head circumference and weight returned to the lower limit of normal in four, height normalized only in one of seven patients. Despite an unrestricted diet during combined therapy, blood phenylalanine and urinary excretion of neopterin and biopterin returned to normal. \nAlpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes and alcoholic pancreatitis. Altered frequencies of alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes have been reported in patients with chronic pancreatitis, suggesting a possible genetic basis for individual susceptibility to this disease. Alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes, with particular regard to alcoholic pancreatitis, were studied. Patients with alcoholic pancreatitis were compared with alcoholic control subjects with no history of pancreatic disease. Serum alpha 1 antitrypsin concentrations were raised in pancreatitis patients sampled within one month of an acute attack of pancreatitis, but otherwise values were similar to those of control subjects. There were no significant differences in alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes between alcoholics with pancreatitis and alcoholic control subjects. This study of alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes provides no evidence of an inherited susceptibility to alcoholic pancreatitis. \nPercutaneous coronary mid-infra-red laser angioplasty. A pilot study was performed to determine the safety and efficacy of coronary pulsed mid-infra-red laser angioplasty. The laser was coupled with a novel 2.0 mm multifiber catheter consisting of 37 optical fibers of 150 microns each arranged concentrically around a 0.018-inch central lumen and a soft leading tapered distal tip to maintain coaxial alignment and position plaque in front of fibers. The laser was operated at 500 millijoules/pulse, 3.5 Hz, and 250 microseconds/pulse. Twenty-three patients with stenosis or occlusion of the left anterior descending or right coronary artery were selected for laser treatment. In three patients the catheter could not be positioned against the obstruction. In the 20 remaining patients laser angioplasty increased the diameter of the lumen from 0.3 +/- 0.3 mm to 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm and reduced the stenosis from 91 +/- 8% to 57 +/- 10%. In three patients \"stand-alone\" laser treatment was sufficient. In 17 patients balloon dilatation further reduced the stenosis to 20 +/- 18%. In two patients who had previously undergone unsuccessful balloon angioplasty with high inflation pressure, laser angioplasty allowed subsequent successful dilatation with low inflation pressure. There were no deaths, perforations, dissections, or arrhythmias. One patient had abrupt reclosure 24 hours after the procedure. Spasm occurred in four patients, and six patients had chest sensations during laser emission. Thus mid-infra-red pulsed coronary laser angioplasty is safe and effective for recanalization of stenosed and totally occluded arteries. The efficacy may be sufficient for \"stand-alone\" laser treatment. The technique may improve the efficacy of balloon angioplasty in cases of unsuccessful primary dilatation. \nAssociation of hypovolemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage with computed tomographic scan evidence of raised intracranial pressure. Hypovolemic patients are more likely to suffer delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction after a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Prompt recognition and correction of hypovolemia may improve the outcome. We have identified computed tomographic (CT) scan findings that increase the probability of a patient presenting with hypovolemia soon after an SAH. The plasma volume (PV) of 25 patients admitted within 96 hours of an SAH was measured using radioiodinated serum albumin. The normal PVs were measured in an outpatient setting 6 months later or predicted from their total body water. Nine patients (36%) were found to be hypovolemic, defined as a fall in PV exceeding 10% of the normal PV (mean fall, 18 +/- 2%). Sixteen patients were normovolemic or hypervolemic (mean PV, +9 +/- 2%). The basal cisterns were compressed or obliterated on the CT scans of all hypovolemic patients compared with 12.5% of normovolemic patients (chi-square, 14.52; P less than 0.01). The probabilities of a patient being hypovolemic if the CT scan indicated raised intracranial pressure were high: hydrocephalus, P = 0.80; compression of the basal cisterns, P = 0.82; and compression of the basal cisterns associated with intracerebral hematoma or midline shift, P = 1.00. Patients with an SAH and radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure should be considered at particular risk for systemic hypovolemia. \nCandidal mediastinitis after surgical repair of esophageal perforation. Candidal mediastinitis, like Boerhaave's syndrome, is uncommon, and both, if treated late or incompletely, frequently result in death. Early recognition and aggressive medical and surgical intervention are the best means to convalescence and cure in both conditions. \nVaginal and vulvar adenosis. An unsuspected side effect of CO2 laser vaporization. During a 15-month period, September 1984 through January 1986, 10 women who were treated in the Section of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, developed vaginal or vulvar adenosis after CO2 laser vaporization. The indications for therapy were condylomata of the cervix, vagina and vulva refractory to conservative management in 3 patients, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia in 3, lichen sclerosus in 1 and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with condylomata on the cervix and vagina in 3. All the patients underwent treatment of the vagina. Most underwent treatment of the cervix, and some underwent treatment of the vulva at various degrees of intensity and depth. During the posttreatment colposcopic follow-up examination, all the patients demonstrated lesions colposcopically consistent with adenosis of the vagina or vulva within the area treated with the CO2 laser. Biopsies of the lesions were performed, adenosis was confirmed histologically, and endometriosis was ruled out histologically. This entity has not been previously associated with CO2 laser vaporization, and its clinical significance is undetermined. Further follow-up is indicated. \nIncidence of ultrasound-detected intrahepatic hematomas due to Tru-cut needle liver biopsy. This is a prospective study in which 120 patients with diffuse liver disease undergoing liver biopsy were followed by serial ultrasounds to determine the incidence of postbiopsy intrahepatic hematoma formation. Forty-five of the patients had a blind biopsy, while the remaining 75 patients had a biopsy performed during laparoscopy. In both groups a 2.0-mm Tru-cut needle was employed. The overall incidence of postbiopsy hematoma formation was 18.3%, with approximately the same results occurring in blind biopsy patients (20%) and laparoscopy-guided biopsy patients (17%). Only two patients had significant pain associated with the hematoma formation (one from each group), one of whom had evidence of intraperitoneal bleed and rebleed. Our results suggest that postbiopsy asymptomatic hematomas occur more frequently than had been generally thought and that laparoscopy-guided biopsy is not safer than blind biopsy. \nPulmonary dysfunction in surgical conditions of the newborn infant. OBJECTIVE: To describe the pathophysiology of surgical conditions that are associated with respiratory insufficiency in the newborn infant. DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: Newborn ICU in a children's hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-four newborn infants (1 to 28 days old) who required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for operative procedures or postoperative ventilatory support. INTERVENTIONS: Flow-volume curves obtained by manual inflation of the lungs, followed by forced deflation by negative pressure, and by passive expiration, under sedation and pharmacologic paralysis. MEASUREMENTS: Deflation flow-volume curves and passive expiratory curves were measured. Pulmonary function testing before and after bronchodilator administration (n = 11) began midway during the study period. Term and preterm groups served as controls. MAIN RESULTS: Forced vital capacity (FVC) was decreased in all groups with surgical disease as follows: abdominal wall defects and necrotizing enterocolitis groups to 48.3% and 62.1% that of preterm, respectively; pulmonary hypoplasia group to 55.5% that of term (p less than .05). Maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC decreased in all groups: abdominal wall defects and necrotizing enterocolitis group, to 36.8% and 37.9% that of preterm, respectively (p less than .05); pulmonary hypoplasia group, 20.0% that of term (p less than .05). The ratio of maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC divided by FVC was significantly decreased in necrotizing enterocolitis and pulmonary hypoplasia groups compared with that of preterm and term groups, respectively, but not in the abdominal wall defects group. Maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC, but not FVC, increased significantly (36%, p less than .05) after bronchodilator nebulization, indicating the presence of airway reactivity. Respiratory system compliance was decreased significantly (p less than .05) in all surgical disease groups compared with the term group. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchial reactivity contributes to decreased maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC, a feature also seen in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome who later develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Babies who require chronic ventilatory support after operation and who have developed reactive airways may benefit from the administration of bronchodilators during postoperative ventilatory management. \nAzathioprine induced liver disease: nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver and perivenous fibrosis in a patient treated for multiple sclerosis. Azathioprine hepatotoxicity has been described mainly in renal transplant recipients. Most reported cases are related to lesions of the venous system of the liver: peliosis hepatis, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. The most common clinical manifestation of these hepatic vascular lesions is portal hypertension. We present a case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia and perivenous fibrosis in a patient receiving azathioprine for multiple sclerosis. Histological abnormalities were similar to those described in renal transplant patients, and azathioprine was the only potential hepatotoxic agent present. \nMitochondrial dysfunction in multiple symmetrical lipomatosis. Multiple symmetrical lipomatosis is a striking clinical finding associated with a variety of peripheral and central nervous system abnormalities. We describe 4 unrelated patients with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. Multiple symmetrical lipomatosis is an additional, albeit unusual, manifestation of the expanding clinical spectrum of mitochondrial diseases. \nRole of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in regulation of vascular tone and remodeling. Update on humoral regulation of vascular tone. In addition to preserving the permselectivity of the vascular wall and providing an antithrombogenic surface, the vascular endothelium contributes importantly to the regulation of vasomotor tone. Indeed, the endothelium participates in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II; the enzymatic inactivation of several plasma constituents such as bradykinin, norepinephrine, serotonin, and ADP; and the synthesis and release of vasodilator substances such as prostacyclin and the recently discovered endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). The diffusible EDRF released from the endothelium is nitric oxide or a substance closely related to it such as nitrosothiol. The endothelium also synthesizes and releases vasoconstrictive factors, including products derived from arachidonic acid metabolism and the recently discovered peptide endothelin. An increasing body of evidence from experimental and clinical studies indicates that EDRF and endothelium-derived contracting factors play an important role in vascular physiology and pathology. It has become apparent that the balance of these factors may be a major determinant of systemic and regional hemodynamics. Moreover, through generally opposite effects on growth-related vascular changes, contracting factors such as endothelin and relaxing factors such as EDRF also may be important determinants of the vascular response to injury in various disease states such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. It is clear that the vascular endothelium is a complex and dynamic organ. Understanding endothelium function in normal physiology and disease states is of potential clinical importance and should be the focus of future investigation. \nComparison of an antiinflammatory dose of ibuprofen, an analgesic dose of ibuprofen, and acetaminophen in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee BACKGROUND. The optimal short-term, symptomatic therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee has not been fully determined. Accordingly, we compared the efficacy of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, given in either an antiinflammatory dose (high dose) or an analgesic dose (low dose), with that of acetaminophen, a pure analgesic. METHODS. In a randomized, double-blind trial, 184 patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis were given either 2400 or 1200 mg of ibuprofen per day or 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. They were evaluated after a washout period of three to seven days before the beginning of the study, and again after fo",
