        "text": "tic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88% phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5% increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3% increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs. However, these responses are significant only during ischemia that is transmural and involves the superficial epicardial layers of the left ventricle. \nDNA sequence analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of the HLA-DQw2 alleles associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a blistering autoimmune skin disease associated with a 95-100% incidence of the HLA class II antigen HLA-DQw2. Although the precise role of this antigen in the pathogenesis of DH is unclear, one theory proposes that patients with DH possess a molecularly unique subtype of the HLA-DQw2 antigen that causes immune abnormalities eventuating in the clinical manifestations of DH. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA sequence analysis on the highly polymorphic HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 loci of eight patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. All DQB1 alleles sequenced were identical to the previously described HLA-DQB*0201 allele from HLA-DQw2 normal subjects. In addition, DQA1 alleles sequenced were identical to those alleles previously associated with HLA-DQw2 (DQA*0201, DQA*0501). These data document that although HLA-DQw2 appears to be a necessary element in the pathogenesis of DH, the development of DH is not dependent on the presence of a unique HLA-DQw2 antigen. HLA-DQ allelic typing by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 fragments was also performed in ten patients with DH to determine the allelic distribution among both HLA-DR3 (eight patients) and non-DR3 (two patients) DH patients. At the HLA-DQ beta chain locus, all patients possessed the DQB1*0201 allele. At the HLA-DQ alpha chain locus, all HLA-DR3 patients and one non-DR3 patient displayed a pattern consistent with the DQA1*0501 allele, whereas one non-DR3 patient displayed a pattern consistent with the DQA1*0201 allele. These data document that patients with DH do not express a unique HLA-DQw2 heterodimer, that the HLA-DQw2 molecules present in patients with DH have no DNA sequence differences from those found in normal HLA-DQw2 subjects and therefore that susceptibility to DH is not due to a unique HLA-DQw2 molecule. \nGallium-SPECT in the detection of prosthetic valve endocarditis and aortic ring abscess. A 52-yr-old man who had a bioprosthetic aortic valve developed Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Despite antibiotic therapy he had persistent pyrexia and developed new conduction system disturbances. Echocardiography did not demonstrate vegetations on the valve or an abscess, but gallium scintigraphy using SPECT clearly identified a focus of intense activity in the region of the aortic valve. The presence of valvular vegetations and a septal abscess was confirmed at autopsy. Gallium scintigraphy, using SPECT, provided a useful noninvasive method for the demonstration of endocarditis and the associated valve ring abscess. \nThe pathophysiology of chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in the Lewis rat. Electrophysiological studies were performed in Lewis rats with chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by inoculation with guinea-pig spinal cord and adjuvants and treatment with low dose cyclosporin A. During clinical episodes there was conduction failure in the central nervous system (CNS), namely the spinal cord dorsal columns, and in the afferent fibres in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The following observations indicated that the conduction failure was mainly due to demyelination-induced conduction block: (1) rate-dependent conduction block in the CNS and PNS; (2) temporal dispersion due to slowing of PNS conduction; (3) restoration of PNS conduction by cooling; (4) restoration of CNS conduction by ouabain; (5) previously demonstrated histological evidence of primary demyelination in the dorsal columns, dorsal root ganglia and dorsal roots; and (6) the temporal association of restoration of conduction with remyelination. However, it is likely that CNS and PNS axonal degeneration, which occurs in this disease, also contributed to the conduction failure. In clinical remissions there was restoration of conduction in the CNS and PNS which can be explained by ensheathment/remyelination by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, respectively. In most rats during clinical episodes the cerebral somatosensory evoked potential was reduced in amplitude and prolonged in latency, which can be accounted for by demyelination and axonal degeneration in the CNS and PNS components of the afferent pathway. In 2 rats with episodes of EAE, however, this potential was markedly increased in amplitude, which might have been due to demyelination-induced conduction block of descending pathways that normally inhibit synaptic transmission in the afferent pathway. In well-established remission there was residual conduction failure in the CNS and PNS which can be mainly accounted for by axonal degeneration. \nLow-dose co-trimoxazole for prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in human immunodeficiency virus disease The efficacy and tolerability of low, intermittent doses of co-trimoxazole (160 mg trimethoprim and 800 mg sulfamethoxazole given Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was assessed retrospectively in 116 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex at high risk of PCP. 92% were receiving concomitant zidovudine. 71 with previous episode(s) of PCP were followed a mean of 18.5 months (range 3-42). 45 without past PCP but with depletion of CD4 cells to less than 200/microliters were observed for a mean of 24.2 months (range 9-40). PCP did not develop in any patient on co-trimoxazole. 33 (28%) had side-effects, mainly rash, pruritus, and nausea. 15 discontinued co-trimoxazole, but only 11 (9%), who withdrew in the first month, were clearly drug-intolerant. Thus, low-dose, thrice weekly co-trimoxazole completely prevents AIDS-associated PCP, is cost-effective, and well tolerated by more than 85% of patients. Controlled comparisons of this regimen with other prophylactic agents are warranted. \nAutomated pupil perimetry. Pupil field mapping in patients and normal subjects. The authors developed an automated method of pupil perimetry by linking an infrared video pupillometer to a Humphrey Field Analyzer. Software was developed to automatically analyze the pupil responses to focal light stimuli and display the results graphically. All 76 locations of Humphrey program 30-2 could be tested twice within 5.5 minutes and the relative sensitivity of the field was determined by comparing the amplitude of pupil constriction or latency time at each stimulus location. The mean pupil responses within annular areas at 3 degrees, 9 degrees, 15 degrees, 21 degrees, and 27 degrees were shown to be linearly related to log stimulus intensity over a 15 dB range under low level mesopic conditions (3.15 asb bowl background). In normal subjects, the superior temporal quadrant usually had the greatest mean pupillomotor response and the inferior nasal quadrant had the least. Pupil responses in the temporal field were larger than corresponding locations in the nasal field. Patients with visual field defects who underwent testing by pupil perimetry showed pupillary deficits in the same location within the field, providing evidence that pupil perimetry may be a useful, objective means of assessing visual field function. \nDiltiazem-induced psychosis and a possible diltiazem-lithium interaction. Calcium channel blockers are being used increasingly for a variety of cardiovascular problems. Diltiazem hydrochloride, a benzothiazepine derivative, has been reported to have a low incidence of adverse side effects. We report a case of acute psychosis associated with the use of diltiazem in a patient receiving lithium carbonate therapy. Both diltiazem hydrochloride and lithium carbonate have calcium antagonist effects in the central nervous system, and we review their mechanisms of action. A possible synergistic drug interaction between diltiazem and lithium is reported. \nEffects of 30-h sleep loss on cardiorespiratory functions at rest and in exercise. The effects of 30-h sleep deprivation on cardiorespiratory function either at rest or in exercise were studied in 15 young healthy male volunteers. All subjects performed 1-min incremental exercise tests on a bicycle ergometer until exhaustion and endurance exercise tests at 3/4 of their maximal work rates. Arterialized venous blood samples were withdrawn at rest and during exercise tests to investigate the influence of sleep loss on blood gases. In addition, resting plasma catecholamine levels were also measured in ten subjects. The results showed that 1) resting heart rate, plasma catecholamine levels, and blood pH were decreased while minute ventilation (VI) and CO2 production (VCO2) were increased after 30 h of sleep loss (P less than 0.05), and 2) the maximal exercise performance was reduced by sleeplessness, as indicated by the decreases in the maximal heart rate, peak VI, peak VCO2, peak O2 consumption, and time to exhaustion (P less than 0.05). However, no significant changes in exercise endurance, arterialized venous pH, and PCO2 were found in exercise after sleep deprivation either. We therefore conclude that 30-h sleep loss alters cardiorespiratory function at rest and the ability to perform maximal exercise but not exercise endurance. \nAutoantigen recognition by thyroid-infiltrating T cells in Graves disease. Graves disease is a common form of human autoimmune thyroiditis. It shares many pathological features and HLA associations with other, less easily studied, organ-specific autoimmune conditions such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and hence it is also a useful model for understanding these other diseases. We have previously shown that thyroid-infiltrating T cells in Graves disease that have been recently activated in vivo specifically recognize autologous thyroid epithelial cells. However, the autoantigens involved were not defined. In this study, we have made use of antigen-independent T-cell cloning techniques to show that at least three different thyroid antigens, three different epitopes on a single antigen, and two HLA class II elements are involved in this recognition process in a single individual. This demonstrates that T cells that are present and activated at the site of a human autoimmune disease may show considerable heterogeneity in their recognition of autoantigen on the target tissue. This contrasts with the limited heterogeneity recently reported in some animal models and has potentially important implications for both our understanding of the autoimmune process in humans and the design of immunotherapies to reverse it. \nSolitary expression of CD7 among T-cell antigens in acute myeloid leukemia: identification of a group of patients with similar T-cell receptor beta and delta rearrangements and course of disease suggestive of poor prognosis. In a series of 100 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients defined by cytochemistry and immunophenotyping, 20 expressed T-lymphocyte associated antigens on the surface of their blasts. While 15 expressed two or more T-cell antigens, five were found to express only CD7. All patients belonged to the French-American-British type M4, and four were under the age of 40. Despite intensive chemotherapy, four never obtained a complete remission and the fifth died of relapse after an allogenic bone marrow transplantation. While 12 randomly selected T-cell antigen negative AML patients showed only few rearrangements in Ig- or T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, such genetic alterations were demonstrated in four of five patients for the TCR delta gene and in all patients for the TCR beta gene. Interestingly, DNA fragments of similar size were demonstrated in three of five patients for both the beta and delta genes. These data suggest that the solitary presence of CD7 among T-cell antigens in otherwise clearcut AML cases identifies a group of patients with similarities in antigen receptor gene configuration as well as outcome. \nSmoking-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost--United States, 1988. Smoking is a leading cause of diseases associated with premature mortality in the United States; in 1985, these diseases accounted for an estimated 390,000 premature deaths. In this report, mortality data and estimates of smoking prevalence for 1988 are used to calculate smoking-attributable mortality (SAM), years of potential life lost (YPLL), and age-adjusted SAM and YPLL rates for the United States. Calculations were performed using Smoking-Attributable Mortality, Morbidity, and Economic Cost (SAMMEC II) software, which includes relative risk estimates for 22 adult (i.e., greater than or equal to 35 years of age) smoking-related diseases and relative risk estimates for four perinatal (i.e., less than 1 year of age) conditions. Age-, sex-, and race-specific mortality data for 1988 were obtained from CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Data on burn deaths caused by cigarettes were obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The estimated number of deaths among nonsmokers from lung cancer attributable to passive smoking was obtained from a report of the National Academy of Sciences. Age-, sex-, and race-specific current and former smoking prevalence rates in 1988 for adults aged greater than or equal to 35 years and for women aged 18-44 years were estimated by linear extrapolation using National Health Interview Survey data for 1974-1987. \nTumor necrosis factor receptors in lymphoid tissues and lymphomas. Source and site of action of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), which is produced by germinal center dendritic reticulum cells (DRC) in lymphoid tissue, plays a regulatory role in a local immune response. However no information is available on the nature and location of cells responding to this cytokine. Thus TNF receptor distribution was investigated in situ by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies directed against the p75 and p55 receptor proteins. Receptor expression was unique and restricted to the lymphoreticular tissue. The p75 receptor was found on activated lymphocytes and interdigitating reticulum cells of the T-cell area, whereas the p55 receptor was confined to the germinal center DRCs, which are the main site of TNF alpha production. The two receptor proteins were expressed on distinct cell populations of the lymphoid system and no coexpression was observed. Preliminary results indicate that TNF receptor (TNFR) expression is regulated; Upregulation of TNFR proteins was found in reactive hyperplasia together with increased TNF alpha expression. In lymphoproliferative disorders, expression of the p75 receptor and TNF alpha was found mainly in high-grade malignant non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In summary, TNF alpha produced by germinal center DRCs might regulate an in vivo immune response through autocrine and paracrine pathways. Thus TNF alpha might signal, through the distinct TNFR proteins, the p55 and p75 receptor, which are expressed on different cell types in lymphoid tissue. \nDiagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct: usefulness of lymphangiography and CT. The usefulness of lymphangiography and CT in the diagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct was evaluated in 12 patients with chylothorax or chylous ascites after surgery. Bipedal lymphangiography was performed in all 12 patients. The last four patients studied also had CT after lymphangiography. Seven patients had abnormal findings on lymphangiograms; five with leaks from the thoracic duct, one with a lymphocele in a nephrectomy bed, and one with obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels after thoracotomy. Five patients had no evidence of lymphatic leakage. CT in one patient with evidence of a leak on lymphangiography showed extravasation of contrast medium into the mediastinum and pleural space. CT in three patients with no abnormalities on lymphangiography also showed no abnormalities. Four of the five thoracic duct lacerations and the lymphocele were confirmed surgically. The diagnosis of obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels was supported clinically. Four of the five patients with normal findings on lymphangiograms had resolution of their pleural effusions and no evidence of recurrence during a follow-up period of 1-27 months. One patient with normal findings on lymphangiography had an alternative diagnosis established at surgery. Laceration of the thoracic duct was accurately diagnosed and localized with lymphangiography, which allowed definitive surgical repair. CT was of little additional value in diagnosing these injuries. \nBilateral diaphragm paralysis after cardiac surgery with topical hypothermia. Bilateral diaphragm paralysis is a rare but important complication of open heart surgery. Two cases were found among 360 prospectively studied patients undergoing open heart surgery during one year. Both patients had insulin dependent diabetes with peripheral neuropathy and this may have contributed to their diaphragm paralysis. The patients were studied postoperatively for one year with measurements of lung function, nocturnal oximetry, diaphragmatic function, and phrenic nerve conduction. Treatment with intermittent positive airway pressure ventilation by nasal mask was effective in both patients. After nine months one patient had recovered completely with normal phrenic nerve conduction and diaphragmatic function; the other continues most of his normal daytime activities, but still requires nasal positive airway pressure ventilation for six hours at night. \nPhysiological and anatomical evidence for a magnocellular defect in developmental dyslexia. Several behavioral studies have shown that developmental dyslexics do poorly in tests requiring rapid visual processing. In primates fast, low-contrast visual information is carried by the magnocellular subdivision of the visual pathway, and slow, high-contrast information is carried by the parvocellular division. In this study, we found that dyslexic subjects showed diminished visually evoked potentials to rapid, low-contrast stimuli but normal responses to slow or high-contrast stimuli. The abnormalities in the dyslexic subjects' evoked potentials were consistent with a defect in the magnocellular pathway at the level of visual area 1 or earlier. We then compared the lateral geniculate nuclei from five dyslexic brains to five control brains and found abnormalities in the magnocellular, but not the parvocellular, layers. Studies using auditory and somatosensory tests have shown that dyslexics do poorly in these modalities only when the tests require rapid discriminations. We therefore hypothesize that many cortical systems are similarly divided into a fast and a slow subdivision and that dyslexia specifically affects the fast subdivisions. \nHigh expression of the DNA methyltransferase gene characterizes human neoplastic cells and progression stages of colon cancer. DNA methylation abnormalities occur consistently in human neoplasia including widespread hypomethylation and more recently recognized local increases in DNA methylation that hold potential for gene inactivation events. To study this imbalance further, we have cloned and localized to chromosome 19 a portion of the human DNA methyltransferase gene that codes for the enzyme catalyzing DNA methylation. Expression of this gene is low in normal human cells, significantly increased (30- to 50-fold by PCR analysis) in virally transformed cells, and strikingly elevated in human cancer cells (several hundredfold). In comparison to colon mucosa from patients without neoplasia, median levels of DNA methyltransferase transcripts are 15-fold increased in histologically normal mucosa from patients with cancers or the benign polyps that can precede cancers, 60-fold increased in the premalignant polyps, and greater than 200-fold increased in the cancers. Thus, increases in DNA methyltransferase gene expression precede development of colonic neoplasia and continue during progression of colonic neoplasms. These increases may play a role in the genetic instability of cancer and mark early events in cell transformation. \nArachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are increased in human colorectal cancer. Increased arachidonic acid concentrations in experimental rodent colonic cancer have been described recently. In humans, a reduced erythrocyte stearic acid to oleic acid ratio has been reported in patients with colorectal cancer and it has been proposed that similar changes exist in the cancer tissue. The long chain fatty acids in the cancers of 15 patients with colorectal cancer were measured and compared with values in the unaffected mucosa. The values were expressed as mean (SD) mg fatty acid/g tissue and compared by analysis of variance. In the cancer tissue arachidonic acid was increased (0.703 (0.109) mg/g v 0.603 (0.127) mg/g, p less than 0.05) as was docosahexaenoic acid (0.211 (0.066) mg/g v 0.148 (0.039) mg/g, p less than 0.001). In contrast, the stearic acid to oleic acid ratio in the cancer tissue was increased rather than decreased, as previously suggested (0.36 (0.05) v 0.29 (0.7), p less than 0.01). Increased arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations may be related to reduced lipid peroxidation, which is a feature of rapidly growing cells. Alternatively, the increased arachidonic acid values could be due to enhanced desaturase activity upon linoleic and linolenic acid, leading perhaps to increased formation of prostaglandins and other lipoxygenase products. \nbcl-1 rearrangement. Frequency and clinical significance among B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The authors investigated the structural organization of the bcl-1 locus, a putative oncogene associated with reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(11;14), by Southern blot hybridization analysis and its frequency, distribution, and prognostic significance in a panel of 156 clinically and pathologically well-defined B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). The authors detected bcl-1 rearrangements in only 2 of 42 CLLs and 4 of 114 NHLs, specifically 3 of 29 diffuse small lymphocytic and 1 of 10 diffuse small cleaved cell and none of 5 diffuse intermediate lymphocytic, 13 follicular predominantly small cleaved, 17 follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell, 4 diffuse mixed small and large cell, 26 diffuse large cell, and 10 diffuse small noncleaved cell lymphomas. None of seven cases of Rai stage III or IV CLL or seven diffuse large cell lymphomas occurring as Richter's syndrome exhibited bcl-1 rearrangements. In conclusion, the bcl-1 locus rearranges in only about 4% of B-cell CLLs and NHLs, is predominantly rearranged in low-grade B-cell neoplasms, and does not appear to be preferentially associated with those occasional CLLs and low-grade NHLs displaying clinical aggressiveness, advanced clinical stage, or large cell transformation (Richter's syndrome). Therefore the demonstration of bcl-1 rearrangement does not appear to have clinically useful prognostic significance. \nLong-term spinal administration of morphine in cancer and non-cancer pain: a retrospective study. Records of 313 patients who had been treated with spinal morphine via an implanted Port-A-Cath were reviewed. In 284 cases the Port-A-Cath was implanted for epidural delivery of morphine in patients with cancer-related pain. These patients were treated for a mean of 96 (range 1-1215) days. There was a wide variation in dose requirements, minimum daily dose ranging from 0.5 to 200 mg and maximum daily dose from 1 to 3072 mg. However, there was no clear trend to increasing dose as period of epidural morphine administration increased. The most frequent complications were pain on injection (12.0% incidence), occlusion of the portal system (10.9%), infection (8.1%) and leakage of administered morphine such that it did not all reach the epidural space (2.1%). In all but 1 case infections were limited to the area around the portal or along the catheter track. All infections resolved without sequelae following removal of the portal and/or administration of antibiotics. In 17 patients Port-A-Caths were implanted for the intrathecal delivery of morphine to control cancer-related pain. These patients also exhibited wide variations in morphine dose requirements. Port-A-Caths were also implanted for delivery of spinal morphine in 12 patients with chronic pain which was not related to cancer and which failed to respond to other therapies. These patients were treated for a mean of 155 (range 2-575) days. Port-A-Caths were removed from 7 of these patients, primarily due to infection (2 cases) and inadequate pain relief and pain on injection (2 cases). \nNaloxone reverses pattern of obstruction of the distal common bile duct induced by analgesic narcotics in hepatobiliary imaging. It is widely known that narcotics, such as morphine, cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, increasing pressure in the common bile duct. This pharmacologic effect has been applied to hepatobiliary scintigraphy in patients with chronic cholecystitis or cholestasis to reducing the time required for a diagnostic study. However, this feature of narcotics could result in delayed or nonvisualization of the small bowel, simulating a distal common bile duct obstruction, in patients requiring parenteral narcotic analgesics who must undergo hepatobiliary scintigraphy. We report on three patients where administration of intravenous naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan), a narcotic antagonist, was helpful in distinguishing narcotic-induced spasm of the sphincter of Oddi from true obstruction of the common bile duct. \nIntrarectal sonography. A new technique for the assessment of rectal tumors. Preoperative staging of rectal tumors provides a selective therapeutic approach. Twenty-three patients were evaluated with prospective intrarectal sonography. Endosonography identified all 21 rectal lesions. Two patients with previous rectal carcinoma had no evidence of recurrence. Thirteen of 17 patients (76%) with rectal carcinoma were correctly staged by endosonography. A submucosal leiomyosarcoma and pararectal arachnoid cyst were correctly identified. Preoperative assessment of lymph node status was accurate in five of ten patients (50%). Results of preoperative digital rectal examination predicting rectal wall involvement correlated with pathologic findings in 11 of 15 patients (73%). Intrarectal sonography is an important staging technique for preoperative evaluation of rectal wall invasion and guides appropriate surgical intervention. \nAnatomic consideration for sacral screw placement. Instrumentation of the lumbosacral spine increasingly involves screw fixation to the sacrum. Recommended locations and techniques for screw placement vary, particularly when bicortical purchase of the sacrum is performed. The purpose of this study was to describe the critical anatomy and potential injuries to neurovascular and visceral structures anterior to the sacrum. Lack of awareness can lead to life-threatening complications. The study included 22 fresh human cadavers with no prior spinal surgery. Specimens were placed in a prone position, and the lumbosacral spine was exposed. Two 6.5-mm screws were inserted using one of two techniques, respectively: Starting just inferior to the S1 facet one screw was angled 25 degrees caudally and 30 degrees laterally; in the second technique, lateral inclination was increased to 45 degrees. In addition, all specimens had screws placed in the S2 pedicles. An anterior dissection was performed to allow evaluation of the neurovascular and visceral structures at risk for injury by, or adjacent to, the screw tips. All significant neurovascular structures in the area of concern were constant in position. The internal iliac vein and the lumbosacral nerve trunk were most at risk for injury by the 30 and 45 degrees laterally directed screws. The sigmoid colon, though close to the S2 screw, was protected by its mesentery. Screws placed in the S1 pedicle were least likely to injure the neurovascular bundle. A lateral and a midline safe zone were identified. \nPlasma sodium-potassium ATPase inhibition activity in low- and normal-renin hypertension. Thirty-seven subjects with low- and normal-renin hypertension (plasma renin activity less than 0.45 ng/L/sec on a 100 mmol Na diet) were studied on a 10 and 100 mmol sodium diet (100 mmol K and 25 mmol Ca) to examine the effect of varied sodium intake on plasma Na,K-ATPase inhibitory activity (NKAIA) (% inhibition). On the 10 mmol Na diet, plasma NKAIA correlated with mean arterial pressure (MAP) (r = 0.384, P = .019). On the 100 mmol Na diet, plasma NKAIA correlated with daily urinary sodium excretion (r = 0.384, P = .019). With the increase in sodium intake, the mean change in MAP was 0.5 +/- 7.8 mm Hg (range -12.7 to 16.3) and the mean change in plasma NKAIA was -4.2 +/- 11.2% inhibition (range -37.5 to 16). The change in MAP was correlated to the change in plasma NKAIA (r = 0.384, P = .019). Plasma NKAIA is related to mean arterial pressure or urinary sodium excretion depending on the dietary sodium intake, and is related to sodium-induced changes in MAP in low and normal renin hypertensive patients. \nPrevention of stroke by antihypertensive drug treatment in older persons with isolated systolic hypertension. Final results of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). SHEP Cooperative Research Group OBJECTIVE.--To assess the ability of antihypertensive drug treatment to reduce the risk of nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke in isolated systolic hypertension. DESIGN.--Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. SETTING.--Community-based ambulatory population in tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS.--4736 persons (1.06%) from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57% were women, and 14% were black. INTERVENTIONS.--Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Primary.--Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary.--Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures. RESULTS.--Average follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87. CONCLUSION.--In persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000. \nAtaxic hemiparesis associated with ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome caused by a paracentral gyrus lesion. The authors report a case of ataxic hemiparesis and an ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome in relation to a glioblastoma of the paracentral gyrus region. The physiopathology of this clinical presentation caused by compression of the corticopontine tract is discussed. \nEarly angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by hypotension. Emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed in 62 patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by hypotension. All patients were treated within 12 hours of the onset of chest pain. Angioplasty was completely successful (residual lesion less than or equal to 50%) in 48 patients, partially successful (patent vessel greater than 50% residual lesion) in four patients, and unsuccessful in 10 patients. Patients in whom angioplasty was successful had a hospital mortality rate of 19%; those in whom angioplasty was unsuccessful or only partially successful had hospital mortality rates of 60% and 50%, respectively, (p = 0.012). Patients with occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending vessel had the highest failure rate (42%) and the highest mortality rate (67%). Other univariate predictors of hospital mortality were older age and elevated end-diastolic pressure. Successful emergency angioplasty improves mortality in patients with acute infarction complicated by hypotension. \nProtection by 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 and dibutyryl cyclic AMP against complement-mediated hepatic necrosis in rats. 16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2, a known cytoprotective agent, was examined for its ability to protect the liver against complement-mediated necrosis induced by an intravenous injection of a monoclonal antibody against a rat liver-specific antigen in rats. The hepatic injury induced by the antibody was characterized by (a) rapid development of numerous massive hemorrhagic foci of necrotic liver cells, (b) marked increases in serum liver enzyme activities and (c) pronounced reduction in the CH50 level, presumably as a result of complement consumption in the liver. Pretreatment with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 at intraperitoneal doses of 20 and 100 micrograms/kg suppressed the hepatic injury, as evidenced by markedly mitigated liver-cell necrosis and much smaller increases in the serum-enzyme activities compared with the values in diseased control animals. The prostaglandin analogue failed to prevent serum complement consumption in response to the antibody injection or affect the CH50 level at the preinjury stage, indicating that neither complement inactivation nor interference with the antigen-antibody reaction was involved in the hepatic protection. The hepatoprotective doses of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 produced a significant increase in liver cyclic AMP content in a dose-related manner. In addition, intravenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP at 3 and 10 mg/kg dose-dependently prevented histological and biochemical changes in the hepatic damage without altering the rate of reduction in serum complement activity. Like 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not affect the preinjury CH50 level. \nIron chelation therapy and lung transplantation. Effects of deferoxamine on lung preservation in canine single lung transplantation. Reperfusion injury is a limiting factor in lung transplantation. Deferoxamine is an iron chelator that inhibits the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals. We investigated the effects of deferoxamine on posttransplantation lung function in a canine model of single lung transplantation. Twelve dogs underwent left lung transplantation after 20- to 24-hour hypothermic storage in a modified Euro-Collins solution. In six experiments donor and recipient received a 10 mg/kg dose of deferoxamine before harvest and transplantation, and 10 mg/kg was added to the preservation solution. Arterial oxygen tension, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, pulmonary vascular resistance, and dynamic lung compliance were measured. Data were recorded for 6 hours after ligation of the native pulmonary artery. At the end of the study the mean arterial oxygen tension was 175.1 mm Hg for the deferoxamine treated group versus 71.1 mm Hg for the control group (p less than 0.001), and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference was less in the deferoxamine-treated group: 502.3 versus 606.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The mean pulmonary vascular resistance was lower throughout the study, and after 6 hours it was 455.1 dynes/sec/cm(-5) in the deferoxamine-treated group versus 663.7 dynes/sec/cm(-5) in the control group (p less than 0.035). Compliance was similar in both groups. We conclude that deferoxamine improves lung preservation and early posttransplantation function in canine single lung transplantation. \nComparative efficacy and safety of bepridil and diltiazem in chronic stable angina pectoris refractory to diltiazem. The Bepridil Collaborative Study Group. The efficacy and safety of bepridil hydrochloride (200 to 400 mg/day) were evaluated in patients with chronic stable angina refractory to maximal tolerated doses of diltiazem (median 360 mg/day) in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel study. Baseline diltiazem data were obtained during a 2-week period, after which 86 patients were randomized to bepridil (n = 46) or diltiazem (n = 40). Angina frequency, nitroglycerin consumption and ischemic manifestations induced by exercise treadmill testing were evaluated over 8 weeks. Bepridil significantly (p less than 0.05) increased time to angina onset, time to 1 and 2 mm of ST-segment depression, total exercise time and total work over baseline values. Changes in time to angina onset and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression were significantly (p less than 0.05) greater for bepridil than for diltiazem. Angina frequency and nitroglycerin consumption did not differ significantly between groups. Compared with baseline, bepridil significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased heart rate (mean 4 beats/min) and prolonged QTc (mean 35 ms). The most frequent adverse effects in both groups were nausea, asthenia, dizziness, headache and diarrhea. Four patients taking bepridil and 1 taking diltiazem withdrew from the study because of adverse reactions. No sudden deaths, myocardial infarctions or instances of sustained ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes occurred in either group. The data indicate that bepridil provided safe and effective antianginal and antiischemic therapy in patients with chronic stable angina who exhibited less than optimal response to maximal tolerated doses of diltiazem. \nCombined vitrectomy, cataract extraction, and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in diabetic patients. Combined extracapsular cataract extraction, pars plana vitrectomy, and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed in six eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These eyes all had minimal iris vascular changes and were at reasonably low risk for developing intraoperative and postoperative complications. The surgery must be relatively brief and the endophotocoagulation accurate. Initial visual acuities ranged from light perception to 4/200. With an average follow-up of 9.7 months, final acuities ranged from 4/200 to 20/40. \nInefficacy and proarrhythmic effects of flecainide and encainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of encainide and flecainide in treating patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: Patients were treated with encainide or flecainide. Efficacy was assessed by comparing the results of programmed ventricular stimulation while patients received therapy with the results while they were drug free. SETTING: The electrophysiology laboratory of the University of California at San Francisco. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients with spontaneous or inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation for whom treatment with at least one class IA antiarrhythmic agent had failed. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with encainide, 35 to 50 mg three or four times daily, or flecainide, 100 to 200 mg twice daily. RESULTS: Arrhythmia worsened early in 5 of 16 patients receiving encainide and 3 of 33 patients receiving flecainide. Patients with poor left ventricular function were more likely to exhibit proarrhythmia (P = 0.02). Nine of eleven patients receiving encainide and 23 of 28 patients receiving flecainide who had repeat programmed ventricular stimulation while receiving drug therapy still had inducible, poorly tolerated ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: Encainide and flecainide have a low efficacy rate and a high incidence of worsening of arrhythmia in patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias, particularly when this condition is associated with poor left ventricular function. \nSerial angiography in a spontaneous dissecting anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. Intracranial dissecting aneurysms are uncommon, and little is known concerning the natural history of these lesions. In this paper we present a rare case of dissecting aneurysm of the anterior cerebral artery in which a true diagnostic sign of \"double lumen\" was demonstrated. Sequential changes in angiographic features shown on serial angiographic studies are described, and diagnosis is briefly discussed. \nPathogenesis of severe acute respiratory infections in the developing world: respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are the most frequently isolated pathogens in infants and children with acute lower respiratory infection (LRI) in the developed world. Less information is available about their importance in LRI in the developing world, but they are probably important there also. The pathogenesis of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia involves inoculation and early replication in the upper respiratory tract, followed by aspiration into the lower respiratory tract when both the mucosal and systemic immune systems are involved in a specific response. Both disease and recovery reflect processes of viral replication (with attendant cellular destruction) and of immune response (with attendant direct cellular destruction and release of pathogenic, along with beneficial, mediators). Factors predisposing to bacterial superinfection are poorly understood except in animal models. Conditions leading to heightened susceptibility to severe disease in the developed world are particularly common in the developing world. Increasing information on RSV and PIV infections in the developing world will likely point to their importance. Strategies for prevention of severe illnesses due to these viruses will follow from concepts elucidated through animal models and studies of infants in the developed world. \nMagnetic resonance imaging in the staging of renal cell carcinoma. A prospective study has been carried out to examine the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the investigation of renal cell carcinoma in 24 patients. In all cases the inferior vena cava (IVC) was well demonstrated with MRI. In 14 out of 15 patients where surgical correlation was available, the MRI and operative staging were in agreement. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic (CT) staging were in agreement in 16 out of the 17 patients where both were performed. In one case, CT suggested hepatic invasion but this was found not to be present on MRI and at operation. Magnetic resonance imaging also provided substantial additional information in three patients, including two cases where MRI demonstrated a patent IVC that appeared occluded on CT (one of which also had vertebral metastases seen on MRI but missed on CT) and one case where CT failed to demonstrate minimal involvement of the IVC. Magnetic resonance imaging is an accurate means of staging renal cell carcinoma with clear advantages over CT. In no case in this series was inferior vena cavography found to be necessary. \nMonitoring of irrigating fluid absorption during transurethral prostatectomy. A study in anaesthetised patients using a 1% ethanol tag solution. A simple, reliable method to detect absorption of irrigating fluid during transurethral prostatectomy is to tag irrigating fluids with 1% ethanol and monitor expired breath ethanol concentrations. This method correlated well (n = 0.79) with other existing methods of absorption monitoring in 20 anaesthetised patients. Ethanol (1%) tagging does not alter the optical quality of the irrigating fluid and is harmless to the patient. The technique is non-invasive, repeatable, cheap and gives instant results. It can be used in anaesthetised or awake patients and can detect absorption of as little as 100-150 ml in any 10-minute period. \nCholelithiasis after treatment for childhood cancer. The authors evaluated the risk of development of cholelithiasis in 6050 patients treated at a single hospital for various childhood cancers with different therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation, from 1963 to 1989. Patients with underlying chronic hemolytic anemia or preexisting gallstones were excluded. Nine female and seven male patients with a median age of 12.4 years (range, 1.2 to 22.8 years) at diagnosis of primary cancer had gallstones develop 3 months to 17.3 years (median, 3.1 years) after therapy was initiated. Cumulative risks of 0.42% at 10 years and 1.03% at 18 years after diagnosis substantially exceed those reported for the general population of this age group. Treatment-related factors significantly associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis were ileal conduit, parenteral nutrition, abdominal surgery, and abdominal radiation therapy (relative risks and 95% confidence intervals = 61.6 [27.9-135.9], 23.0 [9.8-54.1], 15.1 [7.1-32.2], and 7.4 [3.2-17.0], respectively). There was no correlation with the type of cancer, nor was the frequency of conventional predisposing features (e.g., family history, obesity, use of oral contraceptives, and pregnancy) any higher among the affected patients in this study than in the general population. Patients with cancer who have risk factors identified here should be monitored for the development of gallstones. \nLong-term effect of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction. To assess the long-term effect of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular (LV) systolic function, 222 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4 hours of symptom onset underwent assessment of LV ejection fraction (EF) by radionuclide equilibrium angiography at hospital discharge and 1 year later. Mean EF at hospital discharge (46 +/- 12) was similar to that at 1 year (45 +/- 13). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis identified EF at discharge and patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge as independent predictors of EF change at 1 year (p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively). Random assignments to invasive versus conservative treatment strategies or to early versus delayed beta-blocker therapy did not affect EF change during follow-up. No significant deterioration of EF was observed in patients with larger infarcts. However, EF decreased from 45 +/- 10 at hospital discharge to 39 +/- 12 (p = 0.005) at 1-year follow-up in a subgroup of patients with history of prior infarction. Thus, patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator early after onset of symptoms, appear to have stable LV function between hospital discharge and 1 year follow-up. The change in EF between hospital discharge and 1 year can be predicted from the EF value at discharge, patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge and history of previous myocardial infarction. \nEffect of insulin and plasma amino acid concentration on leucine metabolism in cirrhosis. Clinically stable patients with cirrhosis demonstrate insulin resistance with regard to glucose metabolism. However, much less is known about the two major factors, insulin and plasma amino acid concentration, that regulate protein metabolism in cirrhotic patients. To examine this question, we performed paired euglycemic insulin clamp studies in combination with 14C-leucine and indirect calorimetry. In the first study insulin alone was infused, and the plasma amino acid concentration was allowed to decline. During the second study a balanced amino acid solution was infused with insulin to increase the total plasma amino acid concentration approximately twofold. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal (4.68 vs. 6.45 mg/kg-min, p less than 0.01) was significantly impaired by 30% in cirrhotic patients during both insulin clamp studies. In the postabsorptive state, cirrhotic patients manifested low plasma leucine (76 vs. 102 mumol/L) and alpha-ketoisocaproate (19 vs. 30 mumol/L) concentrations, but all parameters of leucine turnover were normal. When insulin alone was infused, the endogenous leucine flux (an index of protein degradation) declined similarly in cirrhotic patients (30.8 mumol/m2-min) and control (26.9) subjects, and this was accompanied by a similar decrease in plasma leucine concentration (31% vs. 33%). The decline in circulating leucine concentration was accompanied by a parallel decline in leucine oxidation (5.1 vs. 4.6 mumol/m2-min) and nonoxidative (28.9 vs. 26.0 mumol/m2-min) leucine disposal, which were of similar magnitude in cirrhotic patients and control subjects, respectively. In both cirrhotic patients and control subjects, combined hyperinsulinemia/hyperaminoacidemia elicited a similar stimulation of nonoxidative leucine disposal (an index of protein synthesis) and leucine oxidation while causing a greater suppression of endogenous leucine flux than observed with insulin alone. Thus the suppressive effect of insulin on protein degradation and the stimulatory effect of insulin/amino acid infusion on protein synthesis are not impaired in cirrhotic patients, demonstrating a clear-cut dissociation between the effects of insulin on protein and glucose metabolism. \nNovel approach to iatrogenic bile peritonitis. Bile peritonitis after injury to the biliary tree is a serious complication that requires exploratory laparotomy. Our patient had an obstructing ampullary carcinoma, and generalized bile peritonitis developed from attempted percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. The patient's condition was managed by peritoneal lavage and endoscopic transampullary stenting, with immediate relief of pain and toxicity. Exploratory laparotomy was avoided, and an eventual pylorus-sparing Whipple resection was the definitive treatment. We believe this to be the first report of successful nonoperative treatment of a patient with bile peritonitis with obstructive jaundice. \nComparative efficacy of cimetidine, famotidine, ranitidine, and mylanta in postoperative stress ulcers. Gastric pH control and ulcer prevention in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. To determine the comparative efficacy of several histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists (cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine) and the antacid Mylanta-II (Stuart Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE) in gastric pH control and the prevention of postoperative stress ulceration, a prospective, randomized study was performed in a homogeneous population of patients with elective coronary artery bypass. None of the 57 patients in the study population had a documented history of ulcer disease. There were four treatment groups, each with similar demographics (age and sex). Cimetidine-treated group consisted of 15, famotidine-treated group of 18, ranitidine-treated group of 19, and antacid-treated group of 5 patients. There was no hemodynamically significant postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding in any of the patients. When the agents were compared for efficacy of gastric pH control, statistically better pH control was found in the famotidine- and ranitidine-treated groups (P less than 0.003) than in the cimetidine-treated group (pH less than or equal to 4.0) during the 20-hour observation period. Side effects (hematologic and neurological) were noted only in the cimetidine-treated group. The results of this study indicate that in patients in postoperative intensive care, better gastric pH control, and thus prevention of gastric stress ulcers, is achieved with either famotidine or ranitidine rather than cimetidine or antacid. \nAbnormal permeability precedes the development of a gluten sensitive enteropathy in Irish setter dogs. Intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA was examined during the development of gluten sensitive enteropathy in dogs bred from affected Irish setters and reared on a normal wheat containing diet. Comparisons were made with litter mates reared on a gluten free diet and with a control group of age matched, clinically healthy Irish setters reared on the normal diet. Studies at 4, 6, 8, and 12 months of age were correlated with morphometric and biochemical examinations of peroral jejunal biopsy specimens. Permeability was increased at all ages in the group fed gluten free diet compared with control dogs, although there were no differences in villus height, intraepithelial lymphocyte density, and alkaline phosphatase activity. At four months, permeability in the normal diet group was greater than in controls, although comparable with that in the gluten free diet group. Permeability in the normal diet group increased further in conjunction with the development of partial villus atrophy and reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, and by 12 months permeability was significantly greater than in their gluten free diet litter mates and the control dogs. The findings suggest that an underlying permeability abnormality may be involved in the pathogenesis of gluten sensitive enteropathy in Irish setter dogs. \nAcute inflammation: the underlying mechanism in delayed onset muscle soreness? It is well documented in animal and human research that unaccustomed eccentric muscle action of sufficient intensity and/or duration causes disruption of connective and/or contractile tissue. In humans, this appears to be associated with the sensation of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). During the late 1970's, it was proposed that this sensation of soreness might be associated with the acute inflammatory response. However, subsequent research failed to substantiate this theory. The present article suggests that the results of much of the research concerning DOMS reflect events typically seen in acute inflammation. Similarities between the two events include: the cardinal symptoms of pain, swelling, and loss of function; evidence of cellular infiltrates, especially the macrophage; biochemical markers such as increased lysosomal activity and increased circulating levels of some of the acute phase proteins; and histological changes during the initial 72 h. In the final section of this paper, a theoretical sequence of events is proposed, based on research involving acute inflammation and DOMS. \nalpha Fetoprotein producing early gastric cancer with liver metastasis: report of three cases. Three cases of alpha fetoprotein producing early gastric cancer are presented. Liver metastases occurred in all patients shortly after curative gastrectomy and all died within two years. The incidence of liver metastasis was significantly higher than that in alpha fetoprotein negative early gastric carcinoma (p less than 0.001). The incidences of lymph node metastasis and invasion in lymph vessels and veins were also substantially higher in this group of patients. Two radical hepatic resections, including extended right lobectomy, were performed on one patient but the tumour recurred immediately. \nAbnormal left ventricular diastolic filling in eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy of obesity. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling pattern of obese subjects with eccentric LV hypertrophy was studied. Findings were compared with those of normal control subjects and hypertensive patients with concentric LV hypertrophy. M-mode, 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiograms were recorded in 11 obese (body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2) normotensive patients with eccentric LV hypertrophy, 10 normal control subjects, and 18 nonobese, hypertensive patients with concentric LV hypertrophy whose antihypertensive medications were discontinued 2 weeks before study. LV hypertrophy was defined as LV mass/height greater than 143 g/m. Hypertrophy in the obese patients was eccentric: Their LV internal dimension (61 +/- 3 mm) was greater than that of hypertensive patients (55 +/- 5 mm, p less than 0.001) and normal control subjects (55 +/- 2 mm, p less than 0.01); their septal (10.7 +/- 0.7 mm) and posterior (10.9 +/- 0.6 mm) wall thicknesses were smaller than those of the hypertensive patients (12.2 +/- 1.7 mm, p less than 0.05 and 11.7 +/- 1.2 mm, respectively, difference not significant). Pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiographic filling indexes were used to evaluate LV diastolic filling. Obese patients had a higher peak velocity of atrial filling (69 +/- 14 vs 54 +/- 15 cm/s, p less than 0.05), lower early/atrial filling velocity ratio (1.0 +/- 0.26 vs 1.32 +/- 0.21, p less than 0.05), prolonged deceleration half-time (108 +/- 9 vs 86 +/- 15 ms, p less than 0.01) and lower peak filling rate corrected to stroke volume (4.08 +/- 0.68 vs 4.96 +/- 0.88 stroke volume/s, p less than 0.05) than normal control subjects. \nCoexistent hemangioblastoma and arteriovenous malformation of the cerebellum. Case report. A case of cerebellar hemangioblastoma and coexistent arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is presented. Angiography displayed the AVM, but histological examination revealed a coexisting hemangioblastoma. Various theories concerning the etiology of this condition are discussed. \nBranched-chain-enriched amino acid solutions in patients with liver failure: an early example of nutritional pharmacology. The use of BCAA in the treatment of hepatic failure has been controversial. Even in retrospect, it is difficult to know why this controversy existed and why it has been so emotional, except for the fact that such a treatment modality has flown in the face of conventional therapy of hepatic encephalopathy, and also, probably more importantly, directly attacked some of the cherished notions of the nature of hepatic encephalopathy. Time and distance have allowed some of the controversy to die down, and as time has elapsed it has become clear that at least in the area of nutritional support of patients with hepatic failure, BCAA are the preferred alternative to treat patients who are otherwise protein intolerant. A recent unbiased review using the techniques of meta-analysis has concluded that the BCAA are efficacious for the treatment of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Since this manuscript was completed another study has been reported. In this study, it was notable that those patients treated with oral BCAA became neurologically normal, a finding which the authors found very striking. \nEffect of epidural clonidine on analgesia and pharmacokinetics of epidural fentanyl in postoperative patients. Epidural clonidine produces postoperative analgesia in patients and potentiates opioid analgesia in animals. The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of epidural clonidine on the plasma concentrations and analgesic effect of fentanyl after epidural administration. Twenty ASA physical status 2 or 3 patients recovering from abdominal surgery were allocated randomly to receive either epidural fentanyl (100 micrograms in 10 ml isotonic saline; EF group) or epidural fentanyl (same dose) plus epidural clonidine (150 micrograms; EF + C group) in isotonic saline solution. Analgesia was assessed over a period of 12 h after epidural injection. Venous samples were obtained until 360 min after epidural injection for radioimmunoassay determination of plasma fentanyl concentration. Onset of analgesia was similar in the two groups of patients (13 +/- 6 and 13 +/- 3 min, respectively, after injection), but duration was more than doubled in the patients receiving clonidine (543 +/- 183 vs. 250 +/- 64 min). Peak plasma fentanyl concentrations (Fmax) and the time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were comparable in the two groups (0.29 +/- 0.15 ng.ml-1 at 16.2 +/- 14.8 min in the EF group and 0.27 +/- 0.11 ng.ml-1 at 8.3 +/- 5.5 min in the EF + C group), as were plasma concentrations at each definite time of measurement. Drowsiness and hypotension were noticed in the EF + C group. Thus, epidural clonidine appears to prolong epidural fentanyl analgesia without affecting its plasma concentration. \nTissue-specific activation of cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme in experimental heart failure. In addition to the circulating renin-angiotensin system, recent data demonstrate the existence of tissue renin-angiotensin systems that may be important in cardiovascular homeostasis. However, the relative activities of the circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin systems have not been examined previously in pathophysiological states, such as congestive heart failure. The present study was performed to examine the status of plasma and tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activities in compensated experimental heart failure induced by coronary artery ligation in the rat. Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were examined: 1) nonoperated rats (NO, n = 5), 2) sham-operated rats (SO, n = 5), and 3) heart failure rats (HF, n = 11). Rats were studied an averaged of 85 days postoperatively. In HF animals, plasma renin concentration and serum ACE activities were not different compared with NO and SO control animals. Cardiac ACE activity was 50% greater in the right ventricle than the interventricular septum in NO and SO rats. Both right ventricular and interventricular septal ACE activity increased approximately twofold in HF animals as compared with NO and SO groups (p less than 0.05). In contrast, pulmonary, aortic, and renal ACE activities were not altered in HF rats compared with control animals. A positive correlation existed between the histopathological size of myocardial infarction and the level of right ventricular ACE activity (r = 0.75, p less than or equal to 0.05). Such a relation between infarct size and either serum or noncardiac tissue ACE activities was not observed. \nSafety and possible efficacy of fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage in the management of refractory asthma with mucous impaction. Mucous impaction may be suspected in asthmatic exacerbation when, despite aggressive medical management, patients continue to produce sputum containing mucous plugs and exhibit prominent rhonchi and/or wheezes on chest auscultation. Spirometric measurements in this setting corroborate lack of improvement and reveal significant impairment in indices that may reflect small airways function (FEF25-75). We hypothesized that clearance of inspissated secretions by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage (FOBwL) may promote or hasten the clinical improvement of such patients. Fifty-one therapeutic FOBwL were accomplished in 19 patients during 20 episodes of stabilized yet refractory asthma with mucous impaction. No significant complications were encountered. After FOBwL, spirometric measurements of FEV1, FEF25-75, and FVC increased significantly (P less than .01, paired t test), and correlated with relief of dyspnea and mobilization of secretions with cough. FOBwL can be safely performed in stabilized, refractory asthma, and with apparent efficacy. Further investigation is needed to document the therapeutic utility of FOBwL in refractory asthma. \nUltrasonic evaluation of gallbladder function prior to non-surgical treatment of gallstones. A comparative analysis of ultrasonic and oral cholecystographic assessment of gallbladder function in symptomatic patients with cholelithiasis is presented. Ultrasonic evaluation demonstrated non-contractile gallbladders in all but one patient with non-opacification during oral cholecystography, whereas all those opacifying on oral cholecystography contracted on ultrasonography. Both techniques showed similar abilities to quantify the size and number of biliary calculi within the limits necessary to determine suitability for treatment. Although computed tomography remains necessary to quantify gallstone density prior to non-surgical treatment, ultrasonography is a safe, acceptable, cheap and preferable alternative to oral cholecystography in assessing gallbladder function. \nEmergence of a B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia: evidence for the single-cell origin of the two tumors. A patient is described who presented with a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and later developed a lymphoblastic lymphoma. The cells from the CLL were typical mature B lymphocytes as could be assessed by morphologic, cytochemical, and surface marker analyses. The cells from the lymphoblastic lymphoma were immature B cells that expressed CD10, CD20, and HLA-DR markers, but not surface Ig or cytoplasmic mu chains, and were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). The cells of two continuous cell lines, obtained from the bone marrow and the peripheral blood of the patient, had the same phenotype as the lymphoblastic lymphoma cells, did not contain the Epstein-Barr virus genome, and displayed malignant features in vitro, including the capacity to form colonies in agar. The two cell lines also shared identical chromosomal abnormalities, a finding which suggests that they derived from the same malignant cell already present in vivo. Such chromosomal abnormalities were not seen in the karyotype of the peripheral blood cells at the onset of the disease. Analysis of the Ig heavy chain genes using a DJ-specific probe showed the very same monoclonal rearrangement in the cells from the B-CLL, the lymphoblastic lymphoma and the two cell lines, thus demonstrating their common clonal origin. By contrast, a monoclonal rearrangement of the lambda chain gene locus was found in the B-CLL cells only, a finding consistent with their exclusive capacity to express surface IgM lambda. This patient represents a rare case in whom a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder with mature malignant cells transforms into a lymphoblastic lymphoma characterized by cells frozen at a very early maturational stage. The possible mechanisms leading to such transformation within the same cell clone are discussed. \nWildervanck or cervico-oculo-acoustic syndrome and MRI findings. In 1952, Wildervanck described the first case of what he styled the cervico-oculo-acoustic (COA) syndrome. This comprises Klippel Feil's (KF) anomaly (congenitally fused cervical vertebrae), congenital sensorineural deafness and Duane's retraction syndrome (deficient abduction with retraction on adduction). Since that original paper, there have been further reports describing this triad, either completely or incompletely. A further case of this syndrome is reported and the first report of MRI head scan findings in this condition is presented. In addition, the origin of mirror movements observed as part of the KF syndrome are discussed. \nHepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection mimicking metastatic cancer to the liver. A cholestatic syndrome caused by sclerosing cholangitis and papillary stenosis has been described in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection. The case of a 41-year-old homosexual man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and cholestasis is reported. A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram showed that the extrahepatic and right-sided intrahepatic ducts were normal. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver. Guided needle biopsies of several of these lesions showed severe confluent necrotizing pericholangitis with cytomegalovirus-infected cells. Numerous cryptosporidia were seen attached to biliary epithelium. The unique histopathologic and radiographic features of this case should be added to the spectrum of hepatobiliary manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \nMultiple miliary osteoma cutis. We describe the clinical, radiographic, histologic, and metabolic features of an unusual case of multiple miliary osteoma cutis in an otherwise healthy 57-year-old woman. Although the pathogenesis of this rarely reported entity is not fully understood, the novel application of a dynamic bone study revealed a high rate of internal bone remodeling within the lesion. This finding prompted a brief therapeutic trial of a diphosphonate, not previously reported in the treatment of this condition. \nA prospective study of respiratory failure after high-risk surgery on the thoracoabdominal aorta. From June 1960 to September 1990, 1414 patients underwent repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, of whom 112 (8%) had pulmonary complications requiring respiratory support with tracheostomy; subsequently 45 (40%) died in the hospital. We determined by stepwise logistic regression analysis, in a prospective study of high-risk type I and II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms repairs, the independent predictors of respiratory failure, defined as respiratory ventilation exceeding 48 hours after operation. In 98 patients studied, 38 (39%) were women, 60 (61%) were men, 54 (55%) had type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 34 (35%) had aortic dissection, 19 (19%) were nonsmokers, 40 (41%) exsmokers, and 39 (40%) active smokers. Before operation, 55 (56%) had chronic pulmonary disease with respiratory failure developing in 58% (p = 0.0005 versus no chronic pulmonary disease, 10/43, 23%), and of the 26 patients in the lower quarter of forced expiratory volume (1 sec) (FEV1 less than or equal to 1.45 L) respiratory failure developed in 61% (p = 0.035). In-hospital survival was 98% and 83% (p = 0.008), respectively, and cumulative survival at 6 months by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 96% and 80% (p = 0.004, log-rank test), respectively, for patients without respiratory failure (N = 56/98, 57%) and with respiratory failure (N = 42/98, 43%). On univariate analysis, the following were associated with respiratory failure (p less than 0.05): FEV1, FEV1% predicted, FVC, FEF25, FEF25% predicted, FEF25-75, FEF25-75% predicted, PaCO2 Pao2, symptoms, smoking history, chronic pulmonary disease, cryoprecipitate volume, postoperative neuromuscular deficit, cardiac complications, reoperation for bleeding, renal complication, stress ulceration, postoperative creatinine level, postoperative dialysis, and postoperative encephalopathy. The independent predictors of respiratory failure were (p less than 0.05): chronic pulmonary disease, smoking history, cardiac and renal complications. In patients with chronic pulmonary disease, the only independent predictor was FEF25 (p = 0.030). These observations may be of value in selecting patients for elective operation. \nPreventive therapy for malaria. The incidence of malaria in travelers returning to the United States has been increasing. Persons visiting areas where malaria is endemic should use insect repellent, wear clothing that covers the arms and legs, and remain in screened areas between dusk and dawn. Chemoprophylaxis for travelers consists of weekly doses of chloroquine; a new drug, mefloquine, should be used in the increasing number of countries where chloroquine-resistant malaria is found. Travelers to these areas should carry three tablets of pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, which should be taken for presumptive treatment of malaria at the onset of chills and fever. It is essential that chemoprophylaxis be continued for four to five weeks after departure from endemic areas. In travelers who develop symptoms of malaria after returning from an endemic area, it is imperative that treatment be started even if blood smears are negative. \nWohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander syndrome: serum creatine kinase and functional outcome. The medical records of 31 patients (19 male and 12 female) with clinical and electrophysiologic features of Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander syndrome were reviewed. The reported age at onset ranged from less than one year to 46 years, and the age at diagnosis ranged from three to 66 years. Proximal muscle weakness, especially of the lower extremities, and muscular atrophy were the predominant clinical features. Elevated serum creatine kinase levels were noted in four female and 12 male patients, and the degree of elevation was higher in the male patients (up to 32 times the upper limit of normal) than in the female patients. On initial evaluation, two patients were wheelchair-bound, whereas the others were ambulatory. On follow-up evaluation three to 32 years later (mean, 15.5 years), 11 patients used wheelchairs, although only three were wheelchair-bound. The disease followed a steady, slowly progressive course. The outcome of ambulatory status did not correlate with the initial creatine kinase determination. \nCharacterization of fibronectin attachment by a human transitional cell carcinoma line, T24. The ability of transitional cell carcinoma cells to adhere to and invade the extracellular matrix is important in invasion and metastasis. The glycoprotein fibronectin is associated with laminin and Type IV collagen in the bladder basement membrane. We characterized the interaction between T-24 cells, a cell line derived from an invasive transitional cell tumor, and fibronectin. The cells use the alpha 5 beta 1 heterodimeric integrin receptor complex to mediate adherence via the classical (RGDS) fibronectin binding site. The importance of the alpha 5 beta 1 receptor to T-24 function is unknown and under investigation. \nHuman papillomavirus types 16 and 18 in adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. Many reports have shown a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical squamous neoplasia. However, the association of HPV with cervical adenocarcinoma has been studied less extensively. The authors evaluated the presence of HPV-DNA in 106 patients with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix by in situ hybridization, using 35S-labeled probes for HPV 16 DNA and HPV 18 DNA. The overall prevalence of HPV-DNA was 18% (19 of 106). HPV 16 was present in 2 (2%) cases, HPV 18 was observed in 15 (14%) cases, and both HPV 16 and HPV 18 were found in 2 (2%) cases. There was a correlation between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor stage (P less than 0.01) and tumor size (P less than 0.05), but there was no relationship between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor differentiation, proliferation (S-phase fraction), ploidy, lymph node metastases, or five-year survival rate. These results suggest that HPV 18 DNA is associated with cervical adenocarcinoma but the presence of HPV 18 has no influence on overall survival. \nAcute health effects in a community after a release of hydrofluoric acid. Approximately 3,000 persons were evacuated from a Texas community after 24,036 kg (53,000 lb) of caustic hydrofluoric acid (HF) were released from a nearby petrochemical plant. Emergency room and hospital records of 939 persons who were seen at two area hospitals were reviewed. Most persons who presented at the emergency rooms were female (56%) or black (60%), and their mean age was 33.9 y. The most frequently reported symptoms were eye irritation (41.5%), burning throat (21%), headache (20.6%), and shortness of breath (19.4%). Physical examination results were normal for 49% of the cases; however, irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin, and lungs were noted on other exams. Decreased pulmonary function was demonstrated by pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in the first second, less than 80% of predicted value, 42.3%); hypoxemia (pO2 less than 80 mm Hg, 17.4%) and hypocalcemia (less than 8.5 mg/dl, 16.3%) were also noted. Ninety-four (10%) of the cases were hospitalized, and more than 83% of all cases were discharged with a primary diagnosis of \"HF exposure.\" There are several reports of individuals who are acutely and chronically exposed to HF; however, we are unaware of other published reports that describe exposure of a community to HF. This incident represented a unique opportunity to study the immediate health impact on a community of residents who were exposed to a hazardous materials release. Results of this analysis suggest that (a) initial health problems should be followed up, (b) any long-term health effects of HF exposure must be assessed, and (c) the health impact on the population at risk should be determined. \nNocturnal sleep in Huntington's disease. Nocturnal sleep was studied in 16 inpatients with Huntington's disease. In comparison with healthy controls, patients exhibited a disturbed sleep pattern with increased sleep onset latency, reduced sleep efficiency, frequent nocturnal awakenings, more time spent awake and less slow wave sleep. These abnormalities correlated in part with duration of illness, severity of clinical symptoms, and degree of atrophy of the caudate nucleus. Patients showed an increased density of sleep spindles. \nPersistent diarrhea and fecal shedding of retroviral nucleic acids in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Gastrointestinal dysfunction is a serious problem in many children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the etiology of which has not been clearly defined. Quantitative nucleic acid amplification was used to study the correlation between shedding of HIV nucleic acids and gastrointestinal symptoms in HIV-infected infants and children. Many with HIV infection and persistent diarrheal disease shed HIV nucleic acids in their feces, as did an HIV-infected patient without apparent diarrheal disease. HIV nucleic acids were not found in feces of non-HIV-infected individuals. Intestinal infection with HIV appears to be important in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal dysfunction in infants and children with HIV infection. Furthermore, the fecal shedding of HIV may play a role in HIV transmission in environments prone to high levels of fecal-oral contamination. \nEarly orthopedic intervention in burn patients with major fractures. Surgical treatment of concurrent orthopedic trauma in burn patients is controversial. During a 10-year period, 101 patients were treated for major fractures and burn injuries. Twenty-eight patients with 34 fractures were treated with early operative fixation. The mean TBSA burned was 20%. Ten fractures were open (4 grade I, 5 grade II, and 1 grade III) and 24 were closed. Seventy-five percent of patients had a definitive orthopedic procedure within 24 hours of burn. Intramedullary nails were used in 13, ORIF in 15, external fixation in 3, and percutaneous fixation in 4. Ten patients had burns overlying the fracture site and the surgical incision was made through burned tissue. Four were associated with open fractures. Two orthopedic complications occurred: nonunion of a femoral neck fracture and angulation of a tibial plateau fracture. The goal of orthopedic management in the polytrauma burn patient is to achieve early reduction to allow optimal wound care and early patient mobility. A team approach to patient selection and management is mandatory. \nDeletion of mitochondrial DNA in patients with combined features of Kearns-Sayre and MELAS syndromes. A 9-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy had ptosis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and sensorineural hearing loss. The girl had diabetes mellitus and the boy had hypoparathyroidism. Both children also developed recurrent vomiting and cerebral infarcts with lactic acidosis. Muscle biopsy specimens showed ragged-red fibers and Southern analysis demonstrated a distinct heteroplasmic deletion of muscle mitochondrial DNA in each patient but no evidence of the point mutation in the transfer RNALeu(UUR) gene recently identified in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). These 2 children had combined features of Kearns-Sayre syndrome and MELAS, suggesting that mitochondrial DNA deletions occasionally can have pleomorphic clinical expression. \nVerbal dyspraxia in treated galactosemia. Galactosemia is an inborn error of metabolism that causes life-threatening illness a few days after galactose-containing milk is fed to a newborn. Early treatment with a strict lactose-free diet results in rapid improvement, and, until recently, it was thought that the long-term prognosis in such infants was usually good. The speech characteristics of 24 patients treated for galactosemia were examined. Fifty-four percent had the specific speech disorder, verbal dyspraxia. This finding was not related to age at diagnosis, severity of symptoms in the newborn period, or to biochemical control. There may be, however, a relation between dyspraxia and diminished IQ scores observed in the group of patients with dyspraxia judged as \"severe.\" The findings indicate the association of a specific and unusual speech defect with a specific and rare metabolic disorder. \nEndoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal and colorectal malignancies. In a prospective study we compared the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology with that of brush cytology and forceps biopsy in relation to gross tumour pattern and site in 265 confirmed consecutive cases of malignancy of the oesophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum. Aspiration cytology gave the highest diagnostic accuracy (94%), which was significantly better than that of brush cytology (84.9%) and biopsy (87.2%) (p less than 0.005). The difference was mainly related to tumour pattern. When compared to brush cytology and biopsy aspiration cytology was significantly better in submucosal tumours (92.9% v 7.1% and 14.3%, p less than 0.001); in infiltrative malignancies (95.8% v 90.1% and 78.9%, p less than 0.01), and in ulceronecrotic malignancies (90.9% v 36.4% and 45.4%, p less than 0.05). In polypoid malignancies there was a significant trend (p less than 0.05) in favour of forceps biopsy, with a diagnostic yield of 100% compared with 95% for aspiration cytology and 93.3% for brush cytology. The accuracy of the different techniques was not significantly related to the site of the tumour. The cumulative accuracy of aspiration cytology and biopsy was significantly better than that of biopsy and brush cytology (98.5% v 90.9%, p less than 0.005). Aspiration cytology was diagnostic in 21 of 24 lesions that were negative with both brush cytology and biopsy. There were no false positive cytology or histology results. We conclude that aspiration cytology is a simple, safe, and reliable technique with a high diagnostic yield and is of particular value in submucosal, infiltrative, and ulceronecrotic tumours. \nVariation in intravaginal pressure measurements. The wide variation in intravaginal pressure measurements of the circumvaginal muscles (CVM) was studied in five subjects under well-controlled conditions. Previous research and clinical observations have indicated that fluctuations in the measurement of intravaginal pressure may be associated with time of day, day of testing, and existing stress factors. Subjects were assessed four times per day, on four consecutive days, for a total of 16 assessments. At each of the 16 conditions for a given subject, 10 CVM contractions lasting 12 seconds each were recorded and the variables, maximum pressure (MP10), peak maximum pressure (PMP), and abdominal pressure were analyzed. The within-subject variance was 15.5 (SD = 3.9); the between-subject variance was 132.4 (SD = 11.5). The effects of day, time, and stressor were analyzed by ANOVA specifically designed for variance estimates; no significant differences were found. The clinical observations that led to the study were not supported when systematically investigated. However, consistent data collection procedures appeared to reduce within-subject variance. \nPartial lamellar sclerouvectomy for ciliary body and choroidal tumors. The authors reviewed the postoperative course, visual results, histopathologic findings, and mortality data on 95 consecutive patients with tumors of the ciliary body and/or choroid who were managed by a partial lamellar sclerouvectomy. This surgical procedure is designed to remove the uveal tumor and leave intact the outer sclera and sensory retina. In this group of 95 patients, vitreous hemorrhage occurred in 79 (83%) cases, intraretinal or subretinal hemorrhage in 33 (35%), retinal detachment in 26 (28%), and cataract in 32 (34%). Most of the vitreous and retinal hemorrhages resolved spontaneously, sometimes leaving subretinal or preretinal fibrosis. A number of the postoperative retinal detachments resolved spontaneously, but retinal detachment surgery was necessary in 16 patients (17%), mostly in the earlier years of the survey. Most of the cataracts were mild and did not require surgery. The eventual postoperative visual acuity was equal to or better than the preoperative visual acuity in 23 cases (24%) over a mean follow-up period of 5 years. Enucleation was eventually necessary in 15 cases (16%), usually because of residual or recurrent tumor. Histopathologic diagnosis was uveal melanoma in 81 cases (85%) and other tumors in 14 cases (15%). There were no orbital recurrences, but distant metastases developed in five patients (5%), all of whom had undergone enucleation for recurrence of the intraocular melanoma. Although the surgical technique is difficult, partial lamellar sclerouvectomy appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option in selected cases of posterior uveal tumors. \nTelecanthal approach for meningiomas in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. In three cases involving meningiomas in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, transbasal spreading of the interocular distance (telecanthal approach) was used for tumor removal and reconstruction of the skull base. This telecanthal approach involves 1) bilateral en bloc removal of the superior lateral rim of the orbit, the nasal bone, and the posterior lateral wall of the orbit; 2) detachment of the medial canthal ligaments; and 3) spreading of the interocular distance. This approach provides a wide working space beneath the anterior half of the midline skull base, and needs neither a facial incision nor significant retraction of the brain. The surgical technique and its modification are described. The discussion focuses not only on comparisons with other techniques, but on the indications for this approach. Meningiomas originating in the paranasal sinuses are rare; a brief review of the literature concerning the clinicopathological features and pathogenesis is also given. \nNational outcomes of cataract extraction. Endophthalmitis following inpatient surgery. We analyzed the likelihood of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis in 338,141 Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 years who were admitted to US hospitals for cataract extraction in 1984. This cohort represents approximately one half of all persons who underwent cataract extraction under the Medicare program in 1984. Extracapsular extraction was performed in 195,587 (58%) of cases, intracapsular cataract extraction in 99,971 (30%), and phacoemulsification in 28,474 (8%). The risk of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis in the year following surgery was 0.17% for intracapsular cataract extraction compared with 0.12% for extracapsular extraction or phacoemulsification (P less than .002). The risk of endophthalmitis at 1 month was higher for intracapsular cataract extraction than for extracapsular extraction or phacoemulsification (0.11% vs 0.085%), although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Cataract surgery accompanied by anterior vitrectomy increased the 1-month risk of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis to 0.41%, more than a four-fold increase over that for cataract surgery alone (0.09%; P less than .05). The rates of endophthalmitis at 1 year were 0.58% and 0.13%, respectively, for cataract surgery with anterior vitrectomy and cataract surgery alone (P less than .0001). No significant differences in the rate of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis were observed based on the use of an intraocular lens, age, or race. Endophthalmitis within 1 year of surgery was 1.2 times more frequent in men than in women (0.16% vs 0.13%; P = .03). Overall, the likelihood of postoperative endophthalmitis from a national sample is consistent with case series previously reported. \nPlasma immunoreactive endothelin-1 in experimental malignant hypertension. We measured plasma concentrations of immunoreactive endothelin-1 (irET-1) in the prehypertensive and hypertensive phases in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in malignant hypertension caused by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt administration in SHR. We also measured concentrations of this peptide in another model of malignant hypertension, the two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) renovascular hypertensive rats chronically given caffeine. Plasma irET-1 concentrations in young (6-week-old) and mature (18-week-old) SHR did not differ from those of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Four weeks of treatment with DOCA-salt increased blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and plasma irET-1 in SHR but not in WKY rats. Eight weeks of DOCA-salt treatment further increased these values in SHR. Plasma irET-1 concentrations were not increased in the 2K1C rats. Six weeks of caffeine administration increased blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, plasma renin activity, and plasma irET-1 in the 2K1C rats but not in the sham-operated rats. High-performance liquid chromatographic profiles of plasma extracts pooled from these rats with malignant hypertension showed that a major component of irET-1 eluted in the position of synthetic ET-1 (1-21). Furthermore, acute hypertension induced by angiotensin II or phenylephrine did not affect the plasma irET-1 concentration in rats. The results suggested that the plasma ET-1 concentration is increased in rat models of malignant hypertension and that the high blood pressure itself is not the main factor involved in the increase of plasma ET-1. \nStage B adenocarcinoma of the prostate: transrectal US and pathologic correlation of nonmalignant hypoechoic peripheral zone lesions. Various benign conditions have been found to cause hypoechoic lesions in the prostate gland, thus mimicking the sonographic appearance of early prostatic cancer. Transrectal sonograms in a large series of patients with biopsy-proved clinical stage B prostatic cancer were retrospectively reviewed to determine the pathologic correlate to benign hypoechoic peripheral zone lesions. Transrectal sonograms demonstrated hypoechoic lesions that did not represent cancer in 25 of 160 patients examined. All lesions were contralateral to the carcinoma. Pathologic correlation was found in 24 of the 25 lesions. The results of this study show that contralateral hypoechoic lesions in patients with pathologically proved prostatic cancer do not necessarily imply bilateral tumor involvement; they accounted for benign lesions that mimicked the sonographic appearance of malignant tumors and thus produced a false-positive rate for cancer in the contralateral lobe of 16% of patients (25 of 160) with clinical stage B cancer. \nComparison of efficacy of automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients older and younger than 65 years of age. PURPOSE: The efficacy of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was compared in elderly patients and younger patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Clinical characteristics, surgical complications, and long-term survival rates were compared between the two age groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 54 elderly patients (greater than 65 years) and 79 younger patients (less than 65 years) who had had AICDs implanted for recurrent symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS: In 85% of elderly patients and 78% of younger patients, coronary artery disease was the underlying disease (NS). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 31.4 +/- 14.3% in the elderly patients and 35.7 +/- 17.6% in the younger patients (NS). Concomitant myocardial revascularization was performed in 37% of elderly patients and 29% of younger patients (NS); however, only 4% of elderly patients had concomitant left ventricular resection or cryoablation, compared with 15% of younger patients (p less than 0.001). Two patients in each age group died perioperatively (4% versus 3%, NS), and no significant difference in surgical morbidity or length of hospital stay following AICD implantation was noted between the age groups. In conjunction with AICD, elderly patients more commonly received antiarrhythmic drugs, with 54% of elderly patients taking amiodarone at the time of hospital discharge compared with 29% of the younger patients (p less than 0.008). In contrast, beta-blockers were more commonly used in younger patients (16% versus 2%, p less than 0.03). At a mean follow-up of 25 months, 11 (20%) elderly patients and 16 (20%) younger patients had died. Six deaths in elderly patients and five deaths in younger patients were classified as arrhythmic deaths (NS); however, only one younger patient and three elderly patients died suddenly (NS). Calculated survival curves demonstrated similar survival rates in the two age groups with approximately 90%, 87%, and 80% of the patients alive at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Theoretic survival curves calculated from appropriate AICD shocks demonstrated significantly lower survival compared with actual survival. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that AICD is a very effective treatment for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and this benefit applies to elderly patients as well as younger patients. \nHigh incidence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus in alcoholic cirrhosis: fact or fiction? An enzyme immunoassay (Ortho-HCV ELISA) for antibodies against the hepatitis C virus was used to test serum samples from 39 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and 34 patients with alcoholic hepatitis or fatty liver. The frequency of a positive result in the cirrhotics was significantly higher than in the alcoholics without cirrhosis (38.5% vs 8.8%, P less than 0.01). However, the positive results in the cirrhotics were associated with high gammaglobulin concentrations, and optical density values in the assay correlated closely with serum globulin (r = 0.73, P less than 0.01). The findings suggest that serum from patients with alcoholic cirrhosis may contain a component that give false-positive results in the assay. \nParaesophageal hernia causing colonic obstruction. In a paraesophageal hernia, the esophagogastric junction remains below the hiatus while portions of the fundus or other parts of the stomach herniate in front and to the left of the esophagogastric junction through the hiatus into the thorax. We describe an unusual presentation of a paraesophageal hernia, in which herniation of the splenic flexure of the colon led to colonic obstruction. \nPsychophysiological parameters of migraine and muscle-contraction headaches. Previous headache studies have been unable to verify the presumed presence of headache. Attempting to correct this design fault, the present study assessed four psychophysiological measures (frontalis EMG, temporal BVP, temporal and finger skin temperature) and salient subjective measures in 13 migraineurs, eight muscle-contraction headache sufferers, and 13 age-matched normals. All subjects submitted to two 30-minute sessions of quiet monitoring, and for the headache subjects, one of the sessions was headache active. A bogus, but convincing preliminary \"assessment\" revealed insufficient headache activity in the headache active session, forcing subjects to reschedule that session in the future when a strong headache was present. A parallel manipulation was employed with the normal subjects. A MANOVA failed to discriminate within- or between-group differences on the psychophysiological measures. Self-reported pain was uncorrelated with the psychophysiological indices. These results cast further doubt on the validity of the psychophysiological measures employed in this study, the same ones routinely endorsed by headache researchers and therapists. We discuss problems of recruitment, compliance, and attrition in basic headache research. \nEffects of dietary calcium on blood pressure, vascular reactivity and vascular smooth muscle calcium efflux rate in Zucker rats. Previous data from this laboratory indicate that hypertension in insulin resistant Zucker obese rats is accompanied by an impairment in vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ efflux. Since insulin resistant states are also generally salt-sensitive and dietary Ca2+ reduces blood pressure in some salt-sensitive states, we evaluated the effects of dietary Ca2+ on blood pressure and vascular reactivity and examined whether these effects are due to increased vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ efflux. We assigned 16 obese and 16 lean rats to a normal (0.5%) or high (1.5%) Ca2+ diet for 28 days, following which intraarterial blood pressure and in vitro vascular smooth muscle 45Ca efflux and vascular reactivity responses to phenylephrine and serotonin were measured. Blood pressure was elevated in the obese rats on both diets (P less than 0.2), and the high calcium diet lowered both systolic and diastolic pressure in both the lean and obese rats (P less than 0.5). Vascular reactivity was higher in the obese rats (P less than 0.2), but dietary Ca2+ exerted opposite effects on vascular reactivity to the agonists. High Ca2+ reduced sensitivity to serotonin in the obese rats by 54% (P less than .05) without affecting sensitivity in the lean rats. In contrast, the high Ca2+ diet increased sensitivity to phenylephrine by 31% in both groups (P less than .01). 45Ca efflux was lower in the obese rats compared to the lean rats (P less than .05), and the high Ca2+ diet increased this rate by 23% in the lean, but not the obese, rats (P less than .05). \nUsing anticoagulants safely.
