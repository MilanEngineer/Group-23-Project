Hypertension treatment in the 1990s will focus on the mechanisms by which blood pressure is lowered by various antihypertensive agents, as well as individualization of drug therapy based on coexisting diseases and conditions. Emphasis will be placed on use of monotherapy whenever possible; diuretics in low doses will probably be used more frequently for second-line therapy. In recognition of their lack of adverse lipid effects and their tolerability, first-line therapy with alpha blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists will become increasingly common. The goal of antihypertensive therapy will be to extend the life expectancy of hypertensive patients to that of subjects without high blood pressure; hopefully, these new treatment approaches will bring us closer to that goal. \nSuccessful repair of a submitral left ventricular infected pseudoaneurysm. Aneurysms of the left ventricle may be congenital or may occur after a myocardial infarction, trauma, or endocarditis. Infective endocarditis can cause destructive injury to the heart in various ways. This report describes the formation of an aneurysm of the left ventricle from trauma of a bacterial vegetation of the mitral valve. Early recognition by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging led to successful repair and prevented a catastrophic result. \nLateral parabrachial nucleus and angiotensin II-induced hypertension. The objective of this study was to determine if ablation of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) would prevent angiotensin II-induced hypertension in rats. Thirteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Bilateral electrolytic lesions in the LPBN were produced in six rats; the remaining seven rats were subjected to sham lesion surgery only. All rats were instrumented with vascular catheters and housed in metabolism cages. Daily measurements during the 16-day protocol included arterial pressure, heart rate, water intake, urine output, and urinary sodium excretion. Periodically throughout the protocol depressor responses to ganglion blockade and to blockade of V1-type vasopressin receptors also were measured. The protocol was divided into three control-period days, 10 days of continuous (24 hr/day) angiotensin II infusion (10 ng/min i.v.), and three recovery-period days. There were no significant differences between the two groups of rats for any variable during the control period. During angiotensin II infusion, sham-lesion rats exhibited a progressive increase in arterial pressure and the depressor response to ganglion blockade and a decrease in urinary sodium excretion. No other variable was significantly changed. In rats with LPBN lesions, arterial pressure was significantly increased only on days 1 and 3 of angiotensin II infusion. No other variable was affected. It was concluded that ablation of the LPBN in rats prevented sustained hypertension during intravenous infusion of angiotensin II by interfering with neurogenic pressor mechanisms normally activated by the peptide. \nBladder and sphincter behavior in patients with spinal cord lesions. To ascertain the relationship between the clinical neurological level, and bladder and sphincter behavior, the video-urodynamic studies of 489 patients with spinal cord lesions due to a variety of causes were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified based on the clinical neurological level, etiology of the lesion and presence or absence of signs of sacral cord involvement. Urodynamic findings were classified as either detrusor hyperreflexia, detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia, detrusor areflexia or normal. The results indicate that although there was a general correlation between the neurological level of injury and the expected vesicourethral function, it was neither absolute nor specific. For example, 20 of 117 cervical cord lesions had detrusor areflexia, 42 of 156 lumbar cord lesions had detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia and 26 of 84 sacral cord had either detrusor hyperreflexia or detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia. However, if one considers the presence of neurological abnormalities, 84% of the suprasacral cord lesions with detrusor areflexia have sacral cord signs. In contrast, all suprasacral cord lesions with no evidence of sacral cord involvement have either detrusor hyperreflexia or detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia. The positive predictive value for positive sacral cord signs and detrusor areflexia was 87%. The positive predictive value for negative sacral cord signs and detrusor hyperreflexia/detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia was 81%. These data suggest that the clinical neurological examination alone is not an adequate barometer to predict neurourological dysfunction and that video-urodynamic evaluation provides a more precise diagnosis for each patient. \nThe submandibular triangle in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and hypopharynx. A 15-year retrospective analysis was carried out at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, reviewing the tumor staging and pathology data of 239 patients treated for carcinoma of the larynx and hypopharynx requiring laryngectomy alone, laryngectomy with neck dissection, or laryngopharyngectomy and neck dissection. Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 205 of the 239 cases, with the remaining 34 having surgery to treat radiation therapy failure. Primary tumors were located within the supraglottic region, the glottic region and, less commonly, the pyriform sinus. Ninety-five of the 239 patients either presented with or developed nodal metastases following initial treatment. Of these, only two had tumors within the lymph nodes of the submandibular triangle. This data corroborates impressions that tumors of the larynx and hypopharynx rarely metastasize to the submandibular triangle and that sparing this area during neck dissection for lesions of the larynx would seem justified. \nCardiac disturbances during the administration of taxol. The clinical development of taxol, a new antimicrotubule agent with a unique mechanism of cytotoxic action, has proceeded slowly due to serious hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) and shortages in its supply. Nevertheless, large-scale phase II trials have been initiated as taxol has recently demonstrated impressive activity in advanced and cisplatin-refractory ovarian carcinoma. Furthermore, the incidence of HSRs has been reduced substantially with premedications and modifications in the administration schedule. However, various manifestations of potential cardiotoxicity have been observed in several patients who participated in four phase I and II studies of taxol. Asymptomatic bradycardia has occurred in a high proportion of patients, including 29% of ovarian cancer patients who were treated with maximally tolerated doses of taxol in a phase II study. More profound cardiac disturbances, including a range of atrioventricular conduction blocks, left bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and manifestations of cardiac ischemia, have been observed in seven of 140 patients (5%) who received taxol. Descriptions of these events are presented in this report to alert investigators to the potential for these adverse effects. Although these disturbances did not result in serious sequelae in most patients, investigators should continue to maintain a high degree of caution until precise risk factors, frequency, and clinical significance of these adverse cardiac effects are determined. \nFactors affecting the rearrangement efficiency of an Ig test gene. A rearrangement test gene, pHRD, containing the mouse IgH enhancer and the metallothionein promoter, has previously been shown to rearrange efficiently after transfection into a pre-B cell line. Experiments are now reported that assess the requirements of the DNA substrate as well as of the transfected cells for efficient rearrangement. It was found that deletion of the metallothionein promoter or substitution of the IgH enhancer by the kappa enhancer did not affect rearrangement. However, deletion of the Ig enhancer reduced the efficiency. Transfection of pHRD into stable hybrids of pre-B cells and myeloma cells resulted in a high frequency of rearrangement only if certain myeloma chromosomes were lost. Furthermore, pHRD introduced into rearrangement incompetent myeloma cells upon subsequent cell fusion with pre-B cells was rearranged only very rarely and then apparently only immediately after cell fusion. Stable pre-B cell x myeloma hybrids that retained the critical myeloma chromosomes were found to have lost VDJ recombinase activity and transcripts of the RAG-1, RAG-2 and TdT genes. It is concluded that transcription, i.e., the copying of the DNA by polymerase, is probably not required for rearrangement, but that the rearrangement substrate must be in an \"open\" chromatin state, such as may be provided by transcriptional factors. Furthermore, the absence of rearrangement in myeloma cells is apparently due to the continued action of an inhibitor of rearrangement. \nEffects of subsequent pregnancy on left ventricular function in peripartum cardiomyopathy. Pregnancy has been discouraged in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) to avoid the risk of precipitating recurrent or progressive left ventricular dysfunction. We assessed left ventricular size and contractile function using echocardiography in four PPCM patients prior to pregnancy, during the third trimester, and a mean of 6 weeks postpartum. Left ventricular mean diameters at end diastole and at end systole prior to pregnancy (5.2 +/- 0.3 and 3.0 +/- 0.2 cm, respectively) did not change during pregnancy (5.2 +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.2 cm). Similarly, left ventricular fractional shortening did not alter significantly during pregnancy or postpartum. Furthermore, no patient developed any symptoms or signs of left ventricular failure. All patients had normal babies, including one who had twins. We conclude that PPCM patients whose left ventricular function returns to normal may undertake further pregnancy with a normal fetal outcome and a low risk of recurrent left ventricular dysfunction. \nSmoking and mortality among older men and women in three communities. BACKGROUND. Although cigarette smoking is the leading avoidable cause of premature death in middle age, some have claimed that no association is present among older persons. METHODS. We prospectively examined the relation of cigarette-smoking habits with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular causes, and cancer among 7178 persons 65 years of age or older without a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cancer who lived in one of three communities: East Boston, Massachusetts; Iowa and Washington counties, Iowa; and New Haven, Connecticut. At the time of the initial interview, prevalence rates of smoking in the three communities ranged from 5.2 to 17.8 percent among women and from 14.2 to 25.8 percent among men. During five years of follow-up there were 1442 deaths, 729 due to cardiovascular disease and 316 due to cancer. RESULTS. In both sexes, rates of total mortality among current smokers were twice what they were among participants who had never smoked. Relative risks, as adjusted for age and community, were 2.1 among the men (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 2.7) and 1.8 among the women (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.4). Current smokers had higher rates of cardiovascular mortality than those who had never smoked (as adjusted for age and community, the relative risk was 2.0 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.9] among the men and 1.6 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.3] among the women), as well as increased rates of cancer mortality (relative risk, 2.4 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.1] among the men and 2.4 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.9] among the women). In both sexes, former smokers had rates of cardiovascular mortality similar to those of the participants who had never smoked, regardless of age at cessation, whereas the rates for all cancers, as well as smoking-related cancers, remained elevated among men who had once smoked. CONCLUSIONS. Our prospective findings indicate that the mortality hazards of smoking extend well into later life, and suggest that cessation will continue to improve life expectancy in older people. \nPulmonary vascular reactivity in Fischer rats. We previously reported that Fischer (F) rat lungs developed more extensive injury when challenged with oxidants than age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat lungs. We now describe a reduced pulmonary vascular response to alveolar hypoxia and angiotensin II (ANG II) in F compared with SD rats. The comparative studies were performed with isolated lungs perfused with salt solution or blood, catheter-implanted awake rats, and isolated main pulmonary arterial rings. Isolated lungs from F rats perfused with either blood or salt solution had reduced vasoconstriction in comparison with lungs from SD rats when exposed to alveolar hypoxia or challenged with ANG II. Instrumented awake F rats had a smaller mean increase in total pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) than SD rats (35 vs. 94 mmHg.min.l-1, P less than 0.05) when challenged with 8% oxygen. The contractile response of isolated pulmonary artery but not thoracic aortic rings to KCl and ANG II was reduced in F compared with SD rats. In addition, F rats exposed to 4 wk of hypobaric hypoxia developed less pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy (when corrected for the hematocrit) than SD rats. We conclude that the oxidant stress-sensitive inbred F rat strain is characterized by a lung vascular bed that is relatively unresponsive to vasoconstricting stimuli. The mechanism underlying this genetic difference in lung vascular control remains to be defined. \nHerniated cervical disk presenting as ischemic chest pain. Myocardial ischemia must be the first concern of every emergency physician in evaluating chest pain in the adult patient. Any suspicion of myocardial ischemia must be promptly evaluated and admitted. The American College of Emergency Physicians has recently published a standards document on the care of chest pain in the adult patient. The emergency physician must be familiar with this document. Once myocardial ischemia and other life-threatening causes are ruled out, one can consider that cervical disk disease may be the cause of chest pain. We present two cases of patients who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac ischemia. Both patients were found to have herniated cervical disks. Subsequent surgical repair completely relieved their symptoms. Evaluation of the literature shows that this entity was well described from 1950 to the 1960s. Most recent discussions do not mention disk herniation as even an infrequent cause of chest pain. If there is no life-threatening disease present, one should consider cervical disk disease. \nObstructed central venous catheters. Restoring function with a 12-hour infusion of low-dose urokinase. Thrombotic obstruction frequently prohibits infusion through or withdrawal of blood from central venous catheters and can occur in conjunction with symptomatic thrombosis of the subclavian vein. Thirty catheters were radiographically proved to be obstructed by thrombus and had not responded to at least one instillation of 5000 units of urokinase. All catheters were treated with a 12-hour infusion of urokinase at the rate of 40,000 units/hour. The obstructing thrombus was either eliminated or reduced in size in all instances and full function was restored in all but one catheter. No bleeding complications were seen. Six patients with obstructed catheters also had symptoms of subclavian vein thrombosis. All patients with symptoms of subclavian vein obstruction became asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy even though no attempt at dissolving the thrombus obstructing the subclavian vein was made. A 12-hour infusion of low doses of urokinase can safely salvage function of obstructed catheters that otherwise may require replacement. Patients with concomitant subclavian vein thrombosis become asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy without need to dissolve the obstructing thrombus. \nDiabetes mellitus and localizations of obliterating arterial disease of the lower limbs. Thirty patients with intermittent claudication (IC) and treated diabetes mellitus and 30 age- and gender-matched nondiabetic claudicants underwent a vascular examination by noninvasive ultrasound methods (continuous-wave Doppler, duplex scanner). The ankle/arm systolic pressure index did not differ in the two groups. Diabetic patients with IC had more (p less than .001) non-flow-reducing stenoses (lumen reduction less than 50%) and fewer (p less than .002) flow-reducing obstructions (lumen reduction greater than 50%) of the iliac arteries than nondiabetics had. These data are consistent with a preferentially distal (below the inguinal ligament) localization of arterial stenoses in diabetic patients, whereas iliac artery diseases are relatively more severe in nondiabetics. \nA prospective evaluation of arterial intimal injuries in an experimental model. The management of arterial intimal defects remains controversial because of uncertainty concerning their natural history. We developed an experimental canine model to prospectively evaluate posterior wall intimal flaps in the superficial femoral artery. Arterial intimal flaps were constructed in 20 anesthetized dogs (40 arteries) and evaluated by arteriography, and angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. Postoperative patency rates at 1 (n = 20) and 3 weeks (n = 20) were compared with a control group of ten animals (n = 20, arteriotomy without intimal flap). Acute thromboses occurred in five experimental arteries with thromboses of eight additional experimental arteries at followup. Control patency was 100%, while experimental group patencies were 75% (p less than 0.05) at 1 week and 60% (p less than 0.009) at 3 weeks. All thrombosed arteries had intimal flaps with greater than 75% luminal stenosis. We conclude that intimal injuries cause arterial thromboses acutely and during subsequent followup. Intimal flaps with stenosis greater than 75% as determined arteriographically are at greatest risk for thrombosis. Angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound characterize arterial intimal defects and may delineate injuries requiring surgical or endovascular repair. \nInternal biliary drainage, parenteral nutrition, and variation in the total parenteral nutrition feeding solutions: influence on the healing of colon anastomosis in jaundiced rats. The influence of preoperative internal biliary drainage and various types of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the healing of a colon anastomosis in 50 jaundiced rats was investigated. Jaundice was induced by division and ligation of the common bile duct. After 5 days a colon anastomosis was made. Ten days thereafter the bursting pressure of the anastomosis was measured as an assessment of wound healing. Bursting pressures were significantly lower in jaundiced rats compared with a sham-operated nonjaundiced group. Preoperative internal biliary drainage significantly improved bursting pressure (p less than 0.001) as did preoperative TPN (p less than 0.001). In the second part of the study the influence of four different feeding solutions on the healing of a colon anastomosis was tested. Solutions with and without 20% fat emulsion and a solution with branched-chain amino acids were tested as well as glucose only. No significant differences were observed among these four groups on the parameters tested. \nAngelchik prosthesis complicates treatment of adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Indications for use of the Angelchik prosthesis remain controversial, and many surgeons actively involved in the treatment of reflux disease have not used the device. We describe a case that illustrates difficulties associated with resection of a tumor in the presence of this prothesis. Such experience suggests that patients known to have Barrett's esophagus might be better treated with standard antireflux procedures. \nSix-year experience with a comprehensive approach to the treatment of recurrent childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-REZ BFM 85). A relapse study of the BFM group. Between April 1985 and March 1987 130 children and adolescents up to 18 years of age with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were registered on the stratified and randomized multicentric trial ALL-REZ BFM 85 designed for patients pretreated with intensive front-line therapies. Stratification criteria were time and site of relapse: bone marrow (BM) relapse on or up to 6 months after stopping front-line therapy (group A), BM relapse beyond 6 months after therapy (group B), and isolated extramedullary relapse at any time (group C). Treatment consisted of alternating courses of polychemotherapy including randomly administered high- or intermediate-dose methotrexate (HDMTX:12 g/m2 as 4-hour infusion; IDMTX: 1 g/m2 as 36-hour infusion). During maintenance therapy the patients received daily oral thioguanine and biweekly intravenous (IV) MTX. The overall second complete remission (CR) rate was 92% (groups A, B, and C: 88%, 92%, and 100%), and the probability of event-free survival (EFS) at 6 years is 0.31 +/- 0.04 (groups A, B, and C: 0.18 +/- 0.05, 0.30 +/- 0.07, and 0.72 +/- 0.11). HDMTX did not prove to be superior to IDMTX, which led to premature stopping of randomization. Risk factor analyses showed early relapse, particularly BM relapse within 18 months, and T-cell phenotype to be independent predictors of poor outcome. The incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapses following BM relapse was 19%, indicating that reprophylaxis to the CNS with IV/intrathecal (IT) MTX was insufficient. For 17 children who received bone marrow transplantation in second CR from HLA-compatible siblings the EFS was 0.53 +/- 0.12 at 5 years. Their outcome was not influenced by the above-mentioned risk factors. With the proposed treatment regimen long-lasting second remissions can be achieved in about one third of patients even after intensive front-line treatment. \nValidity of cerebrovascular mortality rates. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates are being increasingly used to establish a relationship with coronary heart disease risk factors. Cerebrovascular mortality rates suffer from the same general defects as coronary heart disease mortality rates but with greater diagnostic error in regard to subdivisions of CVD or stroke. These vital statistics, whether national or regional, are too inaccurate for scientific use and cannot be regarded as representing true mortality rates for any country. Moreover, clinical CVD is an inappropriate surrogate for severity of atherosclerosis, providing inexact data and allowing indeterminate overlap in epidemiologic studies. \nTumor regulation of hepatic glutamine metabolism. Fast-growing tumors are major glutamine consumers and may alter host glutamine metabolism to benefit the tumor. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the liver switches from an organ of glutamine balance to one of glutamine release with progressive malignant growth. However, the regulation of this change is unclear. This study examined tumor modulation of hepatic glutamine metabolism by determining the activities of glutaminase, the principle enzyme of glutamine degradation, and glutamine synthetase, the principal enzyme of glutamine synthesis. Hepatic glutamine content was also determined. Rats with a fast-growing subcutaneous fibrosarcoma (TBR) and pair-fed controls were studied at 2 and 3 weeks after tumor or sham implantation, when the tumors comprised approximately 5% and 20% of total body weight. Arterial glutamine fell with progressive tumor growth (608 +/- 26 mumol/L in controls vs 494 +/- 15 in TBR, p less than 0.005) and was not attributable to a diminished food intake. Hepatic glutamine content was increased 45% (p less than 0.01) in tumor rats at 2 weeks due in part to a 35% fall in liver glutaminase activity. At 3 weeks, glutamine synthetase activity increased by 43% (0.58 +/- 0.07 mumol/mg of protein/hr in controls vs 0.83 +/- 0.04 in TBR, p less than 0.01) whereas glutaminase remained depressed (2.68 +/- 0.12 mumol/mg of protein/hr in controls vs 2.22 +/- 0.15 in TBR, p less than 0.05) and glutamine content fell compared to 2 week tumor-bearing rats, consistent with accelerated hepatic glutamine release. Tumors may alter liver glutamine metabolism by modulating hepatic enzyme activity in order to provide circulating glutamine for the growing malignancy. \nPhase I trial of fluorouracil modulation by N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate and 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside: optimization of 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside dose and schedule through biochemical analysis of sequential tumor biopsy specimens. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that the selective antitumor activity of fluorouracil (5-FU) is enhanced by agents which perturb certain intracellular nucleotide pools. We previously demonstrated that the combination of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), which depletes pyrimidine nucleotide pools, and 5-FU yielded a 43% response rate among 37 assessable patients with colorectal carcinoma. In preclinical tumor models, 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside (MMPR), an inhibitor of purine synthesis, elevates phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) pools and promotes the anabolism of 5-FU to fluorinated nucleotides. In vivo, the addition of MMPR enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PALA-5-FU. In a phase I trial, we sought to determine the optimal dose and schedule of MMPR in combination with PALA (250 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-FU (1300 mg/m2 by 24-hour infusion on day 2). MMPR (75-225 mg/m2) was given intravenously on day 1 to 27 patients with solid tumors (15 colorectal, seven breast, five other). Toxic effects were mild to moderate and included leukopenia, mucositis, nausea, or rash. Two of seven patients given MMPR at 225 mg/m2 had grade 3 diarrhea. PRPP was measured using a [14C]orotic acid 14CO2 release assay in tumor biopsy specimens obtained before and 12 hours and 24 hours after MMPR doses were given to 20 patients. The addition of MMPR elevated PRPP pools in human solid tumors. At 12 hours after treatment, two (50%) of four patients showed a twofold or greater elevation of PRPP at the MMPR dose level of 75 mg/m2; a similar elevation was observed in five (71%) of seven patients given 150 mg/m2 MMPR and in three (43%) of seven patients given 225 mg/m2 MMPR. At 24 hours after treatment, results for the respective dose levels of MMPR were two (33%) of six patients, one (20%) of five patients, and four (57%) of seven patients. Administration of the two highest MMPR dose levels appeared to result in a greater increase in tumor PRPP levels. However, toxicity was greater at the 225 mg/m2 dose level; therefore, the 150 mg/m2 dose level was favored. Tumor levels of PRPP decreased between 12 hours and 24 hours in nine (56%) of 16 patients. This time course indicates that MMPR should be administered at the beginning of the 24-hour infusion of 5-FU. \nAge-dependent increase in deleted mitochondrial DNA in the human heart: possible contributory factor to presbycardia. Cardiac function deteriorates with age, and endogenous damage to mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) is believed to be a major contributory factor to aging. Mitochondria occupy a pivotal position in energy metabolism, and mitochondria have their own DNA, which encodes 13 subunits of the mitochondrial energy transducing system. Other subunits are encoded by nuclear DNA. DNA has been shown to have a high mutation rate, and genetic mutation might primarily be ascribed to mtDNA mutation in the energy transducing system. Recent advances in gene technology, especially in polymerase chain reactions (PCR), permit us to analyze mtDNA mutations in a small quantity of tissue. We devised rapid and accurate methods to detect mitochondrial mutations--the primer shift PCR method, PCR-Southern method, the modified primer shift PCR method, and the asymmetric PCR method. With these methods, we analyzed myocardia mtDNA in human cadavers of various ages (from 3 years old to 97 years old, mean 57 years old). The 7.4 kb deletion of mtDNA was commonly detected in elderly subjects, and the proportion of deleted mtDNA to normal mtDNA increased with age. Deleted mtDNA was observed in all subjects that were over 70 years old. The mutation was based on the directly repeated sequence: 5'-CATCAA-CAACCG-3', which exists in both the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene and the displacement loop (D-loop) region. Replication impairment occurred at that directly repeated sequence, which caused the elimination of genomes between the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene and the D-loop region and resulted in a 7.4 kb deletion. \nT-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder arising in a background of autoimmune disease and terminating in plasma cell dyscrasia with primary amyloidosis. T-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder, a syndrome of T-cell lymphocytosis with neutropenia has been described in patients with various autoimmune disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis. We report a case of T-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder occurring in a 42-year-old white woman with a long history of dermatitis herpetiformis and subsequent development of Coomb's positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia and polymyositis. The peripheral blood lymphocytes showed the T-suppressor cell phenotype (CD2-, CD3-, CD8-, and CD4-). DNA analysis of the peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed a T-cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangement and an immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement. The patient's course was marked by numerous bouts of infection. The unique factor in this patient was the development of a plasma cell dyscrasia and amyloidosis prior to death. \nIs a single quinsy an indication for tonsillectomy? There has recently been some discussion on whether a single quinsy is an indication for tonsillectomy. This paper presents a retrospective study of 36 patients who presented with a quinsy over the past 37 years but did not have interval tonsillectomy. Prolonged follow-up shows that the rate of recurrence of a quinsy can double compared to the recurrence rate under 5 years. Despite this it remains relatively low and an uncomplicated quinsy does not warrant tonsillectomy. \nTotal coronary occlusion: a different animal? Provided collateralization is adequate, a chronic total coronary occlusion clinically imitates a 90% stenosis but is exempt from the risk of myocardial infarction. For angioplasty of vessels with chronic total coronary occlusion, technical difficulties and clinical risks are balanced against projected subjective benefit and amount of viable myocardium concerned. The primary success rate is approximately 65% and complications are rare because abrupt vessel reclosure may be common but is harmless. New Q wave infarction in that context has not been reported. The duration of occlusion is the most important predictor of success. The length of the occluded segment is also important. Recurrence averages 68% (21% reocclusion and 47% restenosis) and happens typically within 6 months. The high recurrence rate is due to competitive pressure exerted by collateral vessels and an often suboptimal local result. Even if the primary success rate of angioplasty in vessels with chronic total coronary occlusion can be improved by advanced technology and skill, the clinical yield will remain low compared with that of angioplasty of stenoses. Because low yield procedures must be low risk and low cost, there are definite limits to how sophisticated, risky and expensive new techniques can become. Derivatives of conventional balloon systems are likely to remain the equipment of first choice, perhaps complemented by mechanical drills. Although chronic total coronary occlusions are no clinical menace in contrast to stenoses, they frequently deserve revascularization and are the reason to select bypass surgery over angioplasty. These factors justify endeavors to improve recanalization techniques that help to refine coronary angioplasty of nontotal lesions, because total occlusion, albeit a different animal, is of the same species. \nEffects of long-term amiodarone therapy on the defibrillation threshold and the rate of shocks of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The effects of long-term amiodarone therapy on the defibrillation thresholds and the rate of shocks were evaluated in 62 patients who had implantation of an automatic cardioverter-defibrillator (n = 53) or prophylactic implantation of patch electrodes (n = 9) who were survivors of sudden cardiac death (n = 34) or had refractory rapid ventricular tachycardia (n = 28). There were 53 men and 9 women, with ages ranging from 18 to 76 years (mean +/- SD, 60 +/- 12). Coronary artery disease occurred in 50 patients (80.6%), cardiomyopathy occurred in six (9.7%), valvular heart disease developed in two (3.2%), primary electrical disease developed in two (3.2%), hypertensive heart disease materialized in one (1.6%), and Ebstein's anomaly occurred in one (1.6%). The left ventricular ejection fraction varied from 10% to 75% (mean, 37 +/- 17%). All patients had failed a mean of 3.9 +/- 1.6 antiarrhythmic drugs prior to implantation of the device. Twenty-eight patients (45%) were taking amiodarone up to the time of surgery, with a mean daily dose of 406 +/- 147 mg (range 200 to 800) and for a mean duration of 6.0 +/- 6.7 months (range 1 to 36 months). The mean defibrillation threshold (DFT) was 12.0 +/- 4.4 joules (range 5 to 20) in the group taking amiodarone and was not significantly different from that of the group not taking amiodarone (n = 32) (mean DFT 12.3 +/- 5.5 joules, range 5 to 30; p = 0.77). \nIncreased occurrence of arrhythmias in men with ischaemic type ST-segment depression during long-term ECG recording. Prognostic impact on ischaemic heart disease: results from the prospective population study 'Men born in 1914', Malmo, Sweden. The objective of this long-term ECG (LTER) study in 394 68-year-old men, selected at random from the general population of Malmo, Sweden, was to determine the prevalence and occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and their impact on morbidity and mortality from IHD. According to Lown classification, 29.4% (116 men) had ventricular arrhythmia (VA) group 4-5. Serious ventricular arrhythmia (Lown group 4-5) was more common in men with asymptomatic ischaemic type ST-segment depression (STD) than in those without it (37.8% vs. 26.7%: P less than 0.05). During the mean follow-up period of 53.1 months there were seven IHD deaths (6%) among the 116 patients with VA, Lown 4-5, and nine IHD deaths (3.2%) among the 278 patients without serious VA, Lown 0-3, (P = 0.26). Six and three of these deaths, respectively, were considered to be sudden (P = 0.022). The increased cardiac event rate (fatal or non-fatal MI or deaths due to chronic IHD) associated with a serious ventricular arrhythmia disappeared when history of IHD at baseline and occurrence of STD during LTER were taken into account. The study did not provide any evidence to suggest that ventricular arrhythmia was triggered by myocardial ischaemia. Five of 9 (56%) deaths due to IHD in men with STD occurred among the 38% (37/98) of patients who belonged to Lown class 4-5. It is concluded that the prognostic information derived from LTER can be improved by combined monitoring of STD and ventricular arrhythmias. \nRestenosis 1 to 24 months after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty: a necropsy study of 20 patients. This report describes clinical, morphologic and histologic findings at necropsy late (range 1.6 to 24.1 months [average 8.2 months]) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty in 20 patients with coronary angioplasty restenosis. Clinical evidence of restenosis occurred in 14 patients (70%), including 6 patients with sudden coronary death. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) had a cardiac cause of death and 6 (30%) had a noncardiac cause of death. Two major subgroups of histologic findings were observed: 1) intimal proliferation (60%), and 2) atherosclerotic plaque only (40%). Of the eight sites with atherosclerotic plaque only, six were eccentric lesions and two were concentric lesions. No morphologic evidence of previous angioplasty injury (cracks, breaks, tears) was observed in the eight patients with atherosclerotic plaque only. Proposed mechanisms for the development of intimal proliferation involve the reaction of smooth muscle cells and platelets, whereas elastic recoil of overstretched eccentric or concentric atherosclerotic lesions represents the most likely explanation for the findings in the latter subgroup. On the basis of these morphologic findings at angioplasty restenosis sites, specific treatment strategies for restenosis after coronary artery balloon angioplasty are proposed. \nChemotherapy and radiation therapy for anal carcinoma. Survival and late morbidity. This study was performed to evaluate the survival and late morbidity rates of a widely used combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimen given to patients with carcinoma of the anal canal. One hundred six patients received radiation therapy (5000 cGy given by two anteroposterior-posteroanterior [AP-PA] opposed fields) and chemotherapy (mitomycin C plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) from 1983 to 1989. Patients with primary tumors (n = 86) had a complete response rate of 84% and a 5-year survival rate of 72%. There was no significant difference in survival rate according to tumor stage. Patients with local recurrence (n = 20) after primary surgery had a complete response rate of 50% and a 5-year survival rate of 40%. Fifteen percent of the patients experienced late treatment-related symptoms including anal incontinence, intestinal obstruction, and chronic pelvic pain. The current treatment regimen is effective but carries a considerable risk of complications. As survival rate was independent of tumor stage, the locoregional treatment should probably be less extensive for small tumors than for advanced tumors. This strategy may reduce the late side effects for patients with small tumors without reducing the survival rate. \nSonography of the gallbladder: significance of striated (layered) thickening of the gallbladder wall. Sonographic identification of thickening of the gallbladder wall that consists of multiple striations (alternate hypoechoic and hyperechoic layers) has been considered strong evidence of the presence of acute cholecystitis. We studied 27 patients in whom sonograms showed striated thickening of the gallbladder wall to determine the diagnostic significance of this finding. Striations were classified as focal or diffuse. Sonograms were correlated with pathologic findings in 16 patients and with clinical diagnoses and laboratory findings in 11. Patients were categorized as having cholecystitis with or without gangrene or edema of the gallbladder wall unrelated to gallbladder disease. Striated thickening of the gallbladder wall was due to cholecystitis in 10 patients, and all 10 had gangrenous changes at surgery or at pathologic examination. Striations were focal in eight of these patients and diffuse in two. Striated thickening of the gallbladder wall was due to edema of the wall unrelated to gallbladder disease in 17 patients. Causes included congestive heart failure (n = 4), renal failure (n = 5), liver disease (hepatic failure [n = 1], hepatitis [n = 6]), ascites (n = 2), hypoalbuminemia (n = 3), pancreatitis (n = 1), blockage of the lymphatic/venous drainage of the gallbladder (n = 2), and prominent Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (n = 1). More than one abnormality was present in five patients. Striations were focal in 11 of these patients and diffuse in six. The sonographic finding of striated gallbladder wall thickening is no more specific for cholecystitis than the observation of gallbladder wall thickening by itself, and it may occur in a variety of diseases. However, in the clinical setting of acute cholecystitis, the presence of striations suggests gangrenous changes in the gallbladder. The extent of the striations (focal or diffuse) is not useful in predicting the cause of the striated gallbladder wall thickening. \nAnastomotic recurrence of carcinoma of the colon and rectum. The value of endoscopy and serum CEA levels. The early diagnosis of anastomotic recurrence after surgery for carcinoma of the colon and rectum is difficult. Whether repeat colonoscopy and serial serum CEA measurements were useful in diagnosing early anastomotic recurrence was examined. A total of 112 patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum who had undergone resection and anastomosis were followed with frequent colonoscopy and serum CEA measurements. Seventeen patients developed anastomotic recurrence. Fourteen patients had elevated serum CEA levels, and 15 patients had endoscopic evidence suggesting recurrence at the anastomotic site. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated metastatic disease in seven patients, localized anastomotic disease in six patients, and no evidence of disease in four patients. Laparotomy was then carried out in 10 patients. In eight of 10 patients, it was possible to resect localized disease. In a 3-year follow-up study, eight patients were alive, four without any evidence of recurrent disease. Repeat colonoscopy and serum CEA measurements are recommended as postoperative surveillance for carcinoma of the colon and rectum. In select cases laparotomy and resection may prolong survival. \nSignificance of atherosclerotic changes of the ascending aorta during coronary bypass surgery with intraoperative detection by echography. Intraoperative echographic studies of the ascending aorta were carried out on 100 of 222 patients having primary coronary bypass surgeries between May 1987 and December 1988. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of echographic study in evaluating the nature of atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta and its incidence and relationship to perioperative cerebrovascular complications in coronary bypass surgery. It was possible to obtain clear echographic images of the aortic wall in these 100 patients which were divided into two groups according to the degree of the degenerative process. Three of 13 patients (23%) (Group II) with severe atherosclerotic changes, suffered perioperative cerebrovascular complications, and early surgical mortality in 2 patients (15%) was caused by cerebrovascular complications. These complications were not seen in 87 patients with less than moderate atherosclerotic changes (Group I). \nImmediate effect of vagotomy on pancreatic insulin secretion. The effect of vagotomy and gastric resection on insulin secretion was examined by the glucagon stimulated C-peptide test in gastrectomy patients (n = 11) without truncal vagotomy and in total gastrectomy patients (n = 10) with truncal vagotomy. The test was performed twice in each patient: 10 minutes after the midline incision was made and then 60 to 90 minutes later when gastric resection or total gastrectomy was completed, during the reconstructive phase of the operation. Gastric resection without truncal vagotomy was followed by a higher increase (48%) in serum C-peptide concentration caused by glucagon stimulation than total gastrectomy with truncal vagotomy (13%). There was a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the glucagon stimulated glucose-related C-peptide concentration in patients without truncal vagotomy, whereas truncal vagotomy inhibited this increase. These results suggest that truncal vagotomy will produce a reduction in stimulated insulin secretion in humans. \nTranexamic acid treatment of hemothorax in two patients with malignant mesothelioma. Patients with malignant mesothelioma may present with hemothorax. We used a combination of oral and intrapleural tranexamic acid to treat two patients with this severe complication. Initiation of treatment with this potent anti-fibrinolytic drug resulted in rapid reduction of bleeding and of transfusion requirements. \nEmergency management of the adult female rape victim. Estimates are that one in every six women is raped during her lifetime. The family physician must be able to evaluate and treat the rape victim in the emergency setting. A detailed history, careful physical examination, collection of medical specimens for legal purposes, assessment of the patient's psychologic state, prophylaxis of venereal disease and pregnancy counseling are required. \nIncreased cell membrane arachidonic acid in experimental colorectal tumours. Tumour cell membrane fatty acid composition was investigated using an animal model of colorectal carcinogenesis. Eighty six male Wistar rats were fed experimental diets containing either 5% saturated fat or 20% saturated fat. Colorectal tumours were induced by intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane, and control rats received saline. Animals were killed at intervals up to 26 weeks after the last injection of carcinogen for histology and lipid analysis. Cell membrane fatty acids in colonic mucosa and colorectal tumours were determined by gas liquid chromatography. Animals fed the 20% fat diet developed more carcinomas (28 cancers in 14 rats) than those fed the 5% fat diet (14 cancers in 15 rats; chi 2 = 8.03, p = 0.0046) but they did not develop significantly more adenomas (28 and 24 respectively). Cell membrane fatty acid analysis showed a considerable increase in the content of arachidonic acid (20:4, n-6) in the tumours (mean (SEM) 11.7 (1.5)%) compared with colonic mucosa (4.2 (0.4)%; p less than 0.05). Dietary fatty acid composition was also found to influence the profile of fatty acids in the colonic mucosa. This study suggests that a high saturated fat diet promotes the malignant transformation of colorectal adenomas. The colorectal tumours were characterised by an increased cell membrane arachidonic acid, the precursor of putative cancer promoting prostaglandins. \nOrifice variability of the stenotic aortic valve: evaluation before and after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. The effects of balloon aortic valvuloplasty on orifice variability of the stenotic sclerocalcific aortic valve were evaluated by hemodynamic measurements of aortic valve function in 14 patients before balloon aortic valvuloplasty, during nitroprusside infusion before valvuloplasty, 48 h after valvuloplasty and during nitroprusside infusion 48 h after valvuloplasty. Aortic valve function was assessed by aortic valve area calculations with use of the Gorlin and Cannon formulas. Nitroprusside infusion before balloon aortic valvuloplasty caused no change in mean aortic valve gradient but a significant increase in mean aortic transvalvular flow from 186 +/- 46 to 202 +/- 61 ml/s (p less than 0.05), in Gorlin aortic valve area from 0.49 +/- 0.17 to 0.53 +/- 0.21 cm2 (p less than 0.05) and in Cannon aortic valve area from 0.45 +/- 0.18 to 0.49 +/- 0.22 cm2 (p less than 0.05). Nitroprusside infusion 48 h after valvuloplasty induced no change in mean aortic valve gradient but a significant increase in mean aortic transvalvular flow from 214 +/- 61 to 254 +/- 78 ml/s (p less than 0.005), in Gorlin aortic valve area from 0.71 +/- 0.25 to 0.83 +/- 0.32 cm2 (p less than 0.01) and in Cannon aortic valve area from 0.78 +/- 0.33 to 0.88 +/- 0.40 cm2 (p less than 0.05). Forty-eight hours after valvuloplasty, nitroprusside infusion induced a larger increase (40 +/- 40 ml/s) in mean transvalvular flow than before valvuloplasty (16 +/- 27 ml/s; p less than 0.05) and a larger increase (0.12 +/- 0.14 cm2) in Gorlin aortic valve area than before valvuloplasty (0.05 +/- 0.07 cm2; p less than 0.05). \nTissue plasminogen activator reduces brain injury in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke. Tissue plasminogen activator is an endogenous fibrin-specific serine protease with potent thrombolytic activity. We investigated the efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator in reducing cerebral infarct size after thromboembolic stroke in a rabbit model. Seventeen rabbits were randomized to receive either tissue plasminogen activator (2.5 mg/kg, n = 6) or vehicle control (n = 11). We controlled mean arterial pressure, hematocrit, and arterial blood gases before and after the intracarotid embolization of an autologous clot. Cerebral blood flow (cm3/100 g/min) (mean +/- SEM) was immediately reduced from 55.2 +/- 7.7 to 8.5 +/- 2.5 in the control group and from 61.8 +/- 14.8 to 10.0 +/- 3.5 in the treated group after embolization. Cerebral blood flow recovered significantly within 60 minutes of thrombolytic therapy and attained a value of 59.6 +/- 10.0 cm3/100 g/min 4 hours after embolization, whereas cerebral blood flow in control animals demonstrated only a minimal recovery to 15.3 +/- 8.9 cm3/100 g/min. Cerebral infarct size (percent of hemisphere) was reduced from 34.4 +/- 5.6% in control animals to 8.8 +/- 5.6% in treated animals (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that tissue plasminogen activator may be efficacious in restoring cerebral blood flow and thus limiting infarct size in acute thromboembolic stroke. \nStage T1 bladder cancer: grade is the primary determinant for risk of muscle invasion. Tumor characteristics believed to predict for deep muscle invasion after transurethral resection of superficial bladder cancer alone were analyzed in 51 patients with stage T1 (stage A) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. All patients were treated at Stanford University Medical Center and none had intravesical chemotherapy at any time during the median followup of 78 months. No patient had carcinoma in situ. A total of 14 patients (27%) had deep muscle invasion. None of the patients with grade 1, 5 (22%) with grade 2 and 9 (50%) with grade 3 to 4 tumors had deep muscle invasion. Comparison of the risk of muscle invasion using pathological tumor grade at diagnosis, highest grade at any cystoscopic biopsy before the diagnosis of muscle invasion or highest grade at cystoscopic biopsy immediately antecedent to the cystoscopy at which muscle invasion was diagnosed all showed similar probability of muscle invasion. Mean interval to development of muscle invasion was 6 and 12 months in the grades 2 and 3 to 4 groups, respectively. At 36 months the cumulative probability of invasion-free survival was 62% for grade 2, compared to 50% for grades 3 to 4 cancer patients (p less than 0.005, Gehan). Univariate regression analysis demonstrated grade to be the only significant factor in predicting for invasive disease (p = 0.005), with tumors in the bladder neck to be of borderline significance (p = 0.159). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, grade remained the single tumor variable predicting for invasive bladder cancer (p = 0.004). These data suggest that of routinely available data at diagnosis and during subsequent followup cystoscopic examinations, tumor grade is the most important biological predictor of progression to muscle invasive cancer. \nEfficacy of quinine for falciparum malaria according to previous chloroquine exposure. Chloroquine has been reported to antagonise the anti-parasitic action of quinine against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. We looked for evidence of any such antagonism in vivo. In 123 Malawian children with cerebral malaria treated with parenteral quinine, the likelihood of survival and the rate of recovery were much the same in patients who had taken chloroquine and those who had not. In these circumstances we found no evidence of chloroquine/quinine antagonism. \nInfluence of the ultrasonic surgical aspirator on the dura and spinal cord. An electrohistologic study. The influence of the ultrasonic surgical aspirator on the dura and underlying spinal cord was examined. Spinal-cord-evoked potential was simultaneously recorded. In a test of identical time, the degree of influence on the dura, the pia mater, and the spinal cord increased according to the increase of energy of the ultrasonic surgical aspirator. With 60% energy at 20 seconds and 80% energy at both 10 and 20 seconds, spinal-cord-evoked potential showed wave changes. In light of these results, it is suggested that in using the ultrasonic surgical aspirator on the dura, the electrohistologic safety limit be set at 60% energy and the maximum time duration at one point less than 10 seconds. \nIdiopathic trigeminal pain associated with gustatory stimuli. We present a unique case of a patient with facial pain evoked by gustatory stimuli. Pain was typically evoked by application of sucrose to the ipsilateral anterior 2/3 of the tongue, but not to the contralateral aspect. Pain was referred to the maxillary tuberosity area and, when stronger, to the infraorbital and supraorbital regions. Sucrose was most effective in eliciting pain, whilst saline, citric acid and water had a minimal effect. Spatial or temporal summation of gustatory stimuli was associated with stronger pain of longer duration and shorter latency. Some of the pain characteristics were similar to those of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. Thus, pain was elicited by innocuous ipsilateral stimuli, referred out of the stimulus zone, persisted beyond the period of stimulation and could be controlled with carbamazepine. We proposed a central neural mechanism for pain induction with convergence between gustatory stimuli afferents and pain pathways in the trigeminal system. \nHeart rate response to an i.v. test dose of adrenaline and lignocaine with and without atropine pretreatment. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of an adrenaline test dose for detecting intravascular injection and the effect of atropine pretreatment, 90 ASA physical status I and II patients were allocated randomly to two groups, to receive i.v. saline 1 ml (n = 46) or i.v. atropine 0.5 mg (n = 44). Five minutes later, all patients received an i.v. test dose of 2% lignocaine 3 ml with adrenaline 15 micrograms at a rate of 1 ml s-1. The groups were similar with respect to basal heart rate (HR). HR remained unchanged after saline injection, but increased slightly 5 min after atropine injection (mean 78 (SD 15) beat min-1 vs 87 (20) beat min-1 (P less than 0.05). After the test dose of lignocaine with adrenaline, HR increased significantly in both groups at 30 s, 1 and 2 min, and remained increased at 3 min in the atropine group. The maximum increase in HR was greater in the atropine group than in the saline group (31 (4) beat min-1 vs 26 (11) beat min-1 (P less than 0.05). However, when individual maximum HR changes are considered, five patients in the saline group and four in the atropine group had an increase less than or equal to 10 beat min-1, and three patients in the saline group had no change or a decrease in HR. Defining a positive result to a test dose as an increase in HR of greater than 10 beat min-1, the sensitivity of the adrenaline test dose was 83 (5.5)% in the saline group and 91 (3.5)% in the atropine group (ns). \nRadiation therapy for primary carcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary system. An analysis of 63 cases. From 1976 to 1988, 63 patients received radiation therapy for primary cancers of the extrahepatic biliary system (eight gallbladder and 55 extrahepatic biliary duct). Twelve patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. Chemotherapy was administered to 13 patients. Three patients underwent intraluminal brachytherapy alone (range, 28 to 55 Gy). Sixty patients received megavoltage external-beam radiation therapy (range, 5.4 to 61.6 Gy; median, 45 Gy), of whom nine received additional intraluminal brachytherapy (range, 14 to 45 Gy; median, 30 Gy). The median survival of all patients was 7 months. Sixty patients died, all within 39 months of radiation therapy. One patient is alive 11 months after irradiation without surgical resection, and two are alive 50 months after liver transplantation and irradiation. Symptomatic duodenal ulcers developed after radiation therapy in seven patients but were not significantly related to any clinical variable tested. Extrahepatic biliary duct cancers, the absence of metastases, increasing calendar year of treatment, and liver transplantation with postoperative radiation therapy were factors significantly associated with improved survival. \nSpinal cord schistosomiasis. A clinical, laboratory and radiological study, with a note on therapeutic aspects. Fourteen patients with schistosomiasis of the spinal cord are described. They fall into two groups: 7 patients had clinical and computer-assisted myelographic evidence of lesions in the conus medullaris or cauda equina, or both. The clinical picture in the remaining 7 patients was usually that of acute or subacute transverse myelitis with normal or equivocal CT myelographic appearances. Granulomas containing bilharzial ova were found in 2 female patients with conus swelling subjected to laminectomy and biopsy. In 1 of these the ova were identified as S. haematobium while in the second, unidentified bilharzial ova were found. A presumptive diagnosis of spinal cord schistosomiasis was made in the remaining 12 patients based on characteristic clinical and investigative profiles. All 13 patients tested showed evidence of bilharzial infection based on positive blood serology or the detection of bilharzial ova, or both. All but 1 patient showed at least one of the following abnormalities on CSF examination: pleocytosis, an elevated protein content and as indicated by the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands, an elevated IgG index and an increased CSF IgG synthesis rate. A CSF bilharzia enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, developed to indicate the presence of schistosomal infection within the theca, was found to be sensitive although not entirely specific for the diagnosis of spinal cord schistosomiasis. Eleven of the 14 patients showed rapid clinical improvement, 8 after praziquantel and corticosteroid treatment, 2 after operation and 1 spontaneously. Significant reductions in the CSF cell count, protein concentration and bilharzia ELISA titre, and in intrathecal antibody production, occurred following praziquantel and corticosteroid therapy. The CSF sugar level showed a significant rise. A reduction in conus size was observed in 3 patients when CT myelography was repeated after medical therapy. The normalization of most of the laboratory parameters after combined medical treatment with praziquantel and corticosteroids, together with clinical and radiological improvement, strengthened the presumptive diagnosis of cord schistosomiasis and supports the policy of early intensive medical treatment (as opposed to surgical therapy) for this condition when diagnosed on indirect evidence. \nMalignant melanoma in the 1990s: the continued importance of early detection and the role of physician examination and self-examination of the skin. Despite the exciting new techniques being developed to help diagnose early malignant melanoma, the current standard of care remains periodic examination of the skin. The combination of routine physician examination coupled with self-examination of the skin provides an opportunity for the identification of early malignant melanoma. Removal of such thin lesions can significantly reduce the ever-increasing mortality rate from this potentially serious form of cutaneous cancer. \nThe adverse impact of cyclosporine on serum lipids in renal transplant recipients. The extent to which cyclosporine (CsA) directly, or indirectly, influences serum lipid levels in renal transplant patients treated with multiple-drug immunosuppression protocols is unclear. Indeed, patients treated with CsA have reduced corticosteroid requirements, fewer acute rejection episodes, and other differences from patients receiving conventional immunosuppression that may reduce serum lipid levels. We studied patients treated with low-dose CsA, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and Minnesota antilymphocyte globulin ([ALG] n = 205) versus conventional (three-drug) immunosuppression (n = 368) and evaluated the impact of CsA, acute rejection episodes, and other clinical parameters on serum lipids. Fasting serum lipid levels from stable patients transplanted between 1976 to 1989 were studied at 3 (n = 573), 12 (n = 565), 26 (n = 55), and 52 (n = 521) weeks posttransplant using multivariate, linear regression analysis. The incidence of acute rejection episodes was reduced by CsA, but patients with fewer acute rejection episodes in the early posttransplant period had higher serum total cholesterol (increased by .33 +/- .12 mmol/L [13 +/- 5 mg/dL] and .27 +/- .12 mmol/L [10 +/- 5 mg/dL], P less than 0.05, at 3 and 12 weeks, respectively) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (increased by .23 +/- .11 mmol/L [9 +/- 4 mg/dL] and .23 +/- .11 mmol/L [9 +/- 4 mg/dL], P less than 0.05). \nSquamous metaplasia in hormonally treated prostatic cancer. Significance during follow-up. A prospective study of 59 hormonally treated prostatic cancer cases was undertaken during follow-up with sequential transrectal palpation and fine-needle aspiration. At initiation of therapy patients' ages ranged from forty-eight to eighty-two years (median, 68 years). The usual follow-up interval was 6 +/- 3 months, and follow-up periods ranged from six months to one hundred twenty months (median 48 months). The cytologic findings were categorized under four cytologic response types and palpation findings under five response grades. Four different degrees of squamous metaplasia (1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) were observed in smears, depending on semiquantitative determination of squamous metaplastic cells in relation to the total amount of benign and malignant epithelial cells in the smear. There were 341 follow-up observations in which both transrectal fine-needle aspiration cytology and palpation were done. In 306 of these, cytologic findings were found to be adequate. Comparison of squamous metaplasia with cytologic response types revealed a highly significant difference between the benign state and recurrence/frank malignancy. This was also true when frequency of squamous metaplasia was compared with palpatory response grades. It was found that squamous metaplasia can be a valuable adjunct to other cytomorphologic changes such as shrinkage of tumor cell size and decrease in size of nucleoli or its disappearance, in determining response to hormonal therapy. \nEffects of lipoprotein (a) on success rate of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] and plasminogen share a high degree of homology as recently evidenced by amino acid and deoxyribonucleic acid analysis. As Lp(a) is enzymatically inactive, it has been suggested that high levels of Lp(a) may suppress the profibrinolytic activity at the cell surface and increase the risk for arteriosclerosis and thrombosis by competitive inhibition of plasminogen. The present study evaluated whether high levels of Lp(a) influence thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Forty-one patients with acute myocardial infarction received a combination low-dose thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and human single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA). This regimen did not induce plasminemia or a lytic state as indicated by well-maintained levels of fibrinogen. Coronary patency was assessed angiographically 90 minutes after initiation of treatment. Thrombolysis was successful in 30 and unsuccessful in 11 patients. Patients with high Lp(a) levels (greater than or equal to 25 mg/dl) (n = 9) responded equally well to thrombolytic therapy (8 of 9, patency 89%) as did patients with normal or low levels of Lp(a) (22 of 32, patency 70%, difference greater than 0.1). Lp(a) levels did not differ significantly between patients with successful and unsuccessful thrombolysis. Our results demonstrate that high levels of Lp(a) do not affect thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction when low-dose pharmacologic concentrations of rt-PA and scu-PA are applied in combination. \nMechanism of cyclosporine-induced hypertension. Cyclosporine is a common immunosuppressive agent used in solid organ and bone marrow transplants and the treatment of some immunological diseases. It has been established that treatment with cyclosporine can cause a patient to develop hypertension within a few weeks of treatment. This review will examine this effect and effective ways to treat it. \nA five-year appraisal and hemodynamic evaluation of the Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valve. Two hundred forty-four Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valves were implanted in 225 consecutive patients from October 1983 to December 1988. Aortic valve replacement was performed in 90 patients, mitral valve replacement in 118, and double valve replacement in 16 patients. One patient had tricuspid valve replacement. There were 100 female patients and 125 male patients with a mean age of 54 years (range 2 to 71 years). Present data were completely available for all patients. The cumulative follow-up was 541 patient-years with a mean of 2 years, 5 months. The closing date for follow-up was July 1989, and the closing interval was 2 months. The early mortality rate was 3.1%, and the late mortality rate, 3.1%. The 5-year survival rate was 88% +/- 2.0%: 87% +/- 3.0% for aortic valve replacement, 91% +/- 3.3% for mitral valve replacement, and 75% +/- 9.6% for double valve replacement. The actuarial rates of freedom from thromboembolism at 5 years were 93% +/- 3.2% for aortic, 96% +/- 1.4% for mitral, and 94% +/- 6.1% for double valve replacement. There were no instances of structural valve deterioration. Actuarial rate of freedom from valve-related morbidity and mortality was 86% +/- 2.0% at 5 years: 86% +/- 9.5% for aortic, 87% +/- 3.3% for mitral, and 75% +/- 7.3% for double valve replacement. Effective valve areas (average) of 12 mitral and 12 aortic valve prostheses were calculated at rest and during bicycle exercise: 2.4 cm2 at rest and 2.8 cm2 during exercise in 27 mm aortic valves, 2.4 cm2 at rest and 3.0 cm2 during exercise in 25 mm aortic valves, 2.0 cm2 at rest and 2.4 cm2 during exercise in 27 mm mitral valves, and 2.6 cm2 at rest and 2.5 cm2 during exercise in 29 mm mitral valve. On the basis of our follow-up period of 5 years, we have judged the Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valve reliable, with a low incidence of valve-related morbidity and with acceptably satisfactory hemodynamic characteristics at rest and during exercise. \nReduction in susceptibility to natural killer cell-mediated lysis of human FO-1 melanoma cells after induction of HLA class I antigen expression by transfection with B2m gene. Induction of HLA class I antigens on cultured melanoma cells FO-1 after transfection with a human or a mouse B2m gene was associated with a statistically significant reduction in their susceptibility to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis. These results indicate that the structural differences between human and mouse beta 2-mu do not abolish the ability of the HLA class I molecular complex to modulate NK cell-mediated lysis of melanoma cells FO-1. The role of HLA class I antigens in the phenomenon is corroborated by the ability of anti-HLA class I MAb to enhance, although to a different extent, the susceptibility of transfected FO-1 cells to NK cell-mediated lysis. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) significantly reduced the susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis of transfected FO-1 cells. Surprisingly, TNF-alpha reduced the extent of lysis more than IFN-gamma, although the latter cytokine enhanced HLA class I antigen expression more than the former one. This finding, in conjunction with a reduction in the susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis of untransfected FO-1 cells incubated with IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha, suggests that the two cytokines reduce NK cell-mediated lysis of transfected cells by modulating not only the expression of HLA class I antigens, but also that of other structures. Induction of HLA class I antigens and their modulation with IFN-gamma did not affect the susceptibility to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell-mediated lysis of transfected FO-1 cells. Characterization of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying abnormalities in HLA class I antigen expression by melanoma cells and of the role of these molecules in the interactions of melanoma cells with various types of effector cells may suggest novel immunotherapeutic approaches to melanoma. \nEvaluation and management of stridor in the newborn. Stridor in a newborn should necessitate an immediate work-up to rule out a life-threatening airway obstruction. Three cases of newborns with stridor are presented. These cases emphasize the need for an immediate and thorough physical examination of any stridorous newborn, followed by radiologic studies and direct laryngoscopy. While other invasive procedures are frequently required for a precise diagnosis, a careful examination with special attention to the quality of the stridor often permits a more effective diagnostic approach in an atmosphere of appropriate urgency. \nComparative evaluation of loracarbef and amoxicillin-clavulanate for acute otitis media. One hundred five infants and children with acute otitis media were randomized to therapy with loracarbef, an experimental carbacephem antibiotic, or amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin), an approved drug for this disease. Ninety-two were evaluable (46 in each group). Middle ear fluid samples obtained for culture before therapy grew Haemophilus spp. in 30% of cases, pneumococci in 29% of cases, and Moraxella catarrhalis in 15% of cases. beta-Lactamase-producing bacteria were found in 37% of patients. Clinical failure occurred in four loracarbef-treated patients and one amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patient (P = 0.361). Recurrence of acute otitis media was more common in the 2 to 3 weeks after loracarbef treatment (eight patients) than it was after amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy (three patients), but not significantly so (P = 0.197). Thus, combined failure and recurrence occurred in 12 loracarbef-treated patients and four amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patients (P = 0.052). Gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 13 loracarbef-treated and 21 amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patients (P = 0.13). Diaper rash was more common with amoxicillin-clavulanate (22 patients) than with loracarbef (10 patients; P = 0.016). Satisfactory results were achieved with both antibiotics, and adverse effects, although common, were minor. \nPsychosocial aspects of chronic, clinically unconfirmed vulvovaginitis Women with chronic symptoms of vulvovaginitis referred to a university vulvovaginitis clinic were assessed on psychological and social (including sexual) variables to determine whether differences existed among women with unconfirmed vulvovaginitis, women with confirmed vulvovaginitis, and healthy controls. Eighty-three consecutive women with chronic symptoms of vulvovaginitis and 32 asymptomatic control women completed clinical examinations, cultures, and the following psychological tests or questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, a sexual behavior and response questionnaire (Campion), and a study questionnaire. Statistical analyses (chi 2 and analysis of variance) were performed on the confirmed and unconfirmed vulvovaginitis and control groups of women. Women with confirmed and unconfirmed vulvovaginitis scored higher than control women on several psychological variables, but women with unconfirmed vulvovaginitis were found to be significantly more emotionally distressed on psychological tests and to report more discomfort during sexual intercourse than both women with confirmed vulvovaginitis and healthy controls. Psychosocial inquiry is important in the clinical assessment and management of such women. \nThe role of radical surgery in the management of radiation recurrent and large volume prostate cancer. Twenty-two patients seen between 1975 and 1988 were analyzed who had surgical attempts to cure locally advanced prostate cancer by exenterative procedures or salvage surgery for radiation recurrent disease. Twelve patients (Group I) underwent either a salvage cystoprostatectomy or perineal prostatectomy for radiorecurrent disease, including three patients with a Kock continent urinary diversion done in combination with the salvage operation. Five of the 12 (41.7%) recurrent disease confined to the surgical specimen and 11 of 12 (91.7%) are alive at a mean follow-up of 49 months, including four patients (25%) with a completely negative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value (less than 0.2 ng/dl). All perineal prostatectomy patients are continent, and two of the three Kock pouch patients are continent. Ten of the 22 patients (Group II) had a cystoprostatectomy or exenteration for locally advanced disease that the surgeon did not think was amenable to standard radical prostatectomy. Only one of these ten patients had negative surgical margins, capsule, and seminal vesicles. Nine are alive (although only one patient has no evidence of disease) at a mean follow-up of 59 months. Morbidity was substantial with a 50% major complication rate including four patients requiring reoperation because of bleeding, abscess, bowel obstruction, or colostomy closure. Salvage procedures for radiorecurrent disease can be done safely, even with the inclusion of a continent diversion, and may be curative or provide survival benefit to carefully selected patients. Cystoprostatectomy or exenteration for locally advanced disease does not appear to be a curative endeavor for most patients and may be accompanied by significant morbidity. \nDrug-induced modification of vascular structure: effects of antihypertensive drugs. It has long been realized that hypertension causes alterations in the peripheral vasculature, with the arterial wall becoming thicker and the lumen relatively smaller. This is particularly true in small resistance arteries, but larger vessels are also affected. The precise mechanisms remain to be determined, although it is highly likely that growth-promoting autacoids are involved as well as mechanical forces. Numerous studies of hypertension in animal models and a few in hypertensive humans have tried to establish the reversibility of these changes after successful lowering of blood pressure. Too few data are available to form firm conclusions, but thiazides and hydralazine-like vasodilators appear to have only a minimal effect on the vasculature. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are clearly effective, and alpha-blockers may be active. However, it is difficult to derive even tentative conclusions from the available information on calcium antagonists and beta-blockers. These results are discussed in the context of future therapeutic and investigative approaches. \nCorrelation between sexual abuse and somatization in women with somatic and nonsomatic chronic pelvic pain. After a comprehensive clinical and psychological evaluation, 99 women with pelvic pain of at least 6 months' duration and normal findings at laparoscopy were divided into two groups, including 47 women with probable somatic causes of pain (group 1) and 52 women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2). Women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2) were younger, had higher mean somatization scores, and reported an earlier mean age at first intercourse, a higher number of total sexual partners, and a higher prevalence of sexual abuse before the age of 20. Within group 2 (nonsomatic pain) but not within group 1, mean somatization scores were significantly higher among women with a history of sexual abuse than among women with a negative history. When analyzed as risks for nonsomatic pelvic pain, the positive predictive value of both a history of sexual abuse and a high somatization score was 78% (relative risk compared with that of women with zero or one risk factor, 2.1; p less than 0.0001). These data suggest that the psychosocial profile of women with nonsomatic pelvic pain differs from that of women with somatic pelvic pain and that previous sexual abuse is a significant predisposing risk for somatization and non-somatic chronic pelvic pain. \nRestenosis 1 to 24 months after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty: a necropsy study of 20 patients. This report describes clinical, morphologic and histologic findings at necropsy late (range 1.6 to 24.1 months [average 8.2 months]) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty in 20 patients with coronary angioplasty restenosis. Clinical evidence of restenosis occurred in 14 patients (70%), including 6 patients with sudden coronary death. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) had a cardiac cause of death and 6 (30%) had a noncardiac cause of death. Two major subgroups of histologic findings were observed: 1) intimal proliferation (60%), and 2) atherosclerotic plaque only (40%). Of the eight sites with atherosclerotic plaque only, six were eccentric lesions and two were concentric lesions. No morphologic evidence of previous angioplasty injury (cracks, breaks, tears) was observed in the eight patients with atherosclerotic plaque only. Proposed mechanisms for the development of intimal proliferation involve the reaction of smooth muscle cells and platelets, whereas elastic recoil of overstretched eccentric or concentric atherosclerotic lesions represents the most likely explanation for the findings in the latter subgroup. On the basis of these morphologic findings at angioplasty restenosis sites, specific treatment strategies for restenosis after coronary artery balloon angioplasty are proposed. \nAcute postinfarction septal rupture: long-term results. From 1973 to 1989, 66 patients received early surgical repair for acute postinfarction ventricular septal rupture. Mean age was 64 +/- 7 years (range, 45 to 80 years). Ventricular septal rupture occurred soon after acute myocardial infarction (3.4 +/- 4 days), and the first medical treatment occurred 6.7 +/- 7 days after onset of acute myocardial infarction. Three patients had a previous myocardial infarction. The site of the rupture was anterior in 38 patients (57%) and posterior in 28 (43%). Forty-four patients (67%) were in shock at the time of admission. Intraaortic balloon pumping was used preoperatively in 28. Operation was performed at the time of maximal efficacy of medical treatment. The same technique was used in all cases. Associated procedures included coronary bypass grafting in 5 patients and valvar operation in 5. The patients have been carefully followed up for up to 16 years. Hospital mortality was 45% (30 patients) and was cardiac related or due to acute renal failure in 25 patients (83%). No correlation could be revealed between early death and age, sex, preoperative intraaortic balloon pumping, or year of operation. Location of the ventricular septal rupture (early mortality of 57% for posterior versus 37% for anterior ventricular septal rupture) and shock at the time of admission (52% versus 32%) showed a trend toward significance (0.08 less than or equal to p less than 0.10). Response to initial active therapy has a strong predictive value (mortality of 70% in unresponsive patients versus 14% in responders; p less than 0.001). \nAcute traumatic cervical epidural hematoma from a stab wound. Cervical spinal epidural hematoma is an infrequent entity that usually requires emergency decompressive therapy because of rapid neurologic dysfunction. We present the case of a 34-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with minimal symptomatology after a stab wound to the neck. A computed tomography myelogram of the cervical spine revealed a cervical spinal epidural hematoma. This case illustrates an unusual presentation as well as etiology of cervical spinal epidural hematoma. \nGastric duplication cyst. Endoscopic presentation as an ulcerated antral mass. A case of a 53-year-old man who presented with epigastric pain and weight loss is described. Endoscopy showed a smooth antral mass with what appeared to be a central overlying ulcer. Computerized tomography and upper gastrointestinal series confirmed the presence of a gastric mass. Laparotomy and local resection showed a gastric duplication comprised of two cysts, one with communication to the stomach lumen. Gastric duplication is a rare entity, especially in the adult. Though generally benign, local ulceration or fistula formation can cause symptoms and may suggest a more malignant process that warrants investigation. \nBiomechanics of fixation systems to the cervical spine. The biomechanical evaluation of a cervical spine implant must include flexural and torsional testing if it is used for stabilizing a traumatic unstable motion segment. A cadaveric model is presented that allows flexural and torsional testing of a cervical spine motion segment, measuring the tilting angle, the translation, and the torsional angle. After measuring the intact segments, in the first series, a so-called posterior instability was created and stabilized posteriorly with the hook-plate and sublaminar wiring; anteriorly with the H-plate; and with combinations of these implants. In a second series, their stabilizing effect after complete discoligamentous instability was tested. With isolated posterior instability, it was found that the flexural stability is preserved, whereas torsional stability is markedly reduced. In cases of isolated posterior instability, only hook plating alone or its combination with anterior H-plating seemed to bring about a higher torsional stability than the intact specimen. In cases of complete discoligamentous instability, only anterior H-plate and posterior hook plate procedures combined or the hook plate alone was able to guarantee both torsional and flexural stability higher than the intact spine. Exclusive posterior wiring without postoperative external immobilization in complete discoligamentous instability may result in permanent subluxation of the functional unit. Exclusive anterior H-plate fixation in complete discoligamentous instability requires additional external immobilization in the postoperative phase to prevent flexion and torsion. \nPostoperative vasospasm after antegrade mesenteric revascularization: a report of three cases. Vascular reconstruction for chronic intestinal ischemia can be accomplished by endarterectomy or aortomesenteric bypass. In our practice, antegrade bypasses from the supraceliac aorta to the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are currently the most frequently used techniques. Such reconstructions often use multiple or bifurcated large diameter vascular prostheses and have demonstrated excellent long-term patency. Despite these salutory results, we have noted an unusual perioperative response in three of these patients, which is the subject of this report. All three patients underwent uncomplicated elective mesenteric revascularization with grafts (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) originating in the supraceliac aorta. Indications for operation included (1) history of postprandial pain, (2) documentation of weight loss, and (3) angiographic evidence of advanced atherosclerotic disease with appropriate collateral development. Episodes of abdominal pain occurred 5 to 20 days after operation when normal food intake was reinstituted. In two patients immediate angiograms revealed patent grafts with diffuse mesenteric vasospasm. Treatment with intravenous hyperalimentation and nifedipine for 10 days resulted in complete resolution of symptoms. In the third patient, symptoms were totally relieved by temporary reduction in oral intake and administration of nifedipine. A later angiogram revealed a patent graft. All patients have remained asymptomatic and regained normal weight. This pattern of postrevascularization pain has not been seen in our patients undergoing revascularization with small (i.e., venous) conduits originating in the infrarenal aorta. The cause appears to be a heightened myogenic response of a \"protected\" vascular bed when suddenly exposed to the high perfusion pressure and blood flow of large caliber antegrade conduits. Prophylaxis with calcium channel blockers and use of smaller diameter grafts (5 mm) may avoid this disturbing syndrome. \nImmunohistological diagnosis of \"plasmacytoid T cell lymphoma\" in paraffin wax sections. An immunohistological study of paraffin wax embedded tissue from three cases of plasmacytoid monocyte neoplasms, using a panel of antibodies which react with fixation resistant leucocyte markers, is reported. This neoplasm was found to have a distinctive antigenic profile, being negative for CD3 and elastase, but positive for CD43 and CD68. This immunological phenotype, coupled with its characteristic morphological features, should facilitate the recognition of this rare neoplasm in routinely processed tissue. Furthermore, the term \"plasmacytoid monocyte sarcoma\" is proposed to designate it because it is inappropriate to refer to it as a lymphoma. As all cases have been associated with a myeloproliferative disorder (usually an acute or chronic myeloid leukaemia), these tumours probably represent the accumulation in lymphoid tissue of neoplastic cells which have differentiated along the plasmacytoid monocyte pathway. \nMigraine--why and how a cortical excitatory wave may initiate the aura and headache. A large number of clinical and neurophysiological observations are reviewed that clearly indicate that the symptoms of migraine aura result from a spread of an excitatory wave along the cortex from a primary focus. This excitation may start as a consequence of information overload to a low threshold cortical area. The transient neuronal excitation is followed by a long-lasting period of reduced cortical flow, which involves a substantial component of active constriction of resistance vessels, even persisting for several hours during the headache phase. When the excitatory wave has reached and activated free pain fiber endings in sufficiently many cortical vessels, off-branching peripheral motor endings of these fibers may become activated via axon reflexes. These motor endings may be located in cortical microvessels or in small vessels around large dural vessels. This leads to a neurogenic inflammation in the vessel walls, experienced as headache by the sufferer. The wall of dural sinuses offers a rational explanation for the beneficial effect of most medications used in migraine. \nPelvic denervation for chronic pain associated with endometriosis: fact or fancy? The efficacy of presacral neurectomy and amputation of the uterosacral ligaments in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain has been debated for decades. These procedures used to be done mainly in women with normal pelves, but more recently they have been performed during conservative surgery for treatment of endometriosis. In the 1980s the rapid spread of laparoscopic surgery has led to an increasing number of endoscopic denervations in patients with chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. However, an analysis of literature data has failed to prove that presacral neurectomy and amputation of the uterosacral ligaments are effective and did not demonstrate better results with the use of lasers rather than electrocoagulation. Moreover, no valid comparison has yet been made between laparotomy and laparoscopic methods. \nA phase II study of days 1 and 8 cisplatin and recombinant alpha-2B interferon in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Preclinical data from studies of human lung cancer xenografts suggest that the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin are enhanced by alpha-interferon. To verify the above observations, the authors initiated a Phase II trial in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cisplatin was given at 100 mg/m2 during a 28-day cycle in a divided day 1 and day 8 schedule. Starting on day 1, alpha-2B interferon was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 5 million units three times a week continuously for a minimum of 2 months. Between January 1989 and September 1989, 30 patients were evaluated for response and toxicity. According to the staging system proposed by Mountain, 20 patients had Stage IV disease, 7 had Stage IIIB disease, and 3 had Stage IIIA disease. Expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Leu-7 was immunohistochemically investigated to evaluate possible relationship to treatment response. The response rate was 13.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2% to 25%). The four responders showed positivity for NSE, and two of them were positive for Leu-7. An average of three cycles was given. The mean dose intensity administered was 83% of the projected dose for cisplatin and 92% of the projected dose for alpha-2B interferon. A standard scale was used to assess interferon toxicity. Hematologic, renal, and systemic side effects were not significant. In advanced NSCLC the addition of alpha-2B interferon did not increase the cisplatin-induced response rate. Further studies should be performed to determine the real value of chemotherapy response in tumors showing positive immunoreactivity for neural markers such as NSE and Leu-7. \nGastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. Fifty-five patients were evaluated and treated for gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid tumors at our institution from 1968 through 1988. Thirty patients had primary tumors smaller than 1 cm and were treated surgically or endoscopically by local excision, whereas 25 underwent resection with regional lymphadenectomy for larger primaries. At the time of initial treatment 17 patients demonstrated metastasis. Although 13 of these patients had primary tumors larger than 2 cm, in four patients with ileal carcinoids, the primary measured 0.8 to 1.5 cm. Serosal involvement was present in nine of 17 patients with metastasis. With a follow-up range of 3 months to 20 years, six patients have died with metastatic carcinoid tumor, two patients died without evidence of disease, 12 patients are alive with metastasis, and 35 patients are alive, free of disease. In this series three determinants for risk of metastasis in GI carcinoid tumors were evident: primary size, serosal penetration, and primary site in the small intestine. In patients with any of these risk factors, resection with regional lymphadenectomy is recommended. \nAdrenocorticotropic hormone-independent bilateral adrenocortical macronodular hyperplasia as a distinct subtype of Cushing's syndrome. Enzyme histochemical and ultrastructural study of four cases with a review of the literature. Four patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent bilateral adrenocortical macronodular hyperplasia (AIMAH) were examined. All of them were men whose ages ranged from 37 to 52 years. Plasma cortisol levels were high, with a loss of diurnal rhythmicity, and plasma ACTH was undetectable. Adrenal cortisol secretion was not suppressed by dexamethasone, but it was ACTH responsive. Test results for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) also were negative. Image analyses revealed a normal sella turcica and significantly enlarged adrenal glands, which showed enhanced uptake of isotope. Both adrenal glands in all cases were between 72 and 176 g in combined weight and were composed of, and distorted by, yellow nodules. Histologically, small cortical cells with or without lipid, occasional clear cells, and rare compact cells of the usual size were increased in number in the glandular cords. Enzyme histochemically, cortical cells showed weaker activity for 3 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and other enzymes than did usual cortisol-producing adenomas. Ultrastructurally, they had moderately to poorly developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Nonnodular areas of the cortex consisting of nonproliferating cells were atrophic and contained no compact cell zone. This is similar to the adrenal cortices attached to cortisol-producing adenomas. These features are unique to AIMAH and suggest the presence of a distinct subtype of Cushing's syndrome. \nDiagnosis and monitoring of subarachnoid hemorrhage by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Thirty-six patients with acute spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (26 caused by rupture of an aneurysm) were examined by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography by using a 2.25-MHz ultrasound transducer. In 20 of these 26 patients (76%), the aneurysm could be identified by a characteristic abnormal blood flow pattern within the aneurysm in coronal and axial scanning planes by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Blood within the basal cisterns, on top of the tentorium, and within the ventricles and parenchyma was sonographically detected by increased echodensity in 75%. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbances and cerebral vasospasm were detected in two-dimensional B-mode images in 85% and 100%, respectively. In Doppler mode, intravascular blood flow velocity could be quantified. We conclude that transcranial color-coded real-time sonography, a new, noninvasive method for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, allows detection of the primary vascular lesion and monitoring of complications. \nCorrelates of postural hypotension in a community sample of elderly blacks and whites. Postural hypotension is thought to be prevalent among the elderly, but few community-based studies of this condition have been conducted. In addition, little is known about postural hypotension in blacks despite well documented racial differences in hypertension and stroke. Data on 659 elderly (greater than or equal to 60 years of age) participants in a survey of two rural, biracial townships were analyzed to describe the frequency and correlates of postural hypotension. Twelve percent of the 659 adults experienced a drop of 10 mmHg or greater in systolic blood pressure on going from sitting to standing (supine measures were not available). This degree of postural hypotension was twice as common for whites as for blacks (14.5% vs 7.5%, P = 0.01). Postural hypotension was associated with elevated sitting blood pressure and showed positive but statistically non-significant relationships with anti-hypertensive medications and leanness. The association between race and postural hypotension persisted after adjusting for these and other risk factors (OR = 2.2, 95% CI:1.2,4.0). \nGall stone disease in African patients with sickle cell anaemia: a preliminary report from Yaounde, Cameroon. Cholecystosonography was undertaken in 90 patients with sickle cell disease aged 15 years and over. Gall stones were found in 26 (28.9%) patients. There was no sex difference, but the incidence increased with age from 13.2% at under 20 years to 75% at 30 years and over. The mean serum cholesterol and total and unconjugated bilirubin concentrations were not significantly different between patients with and without gall stones. As most (80.8%) stones were radiolucent they were probably of pigment type, containing little or no calcium, and further investigation into how they are produced is needed. Sickle cell patients with acute abdominal crisis should have gall bladder disease excluded before a diagnosis of vascular crisis is made. \nCoronary heart disease risk factor profiles in black patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: paradoxic patterns. PURPOSE: Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in black Americans consists of two variants: one with insulin resistance and one with normal insulin sensitivity. This study examined whether cardiovascular disease risk factors are significantly different between the two variants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two black patients with NIDDM in near-normoglycemic remission who were receiving no pharmacologic therapy for NIDDM were evaluated for insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic insulin clamp, plasma insulin levels, degree of obesity, glucose metabolism, serum total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and fasting plasma triglyceride levels. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of these patients had normal insulin sensitivity (glucose disposal rate in response to a 1 mU.kg-1.minute-1 insulin infusion greater than 6.0 mg.kg-1.minute-1). The insulin-sensitive patients were less obese (body mass index [BMI] 26.5 +/- 0.6 versus 30.8 +/- 0.9 kg/m2) and had lower fasting plasma insulin levels (56.9 +/- 7.8 versus 88.0 +/- 6.0 pmol/L), lower serum cholesterol (4.47 +/- 0.30 versus 6.39 +/- 0.26 mmol/L), lower serum LDL cholesterol (2.77 +/- 0.31 versus 4.51 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and lower fasting plasma triglyceride levels (0.83 +/- 0.08 versus 1.45 +/- 0.16 mmol/L) than the insulin-resistant patients. Serum HDL cholesterol was not different between the two groups and was in the high-normal range (1.31 +/- 0.08 and 1.19 +/- 0.07 mmol/L). Univariate analysis demonstrated that serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and fasting plasma triglycerides were highly correlated with insulin-mediated glucose disposal and fasting plasma insulin. The differences in insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles were independent of obesity, as they were present in six insulin-resistant and six insulin-sensitive patients matched for BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Black patients with the insulin-sensitive variant of NIDDM have a low risk factor profile for cardiovascular disease as compared with those with the insulin-resistant variant, who have a high risk factor profile. A high prevalence of the insulin-sensitive variant of NIDDM in the black population might explain the lower prevalence of angina and myocardial infarction in black patients with NIDDM as compared with white patients with NIDDM. \nDecreased adherence of interleukin 6-treated breast carcinoma cells can lead to separation from neighbors after mitosis. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, but increase the motility, of wild-type ZR-75-1 human ductal breast carcinoma cells, a line of cells that resemble closely the malignant cells cultured from the ascitic effusion. IL-6-treated cells lose their epithelial character, become stellate or fusiform in shape, and migrate away from neighbors. In the wild-type ZR-75-1 cells, IL-6 causes cell-cell separation in preformed colonies as well as postmitotically. We have now investigated the action of IL-6 in clone B ZR-75-1 cells, which are morphologically distinct from wild-type ZR-75-1 cells. In the more polygonal rather than cuboidal clone B cells, IL-6 did not cause early inhibition of DNA synthesis and it caused little cell-cell separation in preformed colonies. However, IL-6 treatment markedly prolonged the interval between mitosis and readherence of daughter cells to their neighbors and the substratum. Supernatants from IL-6-treated cultures contained detached viable cells in increased numbers. Intermitotic intervals were prolonged in IL-6-treated cultures. IL-6-treated dividing breast carcinoma cells are characterized by an increased probability of separation from neighbors and the substratum. \nVisual function in patients undergoing long-term total parenteral nutrition. To evaluate the effects of long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on eye function, 27 adults and 12 children in the UCLA Home TPN Clinic underwent ophthalmoscopic examination and visual-function testing.
