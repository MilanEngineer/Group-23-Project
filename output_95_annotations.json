        "text": "t significantly different. In rats receiving a single oral dose of clonidine (600 micrograms/kg) 10 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg), measured 2 to 3 hr after clonidine administration, was significantly lower than in the placebo group. Mesenteric-systemic shunts (83% +/- 8%), however, were not significantly different from the placebo group. In addition, 18 to 24 hr after a single dose of clonidine, hemodynamic values returned to basal conditions. We also demonstrated that chronic clonidine administration begun before portal vein stenosis can reduce the initial increase in portal pressure after this procedure. We concluded that early chronic clonidine administration reduces the severity of portal hypertension and the development of portosystemic shunts in portal vein-stenosed rats. \nExtramedullary blast crisis in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Demonstration of T-cell lineage and Philadelphia chromosome in a paraspinal tumor. A case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with penetrance of the Ph1 molecular alteration into the T-cell lineage of a paraspinal tumor is reported. The T-cell nature of the paraspinal tumor was documented by immunochemical study and genotyping. The Philadelphia chromosome was also detected by genotyping in the same tumor cell population. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of extramedullary T-cell blast crisis in CML demonstrated in an extranodal tumor. The clinical significance of detecting extramedullary blast crisis, and the theories for the scarcity of T-cell transformation in CML are discussed. \nAn unknown syndrome of nose deformity, oxycephaly, aplasia of the nasolacrimal ducts, and symmetrical cyst formation on the upper lip in siblings: craniorhiny. An unknown syndrome of oxycephaly, nose deformity, hair growth on the skin at the base of the nose, symmetrical cyst formation on the upper lip, and aplasia of the nasolacrimal ducts in a mother and her three children is presented. This syndrome showed autosomal dominant inheritance. All three children were operated on. Oxycephaly and lip deformity in two of the children and hypertelorism that existed in addition to the other anomalies in the third were all corrected. All corrective surgery was performed during a single session for each child. \nPhrenic nerve injury in infants and children undergoing cardiac surgery. Fifty infants and 50 children less than 15 years undergoing palliative or corrective cardiac surgery in the Brompton Hospital between March and October 1988 had direct percutaneous stimulation of the phrenic nerve before and after operation. Ten patients, six under 1 year of age and four over, developed unilateral phrenic nerve injury. In those aged less than 1 year recovery after operation was prolonged because their diaphragmatic palsy made it difficult to wean them from the ventilator. Older children had symptoms but their rate of recovery did not seem to be affected by the phrenic nerve injury. Phrenic nerve damage was no more frequent after a lateral thoracotomy than after a median sternotomy. There was no significant association with the type of operation performed, the experience of the surgeon, the use of bypass or topical ice, the duration of bypass, circulatory arrest or aortic cross clamping, or the age of the patient at the time of operation. In patients who had cardiopulmonary bypass the risk of injury was significantly higher in those who had undergone previous operation. The 10% frequency of phrenic nerve injury determined in this prospective study was higher than that seen in earlier retrospective reports. Direct percutaneous stimulation of the phrenic nerve can be used at the bedside in infants and children to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of phrenic nerve palsy, and the results may influence early management. \nBenefits of monitoring plasma levodopa in Parkinson's disease patients with drug-induced chorea. We studied the temporal patterns of chorea and plasma levodopa profiles in 30 patients with Parkinson's disease whose motor fluctuations were difficult to characterize and treat on the basis of observation alone. We were able to determine whether chorea was associated with high levodopa concentrations or low levodopa concentrations or both. We found the following patterns of levodopa-associated chorea: chorea due to inadequate levodopa levels, chorea due to biphasic levodopa absorption, chorea associated with either rapid or slow levodopa absorption, and chorea due to long-duration levodopa absorption mimicking a sustained-release preparation. Seven patients benefited after their dosing schedules were rearranged as a result of information gained from monitoring. We conclude that any patient with levodopa-associated chorea who cannot be regulated on the basis of observation alone should be studied with simultaneous plasma levodopa measurements and clinical monitoring to detect an unusual plasma levodopa pattern that may be improved by adjustment of dosing schedule. \nAcute nonhemodynamic pulmonary edema with nifedipine in primary pulmonary hypertension. A 34-year-old man with primary pulmonary hypertension developed acute nonhemodynamic pulmonary edema after a loading dose of nifedipine. Changes of the vascular permeability induced by the drug acting on the arteriolar wall of the capillary system could be an explanation. \nMeasurement of individual plasma angiotensins in normal pregnancy and pregnancy-induced hypertension. Individual angiotensin peptides were measured by a high pressure liquid chromatography-RIA (HPLC-RIA) technique in the plasma of 20 nonpregnant women, 17 women with normal pregnancy, and 49 with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Immunoreactive angiotensin-II (ANG-II) consisted mainly of ANG-(1-8) octapeptide (greater than 65%), variable proportions (15-25%) of ANG-(4-8) pentapeptide, and small to negligible proportions of ANG-(2-8) heptapeptide and ANG-(3-8) hexapeptide. Levels of ANG-(1-8) were significantly higher in women with normal pregnancy than in both nonpregnant women (P less than 0.0006) and women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (P less than 0.008); in the latter, levels were lower with increasing severity of disease. Levels of ANG-(4-8) were higher in women with normal pregnancy than in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension or nonpregnant women. When expressed as a proportion of ANG-(1-8) levels, however, ANG-(4-8) levels were not higher in normal pregnancy than in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension or nonpregnant women. It is concluded that the well known increase in ANG-II levels in normal pregnancy relates predominantly to the active ANG-(1-8) octapeptide and to a far lesser extent to the smaller ANG peptides. Similarly, lower ANG-II levels in pregnancy-induced hypertension relate predominantly to lower ANG-(1-8) levels. \nAbnormal most-rapid isometric contractions in patients with Parkinson's disease. Fast isometric elbow flexor muscle contractions of specified amplitude in six normal subjects were compared with those of 11 patients with Parkinson's disease. Despite treatment, all patients exhibited deficits in this motor task. Three patients were able to produce rapid force pulses with normal contraction times, but the variability of their force responses was increased in comparison with the highly stereotyped responses produced by normal subjects. The other eight patients had prolonged contraction times and segmentation of the force profiles. The integrated area of the first agonist EMG burst and the rate of development of force (dF/dt) were less at any target level than what was needed to produce a fast response. The area of the EMG burst, however, did increase with target amplitude, and the relative increase of dF/dt, with target amplitude, was normal. It is concluded that the motor program subserving fast muscle contraction is preserved in Parkinson's disease, but its execution is characterised by improper scaling of motor output. \nDental chair apoplexy. We have reported two cases of intracranial bleeding shortly after a dental procedure. We argue that administration of hypochlorite in gum debridement, application of dental cement, or mechanical stimulation of the alveolar branches of the trigeminal nerve at the pulp may not only result in acute systemic hypertension, but also in the release of vasodilatory neurotransmitters. The combination of a local increase in intracerebral blood flow and simultaneously developing systemic hypertension in an occasional patient may lead to intracranial hemorrhage. \nEpidemiological evidence of the association between lichen planus and two immune-related diseases. Alopecia areata and ulcerative colitis. Gruppo Italiano Studi Epidemiologici in Dermatologia. Between September 1986 and February 1988, a case-control study involving 27 Italian dermatological centers collaborating in the Gruppo Italiano Studi Epidemiologici in Dermatologia was conducted, concerning the relationship between history of several medical conditions and exposures to drugs and the risk of lichen planus. The cases were all consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of lichen planus, and the controls were patients under dermatological care observed under the same conditions. A total of 711 cases and 1395 controls met the admission criteria and were interviewed by trained investigators. Patients with histories of alopecia areata were found to be at risk for lichen planus (relative risk = 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.5). Five patients (0.7%) in the group with lichen planus had a history of ulcerative colitis, while none of the controls had this disease. The risk of lichen planus was also increased in patients with a history of chronic active hepatitis, but this increase was not statistically significant (relative risk = 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 29.4). \nBilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism demonstrated in a patient with cerebellar astrocytoma. A case of calcification in the striopallidodentate system associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism, clinically manifested after operation for a cystic astrocytoma of the cerebellar vermis, is reported. Bilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification accompanying a disturbance in calcium metabolism is rare. Only a few cases have been described previously in the literature, of which only six were accompanied by pseudohypoparathyroidism. The importance of identifying hypoparathyroidism, especially pseudohypoparathyroidism, early in the course of investigation is discussed. \nUse of echocardiography for patient management in chronic ischemic heart disease. Myocardial ischemia causes regional myocardial contractile and relaxation abnormalities. The extent of ischemia is determined by the distribution and severity of coronary artery stenoses. In coronary heart disease, two powerful predictors of prognosis are the coronary anatomy and ventricular function. Management in coronary heart disease is directed by accurate diagnosis and individualized objectives. Echocardiography at rest and exercise, combined with Doppler and color flow imaging, are properly applied to the differential diagnosis of common clinical syndromes in ischemic heart disease, the identification of the proximal coronary arteries, and the effects of ischemia and prior infarction. Subsequent use of coronary arteriography partially depends on the philosophy regarding the applicability of coronary surgery or angioplasty in an individual patient. Prediction of multivessel, left main, or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease by extensive wall motion abnormalities or an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction may direct the clinician to coronary arteriography to select among coronary surgery, angioplasty, or medical management. \nAlpha 1-antitrypsin clearance as an aid in the management of patients with celiac disease. One hundred and thirty-two different intestinal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance tests were performed in 48 untreated adult celiac patients, 64 patients taking a gluten-free diet, and 20 adult healthy controls. In the untreated group, 95% of patients had enteric protein loss with values higher than the upper limit of normality (mean +/- 2 SD). In the treated group of patients, only 22% had abnormal levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance. Sixteen patients who had elevated clearance before treatment had decreased clearance after an average of 7.4 months on a gluten-free diet. There was a significant relation (p less than 0.05) between the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and the degree of alteration of the jejunal histological structure. We conclude that enteric protein loss is a very frequent finding in celiac patients and the measurement of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance may be a reliable method to evaluate the activity of the disease and useful in following the efficacy of treatment. \nPleomorphic fibroma of skin. A case report and immunohistochemical study. An immunohistochemical study of a clinically benin but cytologically atypical mesenchymal lesion of the skin is presented. This lesion has been previously reported as pleomorphic fibroma and was shown to follow a benign course with a potential for local recurrence. These lesions contain occasional markedly atypical enlarged spindle cells with anaplastic-appearing nuclei. Nonmirror image mitotic figures may be present. Histogenesis of this neoplasm remains controversial with a fibroblastic origin being favored by previous authors. Our immunohistochemical findings would support this conclusion. \nAutosomal dominant deletions of the mitochondrial genome in a case of progressive encephalomyopathy. Multiple deletions of the mitochondrial genome were found in a family in which the proband had ataxia and ketoacidotic comas. A progressive multiorgan involvement appeared in the course of the disease, and histopathological investigation demonstrated mitochondrial myopathy features with ragged red fibers. A defect of oxidative phosphorylation was found in both skeletal muscle and lymphocytes. It is surprising that various mtDNA deletions were detected both in the proband and in his healthy mother and maternal aunt but not in the rest of the maternal progeny. All the deletions were located between Cox II and cytochrome b genes, and short (4-5 bp) repeated sequences were consistently present at the boundaries of the rearrangements in different tissues. Therefore, the deletions appear not to be transmitted per se but to be inherited in a Mendelian manner, being possibly dominant. Both the Mendelian inheritance of the trait and the variety of the deletions in carriers suggest that a nuclearly encoded factor(s) might be involved in the triggering of the deletions. However, the presence of the rearrangements in healthy individuals raises the question of whether mtDNA deletions actually cause the clinical expression of the disease. \nRelationship between perceived self-control of pain, pain description and functioning. Recent research has shown an association between preferred coping style and pain report. The present study explores in a sample of 51 patients with chronic pain of myofascial origin the relationship between a dispositional measure of coping, the internality dimension of the Pain Locus of Control Scale (PLOC), and ratings of pain intensity, frequency, and pain-related behavioral functioning. Patients above the median on the internality dimension of the PLOC reported their pain as less intense and frequent than those below the median. No differences were noted on the behavioral functioning measures. Results are consistent with previous studies and indicate an association between ability to control pain and variations in magnitude and periodicity of pain. The clinical implication of the data is that strategies which provide reduction in pain intensity and frequency might be expected to result in increased perception of personal control of pain. \nSpectrum of intestinal failure in a specialised unit. 300 consecutive admissions over 7 years to a purpose-built intestinal failure unit are reviewed. The commonest underlying condition was Crohn's disease (42%), and the commonest complication precipitating admission was intestinal fistula (42%). Total parenteral nutrition was used in 85% and surgery in 50%. A multidisciplinary approach to management gave a high success rate--90% of patients were discharged from hospital, although nearly 25% needed home parental nutrition. These results suggest that chronic intestinal failure should be managed in specialised units in the same manner as other types of organ failure. \nThe dopamine D2 receptor locus as a modifying gene in neuropsychiatric disorders OBJECTIVE.--The A1 allele of the Taq I polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene has been earlier reported to occur in 69% of alcoholics, compared with 20% of controls. Other research has reported no significant difference in the prevalence of the A1 allele in alcoholics vs controls and no evidence that the DRD2 gene was linked to alcoholism. We hypothesized that these seemingly conflicting results might be because increases in the prevalence of the A1 allele may not be specific to alcoholism. Thus, we examined other disorders frequently associated with alcoholism or those believed to involve defects in dopaminergic neurotransmission. DESIGN.--Case comparison study. To minimize the effect of racial differences in gene frequencies, the study was restricted to non-Hispanic whites. SETTING.--Ambulatory and hospitalized patients. RESULTS.--Among all known controls (n = 314), 77 (24.5%) carried the A1 allele. Of the 69 controls known not to be alcoholics, 10 (14.5%) carried the A1 allele. The prevalence of the A1 allele was significantly increased in patients with Tourette's syndrome (44.9%, n = 147), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (46.2%, n = 104), autism (54.5%, n = 33), alcoholism (42.3%, n = 104), and posttraumatic stress disorder (45.7%, n = 35). After correction for multiple comparisons (requiring P less than .0009 for significance), all remained significant except posttraumatic stress disorder. The prevalence of the A1 allele was not significantly increased in patients with depression, panic attacks, Parkinson's disease, or obesity. The prevalence of the A1 allele in drug addiction and schizophrenia was only significant when compared with that of controls who were not alcoholics, and no correction was made for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSION.--These results suggest the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene is associated with a number of behavior disorders in which it may act as a modifying gene rather than as the primary etiological agent. \nHuman abdominal aortic aneurysms. Immunophenotypic analysis suggesting an immune-mediated response. Cellular immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this report the potential role of these cells in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms by immunohistochemistry was investigated. Aortic tissues from 32 patients were examined: 4 normal aortas, 6 aortas with occlusive atherosclerotic disease, 17 abdominal aortic aneurysms, and 5 inflammatory abdominal aneurysms. Using monoclonal anti-CD3 (T cells), anti-CD19 (B cells), anti-CD11c (macrophages), anti-CD4 (T helper cells), and anti-CD8 (T suppressor cells), several distinctions among these groups were found. The amount of inflammatory cell infiltrate was as follows: inflammatory aneurysms more than abdominal aortic aneurysms more than occlusive aortas more than normal aortas. CD3-positive T lymphocytes rarely were found in the adventitia of normal or occlusive aortas. In contrast, abdominal aortic aneurysms and inflammatory aneurysms exhibited most of the CD3-positive infiltrates in the adventitia. CD19-positive B lymphocytes were present mainly in the adventitia of all pathologic tissues. The CD4-positive:CD8-positive ratio was greater in abdominal aortic aneurysms and inflammatory aneurysms than in the other groups, both in the adventitia and in the media of the aortas. CD11c-positive macrophages were present throughout the diseased tissues, often surrounded by lymphoid aggregates; the greatest numbers of macrophages were found in the inflammatory aneurysm group. Our data suggests that the aneurysmal disease may progress from occlusive disease and is accompanied by an increase in chronic inflammatory cells as well as a redistribution of these cell types. Therefore it is suggested that aneurysmal disease may represent an immune-mediated event. \nPulse sounds and measurement of diastolic blood pressure in children. Controversy exists over the value of measuring diastolic blood pressure (BP) in children, and over whether this should be measured at Korotkoff's fourth phase (K4) or fifth phase (K5) of pulse sounds. We measured diastolic BP in 3012 randomly selected Finnish children aged 6-18 years in 1980, and in 2885 of the same individuals in 1983 and 2500 in 1986. BP was measured with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer in 1980 and 1983, and with a random-zero sphygmomanometer in 1986. K4 was consistently absent in 187 individuals (3.2%) in 1980 and 1983, and in 155 individuals (6.2%) in 1986. K5 was absent in only 34 individuals (0.6%) in 1980/83 and 5 (0.2%) in 1986. The difference between mean K4 and K5 diastolic BP varied from 6.5 to 9.2 mm Hg depending upon age. K4 and K5 BPs showed good correlation in all age groups. Reliable and repeatable BP measurements in all age groups of children are best achieved with K5 as the indicator of diastolic BP. \nEffects of diclofenac sodium on intestinal anastomotic healing. Experimental study on the small intestine of rabbits. To study the possible effects of diclofenac sodium on intestinal anastomoses, 48 rabbits were submitted to surgery consisting of two single-layer ileal anastomoses performed with separate propylene 5-0 sutures. The animals were divided at random into two groups (test and control). The animals in the test group were given intramuscular injections of diclofenac sodium at the dose of 3 mg/kg body weight at 24-hour intervals, and the control animals were given injections of an identical amount of 0.9 percent saline. The animals were sacrificed on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th postoperative days for macroscopic evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and of the anastomoses, tensile strength measurement, hydroxyproline determination, and histopathologic examination. The following results were observed: anastomotic dehiscence followed by peritonitis and death in five test animals (20.83 percent) and no control animals; decreased anastomotic tensile strength on the 7th day in test animals (P less than 0.05); delayed acute inflammatory response and onset of fibroblast proliferation in the test group; and similar hydroxyproline levels in both groups. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that diclofenac sodium had a negative effect on intestinal anastomotic healing. \nEffect of the degree of effort on exercise echocardiography for the detection of restenosis after coronary artery angioplasty. To determine whether the accuracy of exercise echocardiography is affected by the degree of effort during exercise, we examined 101 patients who had 6 months earlier undergone successful coronary artery angioplasty, with resting and immediate postexercise echocardiography and same-day coronary angiography. A positive exercise echocardiographic response was defined as the development of a new or worsening wall motion abnormality postexercise, compared with resting wall motion. Significant coronary disease (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) was present in 48 patients, 38 of whom had single-vessel disease and 10 of whom had two-vessel disease. Exercise echocardiography correctly identified 32 patients with significant disease (sensitivity 67%) and 44 patients without significant disease (specificity 83%). The effect of the degree of exercise effort on the sensitivity and specificity of the test was evaluated by three criteria; (1) the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate (MHR), (2) the duration of exercise (DUR), and (3) the double product (DP). To determine the influence of the degree of effort upon sensitivity and specificity, the effort criteria were compared between patients with true positive (TP) tests to those with false negative tests (FN), and in patients with true negative (TN) tests compared with those with false positive (FP) tests. No significant differences were detected in MHR, DUR, or DP between TP versus FN patients or between TN versus FP patients. These results indicate that for symptom-limited exercise echocardiography in postangioplasty patients, neither sensitivity nor specificity is significantly affected by the degree of effort during exercise. \nQuantitative estimation of infarct size by simultaneous dual radionuclide single photon emission computed tomography: comparison with peak serum creatine kinase activity. To test the hypothesis that simultaneous dual energy single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99m (99mTc) pyrophosphate and thallium-201 (201TI) can provide an accurate estimate of the size of myocardial infarction and to assess the correlation between infarct size and peak serum creatine kinase activity, 165 patients with acute myocardial infarction underwent SPECT 3.2 +/- 1.3 (SD) days after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. In the present study, the difference in the intensity of 99mTc-pyrophosphate accumulation was assumed to be attributable to difference in the volume of infarcted myocardium, and the infarct volume was corrected by the ratio of the myocardial activity to the osseous activity to quantify the intensity of 99mTc-pyrophosphate accumulation. The correlation of measured infarct volume with peak serum creatine kinase activity was significant (r = 0.60, p less than 0.01). There was also a significant linear correlation between the corrected infarct volume and peak serum creatine kinase activity (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01). Subgroup analysis showed a high correlation between corrected volume and peak creatine kinase activity in patients with anterior infarctions (r = 0.75, p less than 0.01) but a poor correlation in patients with inferior or posterior infarctions (r = 0.50, p less than 0.01). In both the early reperfusion and the no reperfusion groups, a good correlation was found between corrected infarct volume and peak serum creatine kinase activity (r = 0.76 and r = 0.76, respectively; p less than 0.01). \nCan iodine-131 whole-body scan be replaced by thyroglobulin measurement in the post-surgical follow-up of differentiated thyroid carcinoma? This study compared serum thyroglobulin measurement and whole-body scans in the post-surgical follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Thyroglobulin levels were measured in 61 patients receiving L-thyroxine therapy after thyroidectomy, and again after suspension of therapy, before performing a whole-body scan with iodine-131. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of thyroglobulin levels, measured during L-thyroxine therapy, for diagnosis of tumor residue or metastases were then calculated and compared with results obtained by diagnostic whole-body scanning. Our data show that neither thyroglobulin levels nor whole-body scans alone can discriminate between patients with or without metastases. Sensitivity reached 95.7%, specificity 100%, and accuracy 96.7% if results of both procedures were also taken into consideration. We conclude that in the management and follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma both parameters need to be evaluated. \nEffect of age on fever response to recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha in a murine model. Certain elderly humans show a blunted fever response to infection. A study was designed using a murine model to assess the influence of age on the febrile response to the endogenous pyrogen, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Twenty (10 young: 4-6 months; 10 old: 24-28 months) BALB/c mice were injected with 50 ng of TNF alpha into the intraperitoneal space; the experiments were repeated one week later with 100 ng TNF alpha. Control animals received intraperitoneal injections of pyrogen-free phosphate buffered saline. Temperatures were measured rectally at baseline and at 10-minute intervals for 90 minutes post-injection using a thermistor probe and temperature gauge. In the majority of the time intervals following injection, the mean temperature changes of young mice were significantly higher than old mice for both 50 ng and 100 ng doses of TNF alpha. Similarly, peak temperature changes from baseline were consistently higher in young animals following injection of TNF alpha. Moreover, the peak temperature changes in young mice after 50 ng TNF alpha injection were significantly higher than those in old mice following a 100 ng injection of TNF alpha. These findings confirm that (a) TNF alpha has a role in the pathogenesis of fever; (b) aging alters significantly the febrile response; and (c) a mechanism of this age-related blunted febrile response may involve TNF alpha. \nJuvenile hyaline fibromatosis: a report of two severe cases. Two unrelated children with a severe form of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis are described. In addition to painful flexion contractures of all of the large joints, oral and skin lesions, and typical radiologic appearance of osteolytic defects, both girls had marked growth retardation and recurrent infections. Both children died in early infancy of overwhelming infection. \nThe erythrocyte-type glucose transporter in blood vessels of primary and metastatic brain tumors. We previously demonstrated that brain microvessels have a high density of the erythrocyte-type glucose transporter and suggested this could be used as a marker of cells with \"occluding\" junctions. Now, we have studied by immunocytochemistry the tissue distribution of the glucose transporter in a variety of primary and metastatic human brain tumors with a monoclonal antibody to the glucose transporter of human erythrocytes. Microvessels in normal brain tissue distant from the tumor, and in brain surrounding the tumor, immunostained strongly for the glucose transporter. Microvessels in primary and metastatic tumors, however, lacked glucose transporter immunoreactivity. Only in the relatively benign juvenile cerebellar astrocytomas was glucose transporter immunoreactivity retained in some of the tumor microvessels. Because a high glucose transporter density is a marker of vessels with barrier properties, our results indicate that the vast majority of brain tumor microvessels do nc, have an intact blood-brain barrier. \nNecrotizing myopathy with pipestem capillaries, microvascular deposition of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC), and minimal cellular infiltration. Three adult patients, two with undifferentiated connective tissue disease and one with carcinoma, had a distinctive pathologic reaction pattern consisting of necrotizing myopathy, minimal cellular infiltration, and a microangiopathy with thick \"pipestem\" vessels and microvascular deposits of complement membrane attack complex. Quantitative analysis revealed focal capillary depletion. This pattern represents an immune-mediated microangiopathy and is distinct from that observed in other inflammatory myopathies. \nPrimary meningeal B lymphoma presenting as a subacute ascending polyradiculoneuropathy. A subacute ascending polyradiculoneuropathy was the main feature of a primary meningeal B lymphoma in two patients. Tumour cells appeared in the CSF eight and six months respectively after the onset of the disease. Treatment by intrathecal methotrexate resulted in transient improvement. \nStripping out pus in lactational mastitis: a means of preventing breast abscess. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether manual stripping of pus from the breasts of women with lactational mastitis is effective in preventing the formation of breast abscesses. DESIGN: Case series (chart review). SETTING: Family practice in Montreal. PATIENTS: All (475) charts of patients with lactational mastitis were reviewed; 61 women were excluded because they already had a breast abscess. Most of the patients had been referred. OUTCOME MEASURES: Abscess formation, length of illness after treatment, rate of recurrence of mastitis, illness in the mother or infant within the 6 weeks after the mastitis and continuance of breast-feeding. MAIN RESULTS: The duration of symptoms before treatment was 1 to 56 (mean 5.3) days. In 9% of the cases both breasts were affected, and in 23% at least one episode of mastitis had previously occurred. The stripping technique was applied to all the patients. Pus was removed in 210 women; the remaining women were considered to have cellulitis. Only four patients (less than 1%) had breast abscesses. The mean length of illness after treatment was 7.2 days. The rate of recurrence was 14%. In all, 6% of the mothers and 9% of the infants became ill in the 6 weeks after the mastitis. Most (92%) of the patients continued to breast-feed. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of abscess formation was considerably lower than the rates reported in the literature. Therefore, manual stripping of pus from the infected breasts of lactating women appears to be effective in preventing breast abscesses. \nFamilial enteric neuropathy with pseudoobstruction. We report a case of autosomal dominant chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction secondary to a familial enteric neuropathy. Esophagogastrointestinal manometry studies in the index case showed decreased postprandial contractile frequency with normal amplitude of pressure activity in the stomach and small bowel. Pupillary function and autonomic reflexes were all normal, excluding an extrinsic autonomic neuropathy of the viscera. Histologic examination of the small intestine by hematoxylin and eosin stains revealed normal smooth muscles but a reduced number of neurons in the myenteric plexus without inflammatory cells or neuroNal intranuclear inclusions. Histologic examination of the myenteric plexus using the sections taken along the longitudinal axis of the intestine, stained with silver by the Smith technique, disclosed decreased numbers of argyrophilic neurons and degeneration of neurons and axons; however, there was no reactive increase in the number of glial cell nuclei. The patient's mother had suffered from chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, which did not abate following extensive small bowel resection. This is the third family reported with an autosomal dominant enteric neuropathy unassociated with evidence of extrinsic autonomic or peripheral neuropathy. Subtotal resection of the small bowel was followed by recurrence of the pseudoobstruction syndrome in both affected members of the family. \nNegative inotropic activity of the calcium antagonists isradipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil in diseased human myocardium. The use of calcium antagonists in the treatment of cardiac failure is limited by the negative inotropic effects they exert. The comparative inotropic activity of four calcium antagonists was therefore investigated, using electrically driven human papillary muscle strips and human atrial trabeculae. These inotropic effects were studied with cumulative concentration-response curves. The four calcium antagonists included in this study were all found to significantly (P less than or equal to .05) diminish the force of contraction above 0.01 mumol/L, but with different potencies. On the basis of the relationship between therapeutic vasoactive plasma concentrations and the negative inotropic effective concentrations in our system in vitro, the ranking order of potential negative inotropism in the treatment of cardiac failure with calcium antagonists was verapamil greater than nifedipine greater than diltiazem greater than isradipine. Thus, to minimize cardiodepressant risk, the use of calcium antagonists with weak negative inotropic effects at relevant concentrations should be preferred, especially in the case of patients with compromised cardiac function. \nCholesterol: a useful parameter for distinguishing between pleural exudates and transudates. Previously established criteria were used to classify 253 pleural effusions as transudates (65 cases), neoplastic exudates (67 cases), tuberculous exudates (65 cases), or miscellaneous exudate (56 cases). The parameters pleural LDH (PLDH), pleural LDH/serum LDH ratio (P/SLDH), and pleural protein/serum protein ratio (P/SPROT) were compared with pleural cholesterol (PCHOL) and the pleural cholesterol/serum cholesterol ratio (P/SCHOL) with regard to their usefulness for distinguishing between pleural exudates and transudates. The PCHOL values determined were 28.5 +/- 12.8 mg/dl for transudates, 88.1 +/- 30 mg/dl for neoplastic exudates, 96.5 +/- 28 mg/dl for tuberculous exudates, and 88 +/- 35.9 mg/dl for the miscellaneous group; the differences between the transudate group and the others are statistically significant (p less than 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of P/SPROT for diagnosis of exudates were both 89 percent; the sensitivity of PLDH was 67 percent and its specificity was 95 percent; the sensitivity and specificity of P/SLDH were both 84.6 percent. Using Light's three criteria as a battery, the sensitivity was 94.6 percent and its specificity was 78.4 percent. All the transudates and 17 (9 percent) of the 188 exudates had PCHOL values below 55 mg/dl, so that with this threshold, PCHOL had a sensitivity of 91 percent and a specificity of 100 percent for diagnosis of exudates. With a threshold of 0.3, P/SCHOL had a sensitivity of 92.5 percent and a specificity of 87.6 percent. The number of misclassifications by PCHOL was less than with any other of the parameters, with statistically significant differences with respect to PLDH (p less than 0.001) and P/SLDH (p less than 0.01). We conclude that determination of PCHOL and P/SCHOL is of great value for distinguishing between pleural exudates and transudates, and should be included in routine laboratory analysis of pleural effusions. \nPathogenetic mechanism of stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: follow-up of stroke patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Stroke patients with brain infarction and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF, n = 88) or sinus rhythm (SR, n = 188), treated at a population-based stroke unit, were studied for 5 years. Within 1 month, 13% of NVAF and 2% of SR patients (P less than 0.01) had either a stroke recurrence or systemic embolism. After 5 years, the corresponding figures were 26 and 25%, respectively. The 1-month and 5-year mortality values were 35 and 78% in the NVAF group vs. 7 and 52% in the SR group (P less than 0.01). Age, ischaemic heart disease and function group on arrival at the hospital were independent risk factors for death. The main cause of death was ischaemic heart disease in the NVAF group, and complications to the initial stroke or a stroke recurrence in the SR group. Thus a higher risk of death, stroke recurrence and peripheral embolism was evident only during the first month after stroke. \nMefloquine-resistant falciparum malaria on the Thai-Burmese border Mefloquine is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated multiresistant falciparum malaria, and in combination with sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine (MSP) at a single dose of 15/30/1.5 mg/kg, respectively, has been used in Thailand for the past 6 years. In 1985-86, MSP cured over 98% of 5192 patients with falciparum malaria on the Thai-Burmese border. 4 years later we studied the efficacy of MSP in 395 patients at the same location. The cure rate at 28 days was 70.8% (95% Cl 67-77.2%). The proportion of early treatment failures (in whom parasitaemia did not clear) had risen from 0.27 to 3.7% (p less than 0.0001). Failure rates were 50% in children under 6 years old, 29% in the 6-15 age group, and 19% in adults (p less than 0.001). Patients with early treatment failure were retreated with 25 mg/kg mefloquine, but 27% had a further recrudescence of infection within 28 days. The mean (95% Cl) serum mefloquine concentration at the time of first recrudescence was 638 (546-730) ng/ml, a value previously associated with successful treatment. Mefloquine concentrations were no lower in those with recrudescent infections than in age-matched successfully treated patients, suggesting that pharmacokinetic factors were not responsible for the high treatment-failure rate. Plasmodium falciparum has developed resistance to mefloquine rapidly, despite the addition of sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine and strict control of drug administration. The MSP combination should now be abandoned. \nDNA damage in cultured human skin fibroblasts exposed to excimer laser radiation. Ultraviolet excimer lasers are being considered for use in a variety of refractive and therapeutic procedures, the long-term biologic consequences of which are unknown. The effect of sublethal doses of 193-nm laser radiation on cellular DNA was examined in cultured human skin fibroblasts. In contrast to 248 nm, treatments with the 193-nm laser radiation below 70 J/m2 did not cause significant pyrimidine dimer formation in the skin cells. This was indicated by the lack of excision repair activities (unscheduled DNA synthesis assay), and further demonstrated by direct analysis of pyrimidine dimers in DNA from irradiated cells. However, a low level of unscheduled DNA synthesis could be detected following irradiation at 193 nm with 70 J/m2. Both the 193-nm and 248-nm radiation were able to induce chromosomal aberrations, as indicated by a micronucleus assay. A dose-dependent increase in micronuclei frequency was observed 48 and 72 h after laser irradiation. These results indicate that exposure of actively replicating human skin fibroblasts to sublethal doses of either 193- or 248-nm laser radiation can result in genotoxicity. \nAlcohol craving in rehabilitation: assessment of nutrition therapy. If untreated, alcohol abuse, which often results from alcohol craving, causes major metabolic abnormalities, altered life-styles, lost productivity, and eventually death. Biochemical mechanisms that may contribute to alcohol craving include the stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, the endogenous opiate beta-endorphin system, neurotransmitter synthesis and release, hypoglycemia, and nutrient deficiencies. The macronutrient ratio of meals, the resulting insulin response, and nutrient blood levels can affect amino acid and nutrient transport across the blood-brain barrier. Researchers have reported that animals increase alcohol intake when fed nutrient-deficient diets or after stressful experience. A pilot study was designed to assess the effects of nutrition therapy added to a traditional rehabilitation program based on the 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous. One study group received traditional therapy; the other study group received traditional therapy and nutrition therapy consisting of modified menus and individualized nutrition counseling. Patients who received nutrition therapy reported significantly fewer hypoglycemic symptoms, lower sugar intake, less alcohol craving as well as significantly greater nutrient intakes; a greater number abstained from alcohol. These findings indicate that nutrition therapy can aid in the recovery from alcoholism. \nSuccessful combined operation for Takayasu's arteritis. We report a case of Takayasu's arteritis complicated with aortic regurgitation and severe stenosis of the left coronary ostium and the innominate artery. Simultaneous surgical treatment of aortic valve replacement, coronary ostium endarterectomy, and aortosubclavian artery bypass using saphenous vein were performed. We discuss the choice of simultaneous operation and the option of surgical treatment for coronary ostium lesion due to Takayasu's arteritis. \nHealth implications of obesity in American Indians and Alaska Natives. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are experiencing an epidemic of diabetes, increasing rates of coronary artery disease and hypertension, and poor survival rates for breast cancer that are likely partially attributable to the increasing prevalence of obesity over the past generation. Obesity may also contribute to the high rates of gallstones and to adverse outcomes of pregnancy in AI/ANs. Although overall mortality was not associated with obesity in Pima Indians (except in the most obese men), the relationship of obesity to longevity in other AI/AN groups is not known. Further study of the specific health effects of obesity in various groups of AI/ANs are needed. In the meantime, community-based programs to prevent obesity and its sequelae should be implemented in all AI/AN communities. \nNongynecologic somatic pathology in women with chronic pelvic pain and negative laparoscopy. One hundred eighty-three women with chronic pelvic pain were referred to a multidisciplinary chronic pelvic pain clinic after negative laparoscopy. One hundred twenty-two of them completed a thorough medical and psychologic evaluation and were followed for a minimum of six months after completion of therapy. Occult somatic pathology was diagnosed in 57 women (47%), including 19 in whom coexistent psychopathology was diagnosed. Myofascial pain was the most common somatic diagnosis, followed by atypical cyclic pain (dysmenorrhea or mittelschmerz); gastroenterologic, urologic and infectious diseases; and pelvic vascular congestion. No plausible somatic etiology was apparent in the remaining 65 (53%) of the 122 referrals. Nongynecologic somatic pathology accounted for 34 (29%) and gynecologic pathology for 23 (19%) of the referrals, only 6 (5%) of whom ultimately required hysterectomy. Women with a somatic diagnosis were found to be significantly older than the remainder of the referral population. Long-term symptomatic improvement or resolution of pain was obtained in 43 (75%) of the 57 patients with somatic diagnoses. Coexistent psychopathology was found to correlate with a poorer long-term prognosis. Our findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating and treating chronic pelvic pain in women and confirm that hysterectomy is indicated in this setting only rarely. \nStandards for evaluating and reporting the results of surgical and percutaneous therapy for peripheral arterial disease. By adopting precise definitions of essential terms, developing objective criteria by which the various measures of success or failure can be judged, and establishing a standardized scheme by which severity of disease, degrees of improvement or deterioration, and risk factors that affect outcome can be graded, the quality of published reports of revascularization procedures for lower extremity ischemia can be greatly improved, allowing comparative evaluation of treatment modalities. \nHistamine H2-receptor antagonists. In summary, histamine initiates acid secretion by stimulating the H2 subtype histamine receptor on parietal cells. Cimetidine, rantidine, famotidine, and nizantidine are histamine H2-receptor antagonists that block this action of histamine, reducing gastric acid output and concentration under both basal and stimulated conditions. These agents are used for treatment and prevention of peptic and stress ulcers as well as for hypersecretory states. Because of their effectiveness and low incidence of side effects, H2-antagonists have largely replaced more traditional antiulcer regimens. \nVerrucous carcinoma of the bladder. Verrucous carcinoma of the bladder unassociated with bilharzial cystitis is an exceedingly rare entity, with only 3 cases reported in the literature. We describe a patient and review the literature concerning verrucous carcinoma. \nGrafting of perfused adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease. Clinica Puerta de Hierro Neural Transplantation Group. The authors report results obtained in 20 severely affected patients with Parkinson's disease (Grade IV or V) who received an autotransplant of perfused adrenal medullary tissue. This study seems to indicate that these autoimplants can improve the parkinsonian symptomatology and induce amelioration in the patients' performance of routine activities. All the symptoms analyzed showed improvement, although it differed in intensity and time of onset. Moreover, this improvement was accompanied by a reduction in the daily intake of L-dopa, with discontinuance of dopamine agonists and amantadine. A number of medical complications were encountered, including three deaths, probably related to performing abdominal surgery in seriously affected parkinsonian patients who were unable to tolerate the discontinuance of their medication. The transient psychiatric disorders observed appeared to be related to the postoperative dose of L-dopa and/or anticholinergic agents administered, and diminished or disappeared when the doses were reduced. The reasons for improvement, which was bilateral, remain unknown, although one cause may be the surgical trauma (minicaudotomy) together with the implantation of adrenal medullary tissue, which may promote the sprouting of surviving dopaminergic fibers. Moreover, in this series, perfusion of adrenal medulla increased the capacity for revascularization of the tissue and may have reduced the damaging effects of warm ischemia on the cells. This, together with the existence of fenestrated vessels, could hypothetically have served as an access point for drugs, and if the implanted cells were viable, they might have served to store and manufacture different factors and/or transmitters. These results as well as those of other groups justify the development of a controlled international clinical trial. \nPrincipal causes of mechanical bowel obstruction in surgically treated adults in western Turkey. A retrospective study of the principal causes of mechanical bowel obstruction occurring in Western Turkey between 1979 and 1989 was undertaken. The records of 14,777 operations performed in the general surgery departments of two hospitals were reviewed. Mechanical bowel obstruction occurred in 582 patients. Among the causes of mechanical bowel obstruction, adhesions were most common (44.0 per cent), followed by strangulated hernia (23.9 per cent), volvuli (12.7 per cent) and colonic carcinomas (10.1 per cent). A previous appendicectomy appeared to be the most important cause of adhesions causing mechanical bowel obstruction. \nUndifferentiated carcinoma of parotid gland. Two cases of undifferentiated carcinomas of the major salivary glands were studied using immunohistochemical techniques. Results showed that this entity was a high grade malignant neoplasm arising from the excretory duct. Despite the undifferentiated appearance multiple immunophenotypes were evident in both cases. \nFunctional properties of the beta-globin locus control region in K562 erythroleukemia cells. In this report, we compare the function of the human beta-globin locus control region (LCR) in three K562 erythroleukemia cell assays, including (1) a transient transfection assay for \"classical\" enhancer activity, (2) a colony assay that detects \"productive integration events,\" and (3) an assay that detects the ability of LCR fragments to confer hemin inducibility on linked, stably integrated gamma-globin promoters. Various LCR fragments were inserted into an expression vector consisting of an A gamma-globin promoter driving the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (gamma-neo). Using these vectors, we determined that a 2.5-kb DNA fragment containing LCR sites I through IV (previously named mu locus activation region [mu LAR]) had activity in all three assays; of the individual LCR sites, only site II was highly active in all three assays. One region within site II, consisting of tandem AP-1/NF-E2 consensus elements, had approximately 10% as much colony assay activity as the entire mu LAR. However, this region did not have detectable activity in a transient enhancer assay in uninduced K562 cells, nor was it capable of conferring hemin inducibility on linked gamma-globin promoters in stably transfected cells. Finally, we tested the ability of the mu LAR to activate promoters (beta-globin and cathepsin G) that are not normally expressed in K562 cells. beta-neo was minimally activated by the mu LAR in transient transfection experiments. The mu LAR increased the number of stably transfected colonies produced by beta-neo, but the absolute number of beta-neo colonies, with or without the mu LAR, was approximately 10% to 20% that of gamma-neo. In contrast, a minimal cathepsin G promoter was activated by the mu LAR in K562 cells. Our results suggest that LCR functions are dependent in part on the environments and the promoters with which the LCR is tested. \nEffects of urokinase and heparin on minimal cross-sectional area of the culprit narrowing in unstable angina pectoris. The immediate and delayed effects of urokinase and heparin on minimal cross-sectional area of a patent ischemia-producing coronary artery were prospectively investigated in 43 patients with unstable angina. After baseline angiography, patients were randomized to 3 different treatment groups: group I--urokinase (1,000,000 U intravenous bolus dose), followed by heparin infusion 3 hours later; group II--heparin (10,000 U intravenous bolus, followed by continuous infusion); and group III--conventional therapy only (intravenous nitroglycerin, beta blockers and calcium antagonists). Angiography was repeated at 1 hour and at 8 days of treatment and minimal cross-sectional area was determined in the 35 patients who completed the study. In group I, minimal cross-sectional area increased from 0.84 +/- 0.48 mm2 at baseline to 0.94 +/- 0.49 mm2 at 1 hour (p less than 0.05), and to 1.00 +/- 0.51 mm2 at 8 days (p less than 0.01 vs baseline). In group II, a significant increase in minimal cross-sectional area was observed only at the 8-day angiography (0.64 +/- 0.39 mm2 at baseline; 0.67 +/- 0.37 mm2 at 1 hour [p = not significant]; and 0.79 +/- 0.48 mm2 at 8 days [p less than 0.01] vs baseline). In group III, no significant changes in minimal cross-sectional area occurred either at 1 hour or at 8 days. Thus, both urokinase and heparin improved lesion geometry in patients with unstable angina, although a large individual variation was noticed. The effect occurred earlier with urokinase than with heparin. \nPredominant expression of lambda light chain in adult cases with non-T-cell acute lymphocytic and chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis. The authors investigated cytoplasmic immunoglobulins of the leukemic cells from 20 adult cases with non-T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and from three cases with chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis using immunoelectron microscopy. They also studied these cases using various monoclonal antibodies. Of the 23 examined cases, nine were negative for both heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins; the authors defined these as common ALL. Two cases were positive for the mu chain but were negative for light chains; the authors defined these as pre-B-cell ALL. The remaining 12 cases were positive for either kappa or lambda light chains; these were defined as B-cell ALL. Of the 12 cases positive for light chains, 11 were positive for the lambda chain. Seven cases of the 11 positive cases for the lambda chain were negative for heavy chains. Eleven cases were positive either for both My4 and My9 or for one of the two antibodies. From these results, the authors conclude the following: (1) the ratio of pre-B-cell ALL among non-T-cell ALL cases (two of 23 cases) was lower in adults than in children; (2) of the light chain-positive cases, the lambda light chain-positive cases predominated (11 of 12 cases); (3) heavy chain-negative, lambda chain-positive cases (seven cases) were observed; and (4) one half of the leukemia cases showed dual phenotypes of B-cell and myeloid cell lineages. \nCytokine gene expression in the islets of the diabetic Biobreeding/Worcester rat. The Biobreeding Worcester rat provides one of the best models of autoimmune diabetes. Immunopathologic studies of acute diabetes show that the islets are infiltrated by T cells and macrophages. It has been hypothesized that the islets are damaged by the secretion of cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha and that their function may be altered by IL-6. In this study, we utilized in situ hybridization to determine the expression of the IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 genes within the pancreas of the acute diabetic Biobreeding Worcester rat. These studies showed that cells expressing IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 were present within the islets and in the exocrine pancreas surrounding islets, ducts, and vessels and in an interstitial location. Cells expressing TNF and IL-1 mRNA were present in about 20% of the islets, whereas cells expressing IL-6 were present in about 4% of the islets. Islets containing TNF- or IL-1-positive cells contained about three positive cells per islet whereas only about one IL-6-positive cell was present per islet. In 26% of the islets peri-insular TNF-positive cells were found. Peri-insular IL-1 positive cells were seen in 14% of the islets and 8% showed peri-insular IL-6 positive cells. In nondiabetic 30-day old DP or 90-day-old DR rats intra-islet cytokine gene expression was not seen. Our studies support the view that cytokines are important in beta cell destruction. \nCerebrovascular accident complicating acute myocardial infarction: incidence, clinical significance and short- and long-term mortality rates. The SPRINT Study Group. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report the incidence, the antecedents, and the clinical significance of clinically recognized cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks (CVA-TIA) complicating acute myocardial infarction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 1981 to 1983, a secondary prevention study with nifedipine (SPRINT) was conducted in 14 hospitals in Israel among 2,276 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the study, demographic, historical, and medical data were collected on special forms for all patients with diagnosed acute myocardial infarction in 13 of these 14 hospitals (the SPRINT registry, n = 5,839). Mortality follow-up was completed for 99% of hospital survivors for a mean follow-up of 5.5 years (range: 4.5 to 7 years). RESULTS: The incidence of CVA-TIA was 0.9% (54 of 5,839). The latter rate increased significantly only with age, from 0.4% among patients up to 59 years old to 1.6% among those aged greater than or equal to 70 years. Multivariate analysis identified age, congestive heart failure, and history of stroke as predictors of CVA-TIA during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. Patients with CVA-TIA exhibited a complicated hospital course, with a 15-day mortality rate of 41%. Subsequent mortality rates in survivors at 1 and 5 years were 34% and 59%, respectively. Rates at the same time points in patients without CVA-TIA were 16%, 11%, and 29% (p less than 0.01). In a multivariate analysis that included age, gender, congestive heart failure, history of previous myocardial infarction, and hypertension, CVA-TIA was independently associated with increased 15-day mortality (covariate-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.62; 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.59 to 4.32), as well as subsequent 1-year (OR = 3.29; 90% CI, 1.70 to 6.36) and long-term (mean follow-up = 5.5 years) mortality (OR = 2.46; 90% CI, 1.30 to 4.69). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of consecutive patients with myocardial infarction, CVA-TIA was a relatively infrequent complication of acute myocardial infarction. Factors independently favoring the occurrence of CVA-TIA were old age, previous CVA, and congestive heart failure. CVA-TIA occurring during acute myocardial infarction independently increased the risk of early death threefold as well as the risk of long-term mortality in early-phase survivors. (2.5-fold). \nLow-back pain and disk degeneration in children: a case-control MR imaging study. Thirty-nine 15-year-old children with low-back pain (LBP) and 39 asymptomatic control children were selected from a population of 1,503 children of the same age for a magnetic resonance imaging study of the lumbar spine. Subjects with LBP were matched with control subjects by age, sex, and school class. Disk degeneration (DD) was present in 15 (38%) of the children with LBP and in 10 (26%) of the control subjects. Lumbar degeneration was most frequently associated with disk protrusion and Scheuermann-type changes. Of assessed structural abnormalities (disk protrusion, Scheuermann-type changes, transitional vertebra, and disk space narrowing), only disk protrusion was more common in children of the LBP group than in control subjects. The authors conclude that DD is a frequent finding among children with LBP at the age of 15 years. Asymptomatic (possibly physiologic) DD also is frequently found in children of this age. Whether DD associated with structural changes predisposes to low-back disorders can be confirmed only by means of a longitudinal follow-up study. \nMotor responses after transcranial electrical stimulation of cerebral hemispheres with a degenerated pyramidal tract. Motor responses were evoked in the thenar muscles by transcranial electrical cortex stimulation in 5 stroke patients with an isolated lacuna in the internal capsule, in whom wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract was demonstrated in vivo. Suprathreshold stimulation of the affected hemisphere elicited bilateral motor responses; whereas, stimulation at identical intensities of the undamaged hemisphere yielded strictly unilateral responses in the contralateral hand, like the responses of all normal control subjects. Focused magnetic brain stimulation was performed in 1 patient and gave identical results. Because muscular excitability to cortical stimulation is preserved in spite of pyramidal tract disruption, other pathways must bypass the lesion. Because of the bilaterality of responses, we suggest polysynaptic corticoreticulospinal connections. \nThe Libyan Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease focus in Israel: an epidemiologic evaluation. In a country-wide study of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in Israel, we diagnosed 114 cases, among them 49 Libyan-born, with onset of their disease during the years 1963-1987. After age adjustment, the mean annual incidence rate per million population was 43 among Libyan-born and 0.9 in the rest of the population. Among Jews born in Egypt and Tunisia, neighboring countries of Libya, the adjusted rates were higher than in the other Israelis (3.5 and 2.3 per million, respectively). Among Libyan Jews, there was no association between incidence rate of CJD and age at immigration, ie, duration of exposure to hypothetical infectious factor in Libya. The percent of familial cases among Libyan Jews (41 to 47%) is one of the highest ever published. Genetic factors seem to be important for the high incidence of CJD among Libyan Jews. \nParadoxical vocal cord motion: an unusual cause of stridor. Stridor due to obstructive causes is relatively common. Functional airway obstruction with paradoxical vocal cord motion is uncommon. Only 12 cases have been reported in the literature in the past 15 years. The majority were young female patients. We have recently encountered two cases. Lack of awareness of this condition caused several problems in management. \nCystoid macular edema secondary to juxtafoveolar telangiectasis in Coats' disease. A 28-year-old man with unilateral Coats' disease and cystoid macular edema secondary to juxtafoveolar telangiectasis underwent successful juxtafoveolar argon green laser photocoagulation therapy with resolution of the edema and improvement in metamorphopsia and visual acuity. Despite this success, the effect of laser therapy in these patients remains uncertain. It should be considered only after detailed discussion with the patient about the possibility of posttreatment paracentral scotomata and the alternative of a reasonable period of observation for possible spontaneous resolution of the edema. \nSeasonality of disease in Kuwait. To compare the seasonal variation in total mortality and deaths from cardiovascular, respiratory, and malignant disease, data were collected from North-East Scotland (Grampian region) and Kuwait. Seasonal differences were similar, in both timing and degree, for total mortality and deaths from circulatory disease, but were greater in Kuwait for respiratory disease. Peak mortality was during winter in both areas: in Grampian, when the climate is most uncomfortable, and in Kuwait, when the climate is at its most comfortable. Socioeconomic changes in Kuwait have been accompanied by a rapid fall in the degree of seasonality (deseasonality) for both total and infant mortality. These findings suggest that mortality peaks in winter, not because of a seasonally low temperature, but because of a seasonal fall in mean temperature irrespective of the annual mean temperature. \nLimited heterogeneity of the HLA class II contribution to susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis is suggested by positive associations with HLA-DR4, DR1 and DRw10. Most patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) exhibit an HLA class II epitope found on most DR4 and DR1 molecules. We have investigated the possibility of other associations being present in the minority of patients lacking these antigens. One hundred and eighty patients with classical or definite RA and 100 controls were assigned HLA-DR, DQ and DP types by a DNA-based system using sequence-specific oligonucleotides to probe amplified class II alleles amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The expected associations with DR4 (relative risk 10, P less than 0.0001) and DR1 (relative risk 2.3, P less than 0.001) were observed and only 13% of individuals lacked both of these alleles compared with 54% of age- and race-matched controls. A significant association with DRw10 (P = 0.02) was also observed in the DR4/DR1-negative RA group (3/23 patients compared with 0/54 DR4/DR1-negative controls). No novel associations with other DR, DQ, or DP alleles were evident in contrast to some previous studies. The third allelic hypervariable region of the DR beta chain of DRw10 contains a similar amino acid sequence to that found in many DR4 and DR1 molecules. These results extend this correlation and suggest that this susceptibility determinant may account for the HLA-linked susceptibility in 89% of our cases of RA. \nVon Hippel-Lindau disease and erythrocytosis: radioimmunoassay of erythropoietin in cyst fluid from a brainstem hemangioblastoma. A 59-year-old woman with von Hippel-Lindau disease developed erythrocytosis and a recurrent intracranial hemangioblastoma. Radioimmunoassay showed an elevated level of erythropoietin in her serum. Cyst fluid from the tumor also contained erythropoietin, concentrated a thousandfold relative to the serum level. Production of erythropoietin by hemangioblastomas may explain the erythrocytosis present in some patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. \nPlasticity of central motor pathways in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. To obtain neurophysiologic evidence for a reorganization of central motor pathways in children who had suffered a cerebral lesion at birth, we performed cross-correlation analyses of multiunit EMG recordings obtained from children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy and marked mirror movements. We found that the motoneuron pools of homologous left and right hand muscles received common synaptic input from abnormally branched presynaptic axons. The results of electromagnetic brain stimulation, cutaneomuscular, and tendon reflex testing suggested that these common inputs are provided by abnormally branched corticospinal tract fibers whose origin is the undamaged motor cortex. \nSerotonin antagonists: a new class of antiemetic agents. Despite a number of significant advances over the past decade, prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis remain formidable problems, particularly with cisplatin-containing regimens. Nearly one third of patients receiving high-dose cisplatin still experience substantial emesis despite the best available conventional antiemetics, and the toxic effects of these agents remain quite troublesome. In recent years, a new class of agents, the serotonin antagonists, has been identified. These agents hold promise for clinical utility in a wide range of areas. Selective antagonists of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) type 3 (5-HT3) receptor have proven in early clinical trials to be potent antiemetic agents in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, with efficacy comparable to or superior to that of conventional antiemetics. Toxic effects to date with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been modest. The current state of knowledge with respect to these agents as antiemetics for patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy is summarized. \nRecombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after autologous bone marrow transplantation for relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: blood and bone marrow progenitor growth studies. A phase II Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trial. Sixteen patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and infusion of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF). Treatment consisted of involved-field radiotherapy, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d intravenously (IV) for 2 days, and fractionated total body irradiation (1,200 cGy). Autologous bone marrow was thawed and infused IV, followed 3 hours later by the first infusion of IV rhGM-CSF 11 micrograms/kg/d over 4 hours. Infusions of rhGM-CSF were continued daily until either both neutrophil count exceeded 1,500/microL and platelet count exceeded 50,000/microL, or until 30 days after marrow re-infusion. Toxicities encountered were mild and included fever, chills, hypertension, alopecia, rash, diarrhea, stomatitis, myalgias, and synovial (knee) effusions. Neutrophil recovery greater than 500/microL occurred a median of 14 days (range, 9 to 30 days) after marrow infusion, significantly earlier than in a comparable group of historic controls who recovered counts at a median time of 20 days (range, 12 to 51 days) (P = .00002). Median time to self-sustaining platelet counts greater than 20,000/microL was 23.5 days (range, 12 to 100 days), comparable with the historic group (P = .38). One bacteremia (central venous catheter exit site infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis) and one local infection (Giardia lamblia in stool) occurred. Patients received a median of 11.4 (range, 4.4 to 20.2) x 10(4) colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitors per kg. Stem cell progenitors CFU-GM, CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) were detected in the bone marrow as early as 7 days after marrow re-infusion, and increased in proportion to peripheral blood counts, but by 30 to 60 days still remained much lower than before transplant. Neutrophils transiently decreased in 13 of 16 patients (median decrease, 42%) within 24 to 72 hours of discontinuing rhGM-CSF infusions. These data suggest that rhGM-CSF therapy enhances neutrophil recovery by forcing stem cells to produce mature elements at an enhanced rate but may not affect marrow stem cell and early progenitor population sizes. \nHemodynamics in the prone jackknife position during surgery. We examined the hemodynamic changes occurring with prone jackknife positioning during colorectal surgery. The operative procedure was restorative proctocolectomy with ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis in five patients with adenomatosis coli and six patients with ulcerative colitis and anoabdominal resection of the rectum with colonic J-pouch anal anastomosis in eight patients with rectal cancer. Nineteen patients (10 men and 9 women aged 41 +/- 19 years) were monitored with arterial and Swan-Ganz catheters during positioning. Measurements were obtained in the supine and prone positions (1 minute, 3 minutes), and the jackknife position (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes), as well as before and after adoption of the Lloyd-Davies position (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes). Turning the patient from the supine position to the prone position resulted in a significant decrease in the cardiac index (CI). However, following head-down rotation, the CI increased and returned to the value seen in the supine position (p less than 0.05). Heart rate (HR) slowed and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased in the prone jackknife position. We concluded that the extent of the changes in cardiac function presented no serious problems. \nImpassable ureteral strictures: management with percutaneous ureteroneocystostomy. Sixteen of 227 patients referred for percutaneous placement of a ureteral stent had impassable stenoses. Stenoses were benign (n = 8) or attributed to malignant retroperitoneal neoplasm (n = 8). Electrocautery was used to create a neotract between the stenosed ureter and the bladder or ileal loop. A double-J stent was placed after dilation of the tract by use of angioplasty. Neotracts were established and stents were placed in all patients. Complications (digestive tract fistulas) developed in two patients. This technique is safe if the electrode is placed close to the bladder or ileal loop. The procedure can be used as an alternative to surgery or permanent nephrostomy or in initial treatment of benign anastomotic stenosis. \nEffect of granulocytopenia on oral microbial relationships in patients with acute leukemia. Risk for acute infection increases as granulocyte levels decrease secondary to myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Acute exacerbations of concomitant inflammatory periodontal diseases can result in systemic infections in these patients. However, host-oral bacterial relationships in the periodontium in patients with ANLL are not well understood. Twenty-one adult patients with ANLL with periodontal disease ranging from gingivitis to severe periodontitis were studied. Supragingival and subgingival plaque specimens were collected before chemotherapy (prechemotherapy), and at a defined midpoint of myelosuppression (midchemotherapy; day 14). All specimens were extensively cultured both aerobically and anaerobically. Data were submitted to a partial correlational analysis, controlling for covariation relation to oral hygiene intervention and antibiotic administration. Levels of total yeast exhibited a significant association with Staphylococcus sp. at supragingival sites midchemotherapy (r = 0.68, p less than or equal to 0.05). Levels of total yeast also correlated positively with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at subgingival sites both prechemotherapy (r = 0.70, p less than or equal to 0.01) and midchemotherapy (r = 0.61, p less than or equal to 0.05). Significant correlations of levels of Veillonella sp. with Neisseria sp. and gram-negative enteric bacilli were observed in both supragingival (r = 0.95, 0.77, p values less than or equal to 0.01) and subgingival (r = 0.69, 0.61, p values less than or equal to 0.05) plaque specimens midchemotherapy but not prechemotherapy. These data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria occur in plaque simultaneous with granulocytopenia in these patients. Multiple mechanisms, including intergeneric coaggregation and other symbiotic relationships, may influence infectivity of the mixed plaque flora and thus contribute to the oral ecology observed in these patients. \nThe effect of nicardipine on vasospasm in rabbit basilar artery after subarachnoid hemorrhage. This study was performed to examine the effect of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, nicardipine, on vasospasm after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the rabbit. The study was carried out in two parts: 1) effect of intravenous nicardipine (n = 45) and 2) effect of intracisternal nicardipine (n = 21). SAH was induced by injecting 5 ml of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna. In the intravenous study, there were five groups: 1) SAH without treatment; 2) SAH with vehicle (saline); 3) SAH and intravenous infusion of low-dose nicardipine (0.01 mg/kg/h); 4) SAH and intravenous infusion of high-dose nicardipine (0.15 mg/kg/h); and 5) controls without SAH. The intravenous infusions were started immediately after SAH and continued for 48 hours until death. In the intracisternal study, there were three groups: 1) SAH without treatment; 2) SAH with intracisternal administration of nicardipine (0.37 mg/h); and 3) controls without SAH. Intracisternal infusions were begun 70 hours after SAH and continued for 2 hours until death. After perfusion-fixation, the basilar artery was removed and processed for morphometric analysis. In the intravenous study, vessels from animals subjected to SAH were significantly narrowed when compared with controls, although after high-dose nicardipine vessel caliber was slightly larger than in the other SAH groups. Animals given intracisternal nicardipine showed a nonsignificant reduction of caliber as compared with controls: only 12% decrease in diameter and 22% decrease in luminal area. In the rabbit SAH model, nicardipine had a very modest effect on vasospasm at the doses tested. \nRegression of carotid plaques during low density lipoprotein cholesterol elimination. We performed serial prospective ultrasound examinations of four flat and 17 soft carotid plaques during an average of 17 months in seven patients with heterozygous hypercholesterolemia during heparin-induced extracorporeal low density lipoprotein elimination on precipitation from plasma. By means of a specially designed quantitative three-dimensional ultrasound analysis, significant plaque volume reduction could be evaluated in all subjects, along with a marked reduction of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and fibrinogen serum levels. \nDipyridamole thallium scanning in the evaluation of coronary artery disease in elective abdominal aortic surgery. Dipyridamole thallium scanning was routinely performed on 68 consecutive patients who presented for elective aortic surgery. All 68 patients were judged by clinical assessment to be at low risk for perioperative cardiac complications. In addition, 42 of 68 patients had a history of myocardial infarction, stable angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 1). Twenty-six of 68 patients did not have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 2). In group 1, 34 of 4 patients had positive results on dipyridamole thallium scanning, and 15 of these patients were found to have critical coronary artery disease on subsequent cardiac catheterization; nine underwent immediate coronary artery bypass grafting, and six had their coronary artery disease treated medically and their vascular operations cancelled. The remaining 27 patients in group 1 underwent elective operations, with six (22%) of 27 sustaining postoperative cardiac complications. None of the group 2 patients was found to have critical coronary artery disease. All patients in group 2 underwent aortic operation without cardiac complication. Routine dipyridamole thallium scanning detected a 22% (15 of 68) incidence of critical coronary artery disease overall. There was a 36% (15 of 42) incidence of critical coronary artery disease in group 1 patients vs 0% in group 2 patients (95% confidence interval, 21% to 50%). We conclude that the use of dipyridamole thallium scanning in low-risk patients for cardiac screening prior to elective aortic operations is beneficial in selected patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings, but is not necessary in patients with no history of coronary artery disease. \nResults of the Duhamel operation in the treatment of idiopathic megarectum and megacolon. The results of the Duhamel operation in patients with idiopathic megarectum and megacolon have been reviewed. Twenty patients (14 males, six females) underwent the Duhamel operation over a 17-year period for this condition. The mean age at operation was 25 years; the mean age of onset of constipation was 3 years; and the mean follow-up period was 4.5 years. All the resected colons were of enlarged diameter. There was agreement between the preoperative radiographs and the operative specimens with regard to which parts of the rectum and colon were dilated. Subjective feelings of well-being were generally improved by surgery, as was bowel frequency in ten patients. Soiling, straining, abdominal pain and distension were, however, common after operation. Early complications were also common and five patients required further surgery for constipation. The Duhamel operation for megarectum and megacolon is characterized by an improved sense of well-being and improved bowel frequency, but it is associated with the persistence of many symptoms and further surgery is often required. \nRenal pelvic explosion during conservative management of upper tract urothelial cancer. Ureteroscopic fulguration of a renal pelvic papillary transitional cell carcinoma is a relatively new and limited procedure. We present a case of intrarenal explosion during ureteroscopic fulguration. \nEffect of hyaluronic acid on postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion formation in the rat model. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid solution in preventing intraperitoneal (IP) adhesions. DESIGN AND SETTING: The study design was prospective, randomized and blinded and involved 83 rats. INTERVENTIONS: Measured serosal injury was inflicted using a CO2 laser on the right uterine horn of the rat. Animals randomized to groups 1 and 2 received either 0.4% hyaluronic acid or its diluent phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) intraperitoneally before and after the injury. In groups 3 and 4, the same solutions were used only after the injury. Postoperative adhesions were assessed at second-look laparotomy. Histologic assessment of the fresh laser injury was carried out on uteri pretreated with hyaluronic acid, PBS, or nothing. MAIN OUTCOME: Pretreatment with hyaluronic acid was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative adhesions and a significantly decreased crater depth. CONCLUSIONS: Hyaluronic acid appears to reduce postoperative IP adhesion formation by coating the serosal surfaces and decreasing the extent of initial tissue injury. \nAdrenal hemangioma: an unusual adrenal mass delineated with magnetic resonance imaging. Adrenal hemangioma should be included in the differential diagnosis of any large calcified adrenal mass. We report to our knowledge the eighth surgically removed lesion and describe its appearance on magnetic resonance imaging. This imaging includes features seen in hemangiomas elsewhere, in particular a heterogeneous mass with enhancing peripheral high intensity foci on T1 images. \nEffects of a moderate dose of alcohol on blood lipids and lipoproteins postprandially and in the fasting state. Effects of a moderate dose of alcohol on blood lipids and lipoproteins were studied in volunteers of two age groups (20-30 and 45-55 years), each consisting of eight healthy men. The alcohol (30 g in red port and wine) was consumed during a standard dinner. Two blood samples were drawn: one in the postprandial phase, and one the next morning after fasting overnight. In the postprandial phase, one hour after intake, alcohol increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by 11.5%, triglycerides (TG) by 15.3% and apolipoprotein A2 (Apo-A2) by 7.3% (P = 0.002, P = 0.044 and P = 0.024, respectively). The increase in HDL-C appeared to be mainly attributed to the HDL2-C subfraction which increased by 15.3% (P = 0.066). Furthermore, the increases in HDL-C, HDL2-C and TG were more pronounced in the middle-aged men then in the young men. After fasting overnight the effects of alcohol had disappeared. \nSubdiaphragmatic extralobar pulmonary sequestration. A 21-day-old girl presented with a left subdiaphragmatic retroperitoneal mass discovered on maternal ultrasound at 23 weeks' gestation. The clinical impression was neuroblastoma, and preoperative workup showed no for metastatic disease. Histologically, the lesion proved to be an extralobar pulmonary sequestration. We present this case to remind pathologists of the occurrence of subdiaphragmatic pulmonary sequestration and its potential clinical confusion with other more familiar lesions that may occur in this location in a neonate. \nPrimary ocular malignant lymphoma associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A 42-year-old man who was human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive complained of floaters in his right eye, which had existed for 1 week, followed by loss of central vision. Results of ophthalmoscopic examination disclosed confluent yellowish-white retinochoroidal infiltrates with perivascular sheathing, which were more prominent superiorly in the right eye. Approximately 10 small, white, intraretinal and choroidal lesions were observed in the nasal periphery of the left eye. Results of cytologic examination of the vitreous of the right eye showed neoplastic cells characteristic of large cell type malignant lymphoma. Shortly thereafter, cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid also showed large cell malignant lymphoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass involving the left cerebellar hemisphere. After bilateral whole-eye radiation therapy, there was complete resolution of the lymphomatous retinochoroidal infiltrates in both eyes. The ophthalmologic and neurologic manifestations of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are discussed. The authors believe this is the first report of ocular malignant lymphoma occurring in a patient with AIDS. \nFacial nerve monitoring in acoustic tumor surgery. Anatomic and functional preservation of the facial nerve during acoustic tumor surgery remains a primary goal. Intraoperative electromyographic facial nerve monitoring with auditory feedback has enabled the surgeon to more readily achieve this goal. We compared a group of monitored translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removals (N = 89) to a similar unmonitored group (N = 155) in regard to facial nerve function. Function was assessed immediately postoperatively, at time of discharge, and at 1 year postoperatively using the House six-point scale. Results were grouped as satisfactory, intermediate, or poor and were analyzed by tumor size. Facial nerve results were better at all time intervals in the monitored groups, although the difference was not statistically significant at the 1-year interval. There was no difference between monitored and unmonitored patients in the subgroups with tumors smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter. This study supports the usefulness of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring in improving facial nerve results, particularly in larger tumors. \nUltrasonographical investigation of periportal fibrosis in children with Schistosoma mansoni infection: reversibility of morbidity seven months after treatment with praziquantel. Five hundred thirty six Sudanese schoolchildren with Schistosoma mansoni infection were treated at random with either 20 mg or 40 mg/kg praziquantel. Seven months later 420 children could be reinvestigated by ultrasonography. Reduction of egg excretion and reversibility of sonographically-proven periportal fibrosis (PF) was not significantly different in the two groups. Schistosoma mansoni-induced PF grade II decreased from 22.9% to 6.7% and grade III from 5.2% to 1.6%. An increased prevalence of PF grade I, from 10% to 29.8% of the investigated patients, was observed. This increase was caused partly by a downshifting of patients who had PF II (n = 45) and PF III (n = 8) before therapy, but also by patients who developed PF I in the seven months after therapy (n = 56). The overall percentage of patients with PF before and after treatment was 38.1%. Of 420 children, 17.4% increased in their PF grade, 55% remained at the same level and 27.6% improved. Children younger than 11 years of age had a higher rate of complete reversibility than older ones. The percentage of patients with hepatomegaly decreased significantly (11.6% to 6.9%; p = 0.001). The rate of splenomegaly remained unchanged. It was concluded that within seven months therapy with praziquantel resulted in a considerable qualitative improvement of PF in Sudanese schoolchildren with S. mansoni infection. \nCancer mortality in Cuba and among the Cuban-born in the United States: 1979-81. The Cuban-born population of the United States, enumerated at 608,000 in the 1980 census, has been little studied with regard to cancer mortality. Being older and rarely migrating back to Cuba, Cuban Americans present a good subject for comparative cancer mortality. Age-adjusted death rates for selected causes of cancer are compared in this paper for Cubans in Cuba, the Cuban-born in the United States, and all whites in the United States. Two forms of cancer have been of particular concern in Cuba, cancer of the lung and cancer of the prostate, because of their relatively high death rates. The age-adjusted death rates for both of these cancers are lower among the Cuban-born in the United States than they are among Cubans in Cuba and whites in the United States. Death rates for cancer of the cervix and cancer of the rectum among the Cuban-born in this country are also low relative to Cubans in Cuba and whites in the United States. Stomach cancer mortality among Cuban-born men in the United States is lower than for men in Cuba or for white men in the United States, but Cuban-born women in this country have rates that are slightly higher than those of U.S white women. Mortality rates from colon cancer in both sexes and breast cancer among women are intermediate between the lower rates in Cuba and the higher rates among U.S. whites. Finally, the Cuban-born in the United States have higher death rates from cancer of the liver than do Cubans in Cuba or whites in the United States. \nSPECT, MRI and cognitive functions in multiple sclerosis. Seventeen patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and mild physical disability had neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) using technetium 99m (99mTc) hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO). Performance in verbal fluency, naming and memory testing appeared to be impaired in MS patients compared with 17 age-sex and education matched normal controls. Weighted periventricular and confluent lesion scores and the width of the third ventricle, proved to be the most sensitive MRI measures in differentiating more cognitively impaired patients from those who were relatively unimpaired. Ratios of regional to whole brain activity, measured by SPECT, showed significant reduction in the frontal lobes and in the left temporal lobe of MS patients. A relationship was found between left temporal abnormality in 99mTc-HMPAO uptake and deficit in verbal fluency and verbal memory. Finally, asymmetrical lobar activity indicated a predominant left rather than right temporo-parietal involvement. \nAntihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of enalapril and slow-release verapamil in essential hypertension: a double-blind, cross-over study. The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of enalapril (E) and slow-release verapamil (V) were compared in a 2-month double-blind cross-over study in 22 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After 1 month, significantly lower systolic (P less than 0.01) and diastolic (P less than 0.02) blood pressures (BP) were achieved with E, 20 mg d-1, compared with V, 240 mg d-1. After 2 months of treatment, BP reductions were similar after E, 40 mg d-1, and V, 240 mg twice a day. The fall in supine mean BP after 2 months of treatment with V was significantly greater in patients aged greater than or equal to 50 years of age (P = 0.02) (median 18 mmHg) than in patients aged less than 50 years (10 mmHg). E showed similar effectiveness in both age groups. Statistical group analysis of a quality-of-life questionnaire showed no significant differences between the active drugs and the placebo. It is concluded that E and V are equally effective as antihypertensive agents, and that both drugs are well tolerated. \nThermal laser-assisted balloon angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery: a multicenter review of 602 cases. A multicenter review of 602 procedures was performed to evaluate the effects of thermal laser-assisted balloon angioplasty on the superficial femoral artery. Four hundred thirty-nine (73%) patients underwent laser-assisted balloon angioplasty for claudication, and 163 (27%) underwent the procedure for limb salvage. Two hundred ninety-two laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures were performed for multifocal stenotic disease (greater than 80%) diameter reduction), 258 for total occlusion, and 52 procedures for both superficial femoral artery stenosis and occlusion. The initial recanalization rate was 89% (538/602) depending on the length of the lesion. Success of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty was verified by angioscopy or arteriography, and all patients underwent segmental Doppler studies before discharge and during midterm follow-up extending to 30 months (mean, 11.3 months). Complications occurred in 62 (10%) patients, but only one limb amputation occurred because of a complication related to a laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. Overall, 60% of initially successful procedures have remained patent, but long segment (greater than 7 cm) occlusions have fared poorly (25% patency at 30 months). This minimally invasive technology affords the opportunity to treat short segment (less than 7 cm) symptomatic superficial femoral artery occlusive disease with minimal risk. Initial success and midterm patency rates for appropriate lesions appear to make laser-assisted balloon angioplasty a viable adjunct in the treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease. \nSmoking-attributable cancer mortality in 1991: is lung cancer now the leading cause of death among smokers in the United States? Findings from the new American Cancer Society prospective study of 1.2 million men and women indicate that mortality risks among smokers have increased substantially for most of the eight major cancer sites causally associated with cigarette smoking. Lung cancer risk for male smokers doubled, while the risk for females increased more than fourfold. On the basis of the new American Cancer Society relative risks, we project that cigarette smoking alone will contribute to slightly more than 157,000 of the 514,000 total cancer deaths expected to occur in the United States in 1991. Overall, smoking directly contributes to 21.5% of all cancer deaths in women but 45% of all cancer deaths in men. It would also appear that lung cancer has now displaced coronary heart disease as the single leading cause of excess mortality among smokers in the United States. \nReentrant excitation around a fixed obstacle in uniform anisotropic ventricular myocardium BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of tissue anisotropy and dispersion of refractoriness on initiation of reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT). METHODS AND RESULTS. A ring of perfused uniform anisotropic ventricular epicardium in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts was created by an endocardial freezing technique. High-resolution mapping (248 channels) was used to analyze epicardial activation of the left ventricle. One to three premature beats were induced at a total of 272 points in 17 experiments (16 different points around the ring in each experiment). Reentrant VT could be initiated at 43 of the 272 points tested. The cycle length of VT was stable and ranged from 128 to 198 msec (mean, 161 +/- 19 msec). Correlation between conduction velocity and the angle between the circulating activation wave and epicardial fiber orientation showed that in segments of the ring where conduction was perpendicular to the fiber axis, mean conduction velocity was 25 +/- 5 cm/sec compared with 60 +/- 7 cm/sec when conduction was parallel to the fiber orientation. Analysis of the site of unidirectional conduction block showed that in 41 of 43 cases, block occurred while the impulse was propagating parallel to the fiber orientation. Measurement of the refractory periods at either side of the line of unidirectional block showed that only in 12 of 43 cases did block occur while the impulse was propagating into an area with a longer (more than 10 msec) refractory period. CONCLUSIONS. In uniform anisotropic ventricular myocardium, reentrant VT is initiated because lowering the stimulating efficacy of the depolarization wave by premature beats leads to preferential conduction block parallel to the fiber orientation. \nPharmacologic treatment of heart failure. An increased understanding of the pathophysiologic changes underlying CHF, advanced monitoring technology, and a wider array of drug therapy have improved the prognosis of patients with this disorder. These advances allow for greater individualization of therapy, improve patient compliance, and lower the incidence of undesirable side effects. Of course, with the increase in complexity of treatment choices comes the need for more knowledgeable practitioners who can select the most appropriate therapeutic approach. All practitioners also must make every effort to educate the patients about their disease, treatments, and necessary lifestyle changes so that optimal benefits can be realized. \nSubglottic cyst in a newborn. Subglottic laryngeal cysts in the newborn are extremely rare. It is difficult to establish if the cyst is acquired or congenital because respiratory distress requires intubation in the I.C.U. generally without prior endoscopy. A case report is presented, followed by a discussion of possible aetiology and management protocol; the advantages of the CO2 laser make excision of the cystic sac possible without tracheotomy. \nSeroepidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection in India. Comparison of developing and developed countries. Helicobacter pylori (previously Campylobacter pylori) is now accepted as the major cause of type B gastritis and thus what is known about the epidemiology of type B gastritis can reasonably be transferred to H. pylori. We used a specific ELISA for anti-H. pylori IgG to study the prevalence of H. pylori infection in a population of lower socioeconomic class from Hyderabad, India. The results from India were compared to studies from other parts of the world. Two hundred thirty-eight individuals ages 3 to 70 participated. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased with age (P less than 0.01) and was greater than 80% by age 20. H. pylori infection was present in 79% of the population studied; there was no gender-related difference in prevalence of H. pylori infection. IgG antibody against hepatitis A (HAV) was rapidly acquired in Hyderabad; in a subset of 58 children between the ages of 3 and 21 tested, the frequency of anti-HAV was 98.2%. The prevalence of H. pylori infection increases with age in both developed and developing countries. The high age-specific prevalence of H. pylori infection in developing countries is probably a reflection of the lower socioeconomic level of those areas. \nSystemic and splanchnic hemodynamic effects of molsidomine in rats ",
