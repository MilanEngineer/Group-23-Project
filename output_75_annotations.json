The frequency of ischaemic episodes was not reduced with either regimen nor was the circadian distribution of these episodes altered, in particular nocturnal episodes did not increase during intermittent treatment. CONCLUSION--Tolerance to glyceryl trinitrate was avoided by the use of individually titrated doses administered with a nocturnal nitrate free period. There was no evidence of \"rebound\" on ambulatory monitoring during this treatment. \nPhysiologic stress and cellular ischemia: relationship to immunosuppression and susceptibility to sepsis. Multiple organ system failure secondary to infection is the most frequent cause of late mortality after hemorrhage, burns, and trauma. Although multiple immunologic abnormalities have been identified following injury, blood loss, and tissue ischemia, the mechanisms that produce these alterations in T- and B-cell function have not been completely defined. Physiologic stress and ischemia result in increased release of neuroendocrine peptides and hormones, capable of affecting normal neuroendocrine-immunologic balance and producing immunosuppression. Tissue ischemia leads to increased expression of heat shock proteins by hypoperfused cells, which can alter T-cell function. Injury also is followed by the appearance of serum immunosuppressive factors, which have been shown to inhibit T- and B-cell function. Future therapies directed at these and other cellular and molecular abnormalities initiated by tissue hypoperfusion may reverse the immunosuppressed state in critically ill patients and lead to improved outcome in this setting. \nIs routine CT scanning necessary in the preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy? To evaluate the usefulness of CT scanning before carotid endarterectomy, a prospective study was performed on 469 consecutive patients considered for carotid endarterectomy during a 5-year period. All patients underwent carotid duplex scanning and CT scanning before carotid arteriography. Two hundred thirty-seven patients (51%) had transient ischemic attacks, 109 (23%) had a prior stroke, and 122 (26%) were asymptomatic. Results of the CT scan were abnormal in 68 (62%) of the 109 patients with stroke. Fifty-one of the 360 patients (14%) without a clinical history of stroke had an abnormal CT scan outcome. Of patients with a stroke documented by CT scanning, 27 had lacunar infarcts, and 92 had cortical infarcts; these findings did not change surgical management in any patient. CT scanning did not reveal any unsuspected infarcts or tumors. Two hundred thirty carotid endarterectomies were performed on 206 patients. Forty-seven patients (23%) in the operative group had abnormal CT scan findings, but the scan did not influence operative decisions or timing in any case. Seventy-two patients (27%) in the nonoperative group had abnormal CT scan results, but CT scan findings did not exclude any patient from arteriography or surgery. Three perioperative strokes (1.3%) occurred. CT scan findings did not correlate with postoperative neurologic complications. Cost of CT scanning was one-half million dollars in our study alone. Routine CT scanning is unnecessary before carotid endarterectomy and is not cost-effective. \nDouble dissociation of short-term and long-term memory for nonverbal material in Parkinson's disease and global amnesia. A further analysis. The traditional concept of memory disorder is deficiency of the long-term (LTM) but not short-term (STM) component of memory. STM impairment with LTM sparing is seldom reported. The present study investigated STM and LTM for nonverbal material in three neurological conditions associated with memory impairment: bilateral medial temporal lobe lesions (patient H.M.), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects received 3 tests of nonverbal memory: forward block span, immediate and delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale drawings, and immediate and delayed recognition of abstract designs. Compared with the normal control group, the patient groups displayed different patterns of sparing and loss of the two components of memory: in PD, only STM was impaired; in medial temporal lobe amnesia, only LTM was impaired; and in AD, STM and LTM were both impaired. The contrasting patterns of sparing and loss of STM and LTM in PD and global amnesia were present for both recognition and recall. These results provide evidence that STM and LTM are dissociable processes and are served by separate neurological systems: STM depends upon intact corticostriatal systems, whereas LTM depends upon intact medial temporal lobe systems. \nTraumatic anterior fossa cerebrospinal fluid fistulae and craniofacial considerations. Traumatic cerebrospinal fluid fistulae may present a diagnostic and treatment challenge to the head and neck surgeon. The clinical presentation may be obscured by associated injuries. This article serves as a guide in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of patients with dural fistulae of the anterior cranial fossa. \nMorphologic features and nuclide composition of infarction-associated cardiac myocyte mineralization in humans. Low dietary Mg results in Ca loading of cardiac myocytes, which increases the likelihood of myocyte calcification in the event of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and possibly increases myocyte vulnerability to necrosis. Bloom and Peric-Golia1 previously reported an autopsy study of cases from the Washington, D.C. area (a region with low levels of Mg in the drinking water), demonstrating AMI-associated mineralization in myocytes with histologically normal nuclei and cross striations, as well as in obviously necrotic myocytes. The authors have re-examined mineralized myocytes from the same autopsy material, using electron probe microanalysis, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Microprobe analysis identified Ca and P as the nuclides composing the inorganic phase of the mineral deposits. Ultrastructurally, all Ca deposits, regardless of size or intracellular location, were composed of aggregates of needlelike hydroxyapatite crystals. The mildest form of intracellular Ca deposition was observed as small Ca deposits limited to some mitochondria of myocytes, which demonstrated intact nuclei and regular sarcomere pattern. More advanced stages of intracellular calcification, in the form of Ca deposits associated with mitochondria, Z-band regions and nuclei, were observed in other myocytes that also retained intact nuclei and sarcomeres. Massive Ca deposits were associated with myocytes which showed morphologic features of advanced necrosis, including loss of nuclei, disruption of sarcomere structure and masses of cellular debris. These observations support the theory originally proposed by Bloom and Peric-Golia1 suggesting that Ca loading of myocytes, possibly related to Mg deficiency in humans, increased vulnerability of the myocytes to subsequent AMI-associated necrosis and dystrophic calcification. In addition, the light microscopic impression of calcification of otherwise normal myocytes is contradicted by the electron microscopic identification of hydroxyapatite crystals free in the sarcoplasm, a condition unlikely to be compatible with viability. Lastly, the fact that all Ca deposits were in the form of hydroxyapatite supports the view that they were formed in a Mg-poor environment, which favors conversion of the more common amorphous form of Ca phosphate into the needlelike crystals of hydroxyapatite. \nBacterial meningitis: T cell activation and immunoregulatory CD4+ T cell subset alteration. Meningitis is the most important cause of acquired postnatal deafness and neurologic disorders in children. To determine if cell-mediated immunity is casually related to the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis, T cell subsets were quantitated from blood of the 29 children with clinical and bacteriologic diagnosis of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis bacterial meningitis. The CD4+ T cells increased and CD8+ T cells decreased in patients with meningitis as compared to patient control subjects (bacterial infections without meningitis) and normal healthy control subjects. An elevated percentage of CD25+ (interleukin-2 receptors) and HLA-DR+ (immune-response gene-associated antigen) T cells were detected from all patients with meningitis. All 29 patients with meningitis had highly elevated CD4+ CD45R+ (suppressor-inducer) cells and reciprocally depressed CD4+ CDw29+ (helper-inducer) cells compared with healthy age-matched normal and patient control subjects. These findings indicate characteristic immunologic T cell abnormalities from meningitis. The abnormal increase in the CD4+ CD45R+ suppressor-inducer or \"virgin\" cells and expression of activation antigens on T cells may be of help in future understanding of abnormal immune reactions from bacterial meningitis. However, deficiency of the CD4+ CDw29+ helper-inducer or \"memory\" cells may contribute to the impaired helper function for B cell-induced protective antibody synthesis to bacterial capsular polysaccharides found in this disease. \nAndrogen responses to acutely increased endogenous insulin levels in hyperandrogenic and normal cycling women. We examined androgen responses in hyperandrogenic (polycystic ovarian disease [PCOD]) and normal women after an acute endogenous insulin elevation. Standard intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs), modified to include a tolbutamide injection 20 minutes after IVGTTs, were performed. Polycystic ovarian disease patients were studied in the untreated state, after 6 weeks of ovarian androgen suppression with leuprolide acetate, after a 6-week rest period, and after 6 weeks of antiandrogen therapy with spironolactone. Normal menstruating women were studied during the early follicular, midcycle, and luteal phases of a single cycle. An acute rise in insulin did not alter serum testosterone or androstenedione levels in PCOD or normal women. A significant rise in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate after modified IVGTTs was found in both hyperandrogenic and normal cycling women. Although these results are not supportive of the theory that insulin acts on the ovary to stimulate androgen production, they may be because of the short time course of insulin elevation that occurs during an IVGTT. \nHypersensitivity myocarditis. Autopsy tissue specimens of 69 cases of hypersensitivity myocarditis were studied to determine drug association, spectrum of histologic findings, distribution of infiltrates, and correlation between degree of infiltrates and cardiac symptoms. Hypersensitivity myocarditis was defined by the presence of eosinophils, a mixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate along natural planes of separation, and an absence of fibrosis or granulation tissue in areas of infiltrate. Commonly implicated drugs were methyldopa, hydrochlorothiazide, ampicillin, furosemide, digoxin, tetracycline, aminophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants. Histiocytes composed the predominant cell type (in addition to eosinophils and lymphocytes). Lymphocytes were predominantly T cells in 12 cases studied immunohistochemically. Small foci of myocyte necrosis were present in 37 cases, and they correlated with the degree of infiltrate. A nonnecrotizing vasculitis was present in 28 cases. The right ventricle was involved in all but three cases. Cardiac arrhythmias or unexplained death occurred in 29 patients and did not correlate with the degree of myocardial infiltrate or presence of necrosis. Eosinophils were present in the livers of 30 of 58 patients, and their presence correlated with the degree of cardiac infiltration. A causative association between histologic findings and drugs is difficult to prove because of the common usage of many of the drugs implicated, multiple drug use, and the absence of clinical criteria of hypersensitivity. Symptoms do not appear related to the degree of infiltrate. In more than half the cases, infiltrates may be missed by endomyocardial biopsy due to focality of lesions. \n5-Fluorouracil after trabeculectomy and the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. Nine patients (nine eyes) with iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome underwent trabeculectomy and received postoperative subconjunctival injections of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to enhance bleb formation (total 5-FU dose, 30-105 mg; mean, 53.8 mg). Eight eyes had undergone prior unsuccessful trabeculectomy. Four eyes had intraocular pressure (IOP) less than or equal to 21 mmHg on zero to two glaucoma medications after 6 to 54 months of follow-up (mean, 25.3 months). Five eyes required repeat surgery within 2 to 13 months and were considered failures. All five eyes that failed received a Molteno drainage implant. Progressive endothelial proliferation may explain late onset bleb failure and the relative ineffectiveness of 5-FU in this condition. \nChanges in portal blood flow consequent to partial hepatectomy: Doppler estimation. Hemodynamic changes in portal blood flow were investigated in 56 patients with hepatic tumors who underwent partial hepatectomy. Portal flow was measured with a Doppler ultrasound system before, during, and after surgery. The portal flow of patients who underwent massive hepatectomy decreased intraoperatively. The portal flow per unit of cardiac output decreased in patients who underwent massive or major hepatectomy, patients with a cirrhotic liver, and patients who had a satisfactory postoperative course. Postoperatively, the portal flow in patients with a poor clinical outcome (multiple organ failure, hepatic failure, and cardiorespiratory failure) decreased significantly. Monitoring portal hemodynamic values appears to be useful in providing an index of \"hepatic functional reserve.\" Adequate portal flow is essential for postoperative hepatic regeneration; changes in portal hemodynamic values may be directly related to the patient's ability to survive surgery and to regain or maintain normal liver function. \nAngiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and magnesium conservation in patients with congestive cardiac failure. OBJECTIVE--To investigate whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce diuretic induced magnesium excretion in patients in congestive cardiac failure. DESIGN--Cohort analytic study. SETTING--A London district general hospital. SUBJECTS--Thirty four patients with chronic congestive cardiac failure caused by ischaemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy selected consecutively from inpatients under the care of two consultant cardiologists. Nineteen patients (group 1) on diuretics alone were compared with 15 patients (group 2) taking diuretics plus either enalapril or captopril. All drug regimens were stable for at least three months before the study. Patients with impaired renal function (plasma creatinine greater than 120 mumol/l) were excluded. INTERVENTIONS--An intravenous loading dose of magnesium sulphate was given to minimise the variability in baseline magnesium state. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Total urine magnesium excretion and creatinine clearance in 24 hour urine collections. RESULTS--Plasma magnesium was similar in the two groups. However, 24 hour urine magnesium excretion was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1. Furthermore, creatinine clearance was also significantly lower in group 2 and correlated strongly with magnesium excretion. There was no such relation in group 1. There was no difference in fractional clearance of magnesium between groups. CONCLUSION--Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have an important magnesium conserving action, possibly via their effect on glomerular filtration rate. \nDiagnostic x-ray procedures and risk of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Jun 5;265(21):2810] Exposure to diagnostic x-rays and the risk of leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and multiple myeloma were studied within two prepaid health plans. Adult patients with leukemia (n = 565), NHL (n = 318), and multiple myeloma (n = 208) were matched to controls (n = 1390), and over 25,000 x-ray procedures were abstracted from medical records. Dose response was evaluated by assigning each x-ray procedure a score based on estimated bone marrow dose. X-ray exposure was not associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one of the few malignant conditions never linked to radiation (relative risk [RR], 0.66). For all other forms of leukemia combined (n = 358), there was a slight elevation in risk (RR, 1.17) but no evidence of a dose-response relationship when x-ray procedures near the time of diagnosis were excluded. Similarly, patients with NHL were exposed to diagnostic x-ray procedures more often than controls (RR, 1.32), but the RR fell to 0.99 when the exposure to diagnostic x-ray procedures within 2 years of diagnosis was ignored. For multiple myeloma, overall risk was not significantly high (RR, 1.14), but there was consistent evidence of increasing risk with increasing numbers of diagnostic x-ray procedures. These data suggest that persons with leukemia and NHL undergo x-ray procedures frequently just prior to diagnosis for conditions related to the development or natural history of their disease. There was little evidence that diagnostic x-ray procedures were causally associated with leukemia or NHL. The risk for multiple myeloma, however, was increased among those patients who were frequently exposed to x-rays. \nUrological aspects of Behcet's disease. Behcet's disease, affecting mostly young males in the Mediterranean countries and Japan, is a multi-system disease with urological manifestations. In this prospective study of 100 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed Behcet's disease, we found that 89% of the males had experienced scrotal ulceration and 6% had epididymitis. We also observed sterile urethritis in 3%. Other urological abnormalities appeared to be coincidental findings. \nA randomized trial of five cisplatin-containing treatments in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a Southwest Oncology Group study. Six hundred eighty assessable patients with measureable stage III M1, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomized to one of five treatment arms including cisplatin, etoposide (VP-16) +/- methylglyoxal bisguanylhydrazone (MGBG; PVp, PVpM); cisplatin, vinblastine (PVe); or PVe alternating with vinblastine, mitomycin (PVeMi); or fluorouracil, vincristine, mitomycin/cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin (FOMi/CAP). The overall response rate was 20% with 3% complete responses and 17% partial remissions. The duration of these responses was not statistically different by treatment regimen and varied from 2.7 months to 5.0 months. The overall median survival for all patients was 5.3 months and is not different by treatment. Toxicity was greater in PVpM. The similarity of results for response, duration of response, and survival does not establish the superiority of any of these platinum-based regimens for standard clinical usage. \nDid prognosis after acute myocardial infarction change during the past 30 years? A meta-analysis. Much effort has been spent to improve survival after acute myocardial infarction. To investigate how effective this effort has been, a meta-analysis was performed of studies published between 1960 and 1987 concerning mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Thirty-six studies were analyzed. They were classified with respect to deaths in the hospital and at 1 month and the 5-year mortality rate starting at hospital discharge. Mortality was assessed from all studies by comparing studies from different institutions with use of identical inclusion criteria (externally controlled studies) and by analyzing studies reporting on changes in mortality in two or more comparable patient cohorts admitted to the same institution at different time periods (internally controlled studies). Reports on clinical trials (for example, thrombolytic therapy, beta-adrenergic blockade) in acute myocardial infarction were excluded. Average overall in-hospital mortality decreased from 29% during the 1960s to 21% during the 1970s and to 16% during the 1980s. The externally controlled studies also showed a declining trend: from 1960 to 1969, 32%, from 1970 to 1979, 19% and from 1980 to 1987, 15%. The 1-month overall mortality rate decreased from 31% during the 1960s to 25% during the 1970s and 18% during the 1980s externally controlled studies. Most internally controlled studies also showed significant improvement in in-hospital and 1-month survival. In contrast, 5-year mortality after hospital discharge did not significantly decrease (33% from 1960 to 1969 and 33% from 1970 to 1979). It is concluded that in the prethrombolytic era, short-term prognosis after acute myocardial infarction has improved since 1960. \nDetection of preclinical Parkinson's disease with PET. Putamen 18F-dopa uptake of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms; therefore, positron-emission tomography (PET) can be used to detect preclinical disease in clinically unaffected twins and relatives of patients with PD. Three out of 6 monozygotic and 2 out of 3 dizygotic unaffected PD co-twins have shown reduced putamen 18F-dopa uptake to date. In addition, an intact sibling and a daughter of 1 of 4 siblings with PD both had low putamen 18F-dopa uptake. These preliminary findings suggest there may be a familial component to the etiology of PD. PET can also be used to detect underlying nigral pathology in patients with isolated tremor and patients who become rigid taking dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Patients with familial essential tremor have normal, and those with isolated rest tremor have consistently low, putamen 18F-dopa uptake. Drug-induced parkinsonism is infrequently associated with underlying nigral pathology. \nRecent advances in the treatment of breast cancer. Multidisciplinary efforts have defined a number of prognostic factors and newer strategies to improve the outcome of patients with breast cancer. Conservative surgery has led to improved functional and cosmetic results. The development of a number of effective adjuvant regimens has led to improved survival. In patients with stage I disease, several biological characteristics of tumor have been identified that are associated with increased risk of relapse. A multimodality approach to patients with locally advanced disease and inflammatory cancer has resulted in improved survival. A number of hormonal and cytotoxic drug contaminations can palliate metastatic disease, with a small fraction of patients remaining in extended remission. Dose-intensive programs may lead to further improvements in survival of selected patients with this disease. \nTamoxifen in premenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer: a review. The antiestrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used hormonal therapy for breast cancer. The drug exerts its antiproliferative effects primarily through estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated mechanisms, although other cellular actions may augment tumor inhibition. Clinically, tamoxifen has been less well studied in premenopausal than in postmenopausal patients. The drug has complex endocrine effects that are dependent on the treatment duration and dose, menopausal status, and target organ. In postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, serum estrogen levels remain low, and the normally elevated gonadotropin levels decrease. In contrast, serum estrogen levels are strikingly elevated in many premenopausal women, and gonadotropin concentrations are either unchanged or slightly increased. Large systematic trials in metastatic breast cancer have established tamoxifen as the recommended hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumors. Tamoxifen is also an active agent for premenopausal metastatic disease, and response rates are comparable to those reported for oophorectomy. Clinical experience with tamoxifen in this younger age group, however, is more limited. Few premenopausal women (less than 400) have been included in phase II and phase III trials. Two randomized trials (total of 160 patients) comparing oophorectomy with tamoxifen do not definitively establish therapeutic equivalence, and a survival advantage for either treatment cannot be excluded. Many questions remain concerning the appropriate role for tamoxifen in premenopausal patients. Still, tamoxifen has an attractive toxicity profile, and it offers a favorable therapeutic alternative for premenopausal women with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer who wish to avoid surgical or radiation castration. \nStructure and expression of the cDNA encoding human neutrophil collagenase. We have isolated and characterized a 2.4-kb cDNA clone encoding human neutrophil collagenase (HNC), a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases restricted to secondary granules within neutrophils. Partial amino acid sequence was used to deduce oligonucleotide probes. These probes were used to screen a human granulocyte cDNA library derived from messenger RNA (mRNA) from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia. Cell-free translation of RNA produced from the cDNA produced a 52-Kd protein that was recognized by anti-HNC antibody. The cDNA clone was sequenced and shown to encode a 467-residue protein whose sequence matched those regions currently known for HNC. The enzyme exhibits 58% homology to human fibroblast collagenase and has the same domain structure. It consists of a 20-residue signal peptide, and an 80-residue propeptide that is lost on autolytic activation by cleavage of an M-L bond. Other regions identified include the autolytic degradation site, the \"cysteine switch\" residue that is involved in latency and activation, and a putative zinc binding sequence. HNC has six potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The cDNA hybridized to a 3.4-kb mRNA in RNA from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia, but not to RNA from uninduced HL60 cells or HL60 cells that had been induced to undergo granulocytic or monocytic maturation with dimethyl sulfoxide or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, respectively. These results parallel those seen with lactoferrin and transcobalamin I, two other secondary granule proteins. \nTreatment of chronic pain by epidural spinal cord stimulation: a 10-year experience. Epidural spinal cord stimulation by means of chronically implanted electrodes was carried out on 121 patients with pain of varied benign organic etiology. In 116 patients, the pain was confined to the back and lower extremities and, of these, 56 exhibited the failed-back syndrome. Most patients were referred by a pain management service because of failure of conventional pain treatment modalities. Electrodes were implanted at varying sites, dictated by the location of pain. A total of 140 epidural implants were used: 76 unipolar, 46 Resume electrodes, 12 bipolar, and six quadripolar. Patients were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to 10 years, with a mean follow-up period of 40 months. Forty-eight patients (40%) were able to control their pain by neurostimulation alone. A further 14 patients (12%), in addition to following a regular stimulation program, needed occasional analgesic supplements to achieve 50% or more relief of the prestimulation pain. Pain secondary to arachnoiditis or perineural fibrosis following multiple intervertebral disc operations, when predominantly confined to one lower extremity, seemed to respond favorably to this treatment. Uniformly good results were also obtained in lower-extremity pain secondary to multiple sclerosis. Pain due to advanced peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs was well controlled, and amputation below the knee was delayed for up to 2 years in some patients. Pain due to cauda equina injury, paraplegic pain, phantom-limb pain, pure midline back pain without radiculopathy, or pain due to primary bone or joint disease seemed to respond less well. Patients who responded to preliminary transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation generally did well with electrode implants. Notable complications included wound infection, electrode displacement or fracturing, and fibrosis at the stimulating tip of the electrode. Three patients in this series died due to unrelated causes. Epidural spinal cord stimulation has proven to be an effective and safe means of controlling pain on a long-term basis in selected groups of patients. The mechanism of action of stimulation-produced analgesia remains unclear; further studies to elucidate it might allow spinal cord stimulation to be exploited more effectively in disorders that are currently refractory to this treatment modality. \nCoronary-heart-disease risk-factor status of the Cretan urban population in the 1980s. The traditional Cretan diet has been associated with low coronary-heart-disease (CHD) mortality rates. This study reports on the prevalence of CHD risk factors among 387 Cretan bank employees. Mean cholesterol concentration has risen by 36% over 26-y; dietary intake has changed: consumption of meat, fish, and cheese has increased and consumption of bread, fruit, and potatoes has decreased. Although the percentage contribution of fat to total energy intake has decreased from 40% to 36%, there has been a reduction in monounsaturated fatty acid consumption and an increase in the consumption of saturated fatty acids whereas the consumption of polyunsaturates has not been altered. Exception for diminished physical activity, the prevalence of other risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, and body mass index) remained relatively stable over this period. These changes in the CHD risk-factor status of the Cretan urban population occurred over a period in which CHD mortality rates are reported to have increased. \nEmergency treatment of headache. Headache is a frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department. Once a diagnosis is established, and significant organic disease can be ruled out, relief of pain must be addressed. Referral for follow-up care and narcotic habituation is a recurrent problem for the emergency physician. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of headache, evaluation of the emergency room patient, and treatment of the patient with headache. \nIsradipine for treatment of acute hypertension after myocardial revascularization. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and duration of action of iv isradipine in the control of postoperative hypertension immediately after myocardial revascularization. DESIGN: Prospective, phase 2 trial. SETTING: Surgical ICU, university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-one (15 male, six female) patients, ages 49 to 75 yr (mean 65 +/- 5), undergoing elective myocardial revascularization. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-one patients with postoperative hypertension after coronary artery bypass graft surgery received iv isradipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonist. Mean duration of the isradipine infusion was 96.9 +/- 29 min. Mean dose of isradipine, indexed to weight, was 16.63 +/- 6.66 micrograms/kg (n = 20). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty of the 21 patients achieved satisfactory BP control. The reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), first noted at the 15-min point, was maximal at 1 hr when MAP decreased from 102 +/- 9 mm Hg baseline to 81 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than .01), accompanied by a significant (p less than .01) decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1753 +/- 339 baseline to 1180 +/- 229 dyne.sec/cm5. The CVP, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure did not change significantly. Heart rate and cardiac index increased; however, stroke volume index did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Isradipine is an acceptable agent for the treatment of hypertension in this setting. \nValue of CT in determining the need for angiography when findings of mediastinal hemorrhage on chest radiographs are equivocal. The role of CT in determining the need for angiography in patients with possible thoracic vascular injury resulting from blunt trauma is controversial. During a 24-month period, we prospectively evaluated the results of CT to screen 90 patients with a history of decelerating thoracic trauma for evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage or great vessel abnormality. All patients either had equivocally abnormal mediastinal contours on chest radiographs (64%) or had technically suboptimal chest radiographs owing to body habitus or restriction to the supine projection (36%). Patients with unequivocal signs of mediastinal hemorrhage on chest radiographs underwent immediate arteriography without prior CT. Thoracic CT was interpreted as normal in 63 (77%) patients and no further imaging was performed. Five patients had technically suboptimal CT studies, and CT scans were interpreted as equivocal in six. These 11 patients had normal arteriograms. Sixteen CT scans (18%) demonstrated evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage and/or great vessel contour abnormality. Four (27%) of 15 patients who underwent arteriography had injury to the great vessels. One patient refused to undergo angiography. In 11 patients with CT evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage, major vascular injury was not seen on arteriography. These results suggest a valuable role for CT in determining the need for arteriography to detect potential great vessel injury in patients with blunt decelerating thoracic trauma and equivocally abnormal mediastinal contours on chest radiographs. \nPercutaneous intraarterial thrombolysis in the treatment of thrombosis of lower extremity arterial reconstructions. Vascular grafts may be salvaged with thrombolytic therapy after acute occlusion as an alternative to balloon catheter thrombectomy. From October 1987 to May 1990, 15 arterial bypasses to the lower extremity (infrainguinal saphenous vein [n = 7] or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [n = 6], and Dacron aortofemoral bifurcation graft limbs [n = 2]) were treated for 30 occulsions with intraarterial urokinase (390,000 IU to 5,808,000 IU) infused from 3 to 40 hours. The origins of 15 graft occlusions were morphologic defects (intimal hyperplasia with anastomotic or conduit stricture), pseudoaneurysm, or progression of disease distal to the graft. Two occlusions were attributed to coagulation disorders. A cause could not be identified for 13 occlusions. Patency was initially restored to all grafts with use of thrombolytic therapy, however, adjunctive surgical thrombectomy to remove persistent thrombus from the graft or outflow vessels was required after six thrombolytic infusions. One graft in the series could not be salvaged leading to below-knee amputation. Graft defects were corrected by balloon angioplasty (n = 7) or surgical revision of the conduit (n = 8). Five significant hemorrhagic complications occurred from the catheter insertion site requiring four emergent surgical procedures and resulting in the death of a fifth patient from a myocardial infarction. This technique allows chemical thrombectomy of branch arteries distal to the graft and inaccessible to a balloon embolectomy catheter, and permits diagnosis of abnormal graft morphology that may be the cause of the graft occlusion. Graft reocclusion can be expected if technical defects in the arterial reconstruction are not revised or hypercoagulable states are not treated. \nPrimary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus: case report and review of surgical pathology. Primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus is both a rare presentation for melanoma and a cause of oesophageal neoplasm. It accounts for less than 0.1% of all primary oesophageal neoplasms. It was first recognised as a primary tumour by de la Pava et al who showed the presence of melanocytes within oesophageal mucosa. This case report includes a review of the surgical pathology. Even though it is a rare lesion it must be considered as a cause of polypoidal oesophageal lesions as both its diagnosis and treatment can present problems. It is usually fatal within one year. \nIncidence and characteristics of preventable iatrogenic cardiac arrests We studied the contribution of iatrogenic illness to cardiac arrest among patients hospitalized in 1981 in a university teaching hospital. During this 1-year period, 28 (14%) of 203 arrests in which resuscitation was attempted followed an iatrogenic complication. Seventeen (61%) of the 28 patients died. The demographic characteristics of patients with iatrogenic arrest did not differ strikingly from those of other patients who arrested. However, patients with iatrogenic arrest were less likely to be in cardiogenic shock or to have suffered an acute myocardial infarction prior to arrest. They were more likely to survive to discharge from the hospital and to be taking digoxin or antiarrhythmic medication prior to arrest. Among the 28 cases of iatrogenic cardiac arrest, 18 (9% of all arrests) might have been prevented by stricter attention to the patient's history, findings on physical examination, and laboratory data. The most common causes of potentially preventable arrest were medication errors and toxic effects (44%) as well as suboptimal response by physicians to clinical signs and symptoms (28%), most frequently dyspnea and tachypnea. Rapid, appropriate response to abnormal drug levels, to electrocardiographic signs of adverse drug effects, and to signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure or toxic effects from digoxin might decrease the incidence of cardiac arrest among hospitalized patients. \nLong-term maintenance treatment of reflux esophagitis with omeprazole. Prospective study in patients with H2-blocker-resistant esophagitis. Thirty-four patients with H2-blocker-resistant reflux esophagitis subsequently healed by 40 mg omeprazole daily entered a maintenance study with 20 mg omeprazole. In 31 evaluable cases the observation period was at least 12 months (mean 24 months). Esophagitis remained in remission in two thirds of patients despite dose reduction. Relapses of esophagitis occurred in 10 cases within six months, which rapidly healed by increasing the omeprazole dose to 40 mg. No further recurrence with 20 mg omeprazole was found later than six months. Peptic strictures primarily requiring repeated dilatation in six patients during healing with omeprazole did not reappear while on omeprazole maintenance. Major side effects that could be attributed to omeprazole were not observed. Gastrin levels remained within or slightly above the normal range in the vast majority. It is concluded that omeprazole maintenance treatment in severe reflux esophagitis is an effective and safe therapy. \nAssessment of the defunctioning efficiency of the loop ileostomy. The defunctioning efficiency of the loop ileostomy has been assessed using a radioisotope and dye technique. The median defunctioning capacity in patients without episodes of fecal discharge per rectum (n = 18) was 99.99 percent and was not affected by body position or the formation of a dependent stoma. In patients (n = 4) who passed fecal material per rectum but who had no stomal retraction, the median defunctioning efficiency was 99.99 percent, and continued fecal discharge was considered to be due to mucopurulent secretion from active distal disease. In patients who passed fecal material per rectum and also had a retracted stoma (n = 4), the defunctioning efficiency was significantly reduced (median = 84.70 [31.2-99.10 percent; P less than 0.01]), owing to the overspill into the distal limb. Two patients underwent stomal revision, with an improvement in defunctioning efficiency to 99.99 percent. \nEndocrine responses to long-term administration of the antiprogesterone RU486 in patients with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE: To examine endocrine and clinical responses to long-term administration of RU486 in patients with endometriosis. DESIGN: Prospective open trial. SETTING: Faculty practice of the authors. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Six normally cycling women with endometriosis were recruited. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received RU486 100 mg/d for 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Hormonal changes during RU486 were compared with control data obtained in the preceding cycle during the early follicular phase. Clinical responses were determined by patient assessment and second-look laparoscopy. RESULTS: All women became amenorrheic, and daily urinary levels of ovarian steroid metabolites remained acyclic. Mean luteinizing hormone (LH) (P less than 0.02) and LH pulse amplitude (P less than 0.05) were increased without changes in LH pulse frequency. An antiglucocorticoid effect was demonstrated by an increase in serum cortisol (P less than 0.01) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (P less than 0.05) levels. Treatment resulted in an improvement in pelvic pain in all subjects without significant change in the extent of disease as evaluated by follow-up laparoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Daily administration of RU486 results in acyclic ovarian function and improvement in the subjective painful symptoms of endometriosis. \nFluconazole: a new triazole antifungal agent. Fluconazole is a recently approved agent for the treatment of certain fungal infections. Based on available studies, the drug is clearly effective in oropharyngeal candidiasis in immunosuppressed hosts. Current evidence suggests it may be more efficacious than other azole drugs for oropharyngeal disease. It is probably also effective in other infections due to Candida species, but controlled studies are lacking. Fluconazole is also efficacious in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, but recent reports question its use as initial therapy in HIV-infected patients with this illness. The drug, however, is clearly more effective than amphotericin B in the suppression of cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients and is the treatment of choice in this situation. \nHypophysectomy inhibits the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha by rat macrophages: partial restoration by exogenous growth hormone or interferon gamma. We recently demonstrated that GH and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) act in a similar manner to prime macrophages in vitro and in vivo for enhanced superoxide anion release. In this report we investigated the physiological role of the pituitary gland and GH in in vivo priming of resident peritoneal macrophages for the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in vitro. Compared to normal rats, hypophysectomized animals had an 83% reduction in macrophage production of TNF alpha after in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Sham operation had no significant effect on the ability of macrophages to secrete TNF alpha in response to lipopolysaccharide. Both native pituitary-derived porcine GH (48 micrograms/rat.9 days) and native pituitary-derived rat GH (96 micrograms/rat.9 days) more than tripled the in vitro production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (342 and 358 vs. 112 U/mg protein for placebo-treated rats, respectively). Each of these preparations of GH also increased growth more than 6-fold in hypophysectomized rats (32 and 30 g vs. 5 g in placebo controls). Heat inactivation of native pituitary-derived porcine GH significantly reduced its in vivo ability to augment both TNF alpha synthesis by macrophages and body growth. Recombinant rat IFN gamma (2000 U/rat.9 days) more than tripled the production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (343 vs. 112 U/mg protein). In contrast to its in vivo effects, addition of GH in vitro to macrophages from hypophysectomized rats did not prime these cells for the synthesis of TNF alpha, indicating an indirect mechanism of action for GH. To further test the biological relevancy of GH with respect to synthesis of TNF alpha, hemorrhagic necrosis of TNF alpha-sensitive murine methyl-cholanthrene-induced tumors was assessed in pituitary-intact mice. Native porcine GH (133 micrograms/mouse.7 days) significantly augmented both the necrosis to tumor ratio and the hemorrhage to tumor ratio. These findings establish the physiological relevance of the pituitary gland and GH in the priming of macrophages for TNF alpha synthesis. \nMentally retarded individuals--a population at risk? When comparing the aging process of mentally retarded (MR) persons with the nondisabled population, researchers have established an earlier lower limit for the onset of old age for MR persons and a higher mortality rate. The reason for early senescence has not been successfully resolved, but the finding that cardiovascular disorders are the most prevalent form of disease among elderly MR persons suggests a relationship between lifestyles and higher mortality rate. Indeed, studies that evaluated the cardiovascular fitness (CVF) of MR individuals demonstrated substandard levels of fitness. The results of these studies, however, are not conclusive due to variation in test methodologies, motivational factors, and issues of test validity and reliability. Training studies which have purported to determine trainability of this population have also shown confusing results, perhaps attributed to the same protocol inconsistencies. Therefore, the purposes of this article are 1) to review previous methods of evaluating CVF of MR adults and determine whether testing methodologies invalidate the results of these studies, 2) to review training studies involving adult MR individuals and determine whether this population is capable of improving their CVF, and 3) to identify areas where further research is needed to fully describe the functional cardiovascular characteristics of MR adults. \nCase report: cisplatin-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome. Two patients developed noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE), following red blood cell transfusion in a setting of acute cisplatin nephropathy. One manifested the full picture of hemolytic uremic syndrome, the other had transient features following blood transfusion. We further reviewed the clinical records on blood transfusion for all patients with cisplatin nephropathy. A third case of (NCPE) was identified in a patient with acute renal dysfunction. However, none of the 16 patients with cisplatin-induced, mild stable chronic renal impairment had pulmonary dysfunction or other laboratory evidence for microangiopathy following transfusion. Hemolytic uremic syndrome may be a rare manifestation of cisplatin toxicity. Caution is indicated in transfusing patients with acute platinum nephropathy even in the absence of overt microangiopathy. The pathogenesis of this syndrome and the cause for NCPE is unclear. The literature is reviewed and discussed. \nVentriculoatrial shunts for hydrocephalus and cardiac valvulopathy: an echocardiographic evaluation. A group of 20 patients with ventriculoatrial shunts placed as surgical treatment for hydrocephalus were evaluated for cardiac lesions, particularly of the tricuspid valve. Patients with histories of septic or thromboembolic events were excluded. In each patient a clinical history, complete physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray film and M-mode, two-dimensional and pulsed continuous wave and color-coded Doppler echocardiography were performed. Eight patients were found to have cardiac abnormalities including tricuspid valve insufficiency, tricuspid stenosis and insufficiency, and the catheter passing through the foramen ovale into the left atrium. These findings demonstrate that tricuspid valvular lesions are frequent in patients with ventriculoatrial shunts, and that periodic echocardiographic evaluation should be performed routinely. \nExtensive pulmonary embolism presenting as severe adult respiratory distress syndrome after surgical resection of a cornual pregnancy. A rare case of severe adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with a Po2 of 9 mm Hg after surgical resection of a cornual pregnancy at 10 weeks' gestation was treated successfully with positive end-expiratory pressure. The underlying cause, extensive pulmonary embolism, was subsequently revealed. The patient survived without residual brain damage. The possible causes of adult respiratory distress syndrome in pregnancy are discussed. \nComparison of rubidium-82 positron emission tomography and thallium-201 SPECT imaging for detection of coronary artery disease. The diagnostic performance of rubidium-82 (Rb-82) positron emission tomography (PET) and thallium-201 (Tl-201) single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) for detecting coronary artery disease was investigated in 81 patients (52 men, 29 women). PET studies using 60 mCi of Rb-82 were performed at baseline and after intravenous infusion of 0.56 mg/kg dipyridamole in conjunction with handgrip stress. Tl-201 SPECT was performed after dipyridamole-handgrip stress and, in a subset of patients, after treadmill exercise. Sensitivity, specificity and overall diagnostic accuracy were assessed using both visually and quantitatively interpreted coronary angiograms. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET for detection of coronary artery disease (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) were 84, 88 and 85%, respectively. In comparison, the performance of SPECT revealed a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 53% (p less than 0.05 vs PET) and accuracy of 79%. Similar results were obtained using either visual or quantitative angiographic criteria for severity of coronary artery disease. In 43 patients without prior myocardial infarction, the sensitivity for detection of disease was 71 and 73%, respectively, similar for both PET and SPECT. There was no significant difference in diagnostic performance between imaging modalities when 2 different modes of stress (exercise treadmill vs intravenous dipyridamole plus handgrip) were used with SPECT imaging. Thus, Rb-82 PET provides improved specificity compared with Tl-201 SPECT for identifying coronary artery disease, most likely due to the higher photon energy of Rb-82 and attenuation correction provided by PET. However, post-test referral cannot be entirely excluded as a potential explanation for the lower specificity of Tl-201 SPECT. \nTreatment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea with a dental orthosis. A dental orthosis, designed to increase the size of the upper airway by advancing the mandible, was used in 68 patients to treat snoring and varying degrees of obstructive sleep apnea. The orthosis increased the posterior airway space, as assessed by lateral cephalograms. Seven months (range 2 to 25) after beginning use, 75 percent of patients were using the orthosis regularly. Snoring, by report, was improved in all patients but one (p less than 0.001) and was eliminated in 42 percent (95 percent confidence interval 30 to 55 percent). Sleep quality and sleepiness were also reported improved. Apneas and hypopneas, measured before and after use in 20 patients with obstructive sleep apnea, were reduced from an average of 47 to 20 events per hour (p less than 0.001). Oxygenation and sleep disturbance were also improved. Apnea-hypopnea frequency was reduced with treatment to less than 20/h in 13 patients. Residual frequencies greater than 20/h were associated with higher initial frequencies of apneas and hypopneas. Side effects of orthosis use were minor, and no serious complications were observed. The dental orthosis is an effective treatment for the symptom of snoring and can also effectively treat obstructive sleep apnea of moderate severity. \nProlactin reduction after combined therapy for prolactin macroadenomas. The ability of surgery or bromocriptine to produce endocrine control of a prolactin macroadenoma decreases as the prolactin level increases. Guidelines for the use of multimodality therapy have not been developed for tumors associated with markedly elevated prolactin levels. We reviewed the records of 21 patients with prolactin levels greater than 200 ng/ml treated by transsphenoidal surgery and postoperative radiotherapy with or without a dopamine agonist. Values before and after treatment were available for 19 patients (13 men and 6 women). The mean basal prolactin level before treatment for the entire group was 2410 ng/ml. Surgery and radiotherapy resulted in a 90% reduction and serum prolactin levels within normal limits in 0 of 7 patients, versus the combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and dopamine agonist, which resulted in a 99.5% reduction and values within the normal range in 12 of 12 patients. Spontaneous physiological improvement was not often observed. One woman and two men were able subsequently to have children. A plan for these patients is discussed. \nStereotactic brain biopsy in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Fifteen patients with cerebral involvement by malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were identified, among more than 200 patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. All but one of these cases were diagnosed accurately by the stereotactic biopsy procedure. In 12 of 14 patients, the material was adequate to classify the lymphoma according to the Working Formulation. Because all but one of the lesions were intermediate or high-grade neoplasms, a diagnosis of lymphoma was often possible by conventional light microscopic examination alone. Monotypic light chain expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemical techniques in six patients, and positivity for B-cell markers was observed in an additional case. In one instance, two stereotactic biopsy specimens were interpreted as being suggestive of lymphoma, but necrosis and inflammation prevented a definitive diagnosis. Nine patients had no known risk factors for cerebral lymphoma, and the diagnosis often was unsuspected clinically. \nMultivariate clinical models and quantitative dipyridamole-thallium imaging to predict cardiac morbidity and death after vascular reconstruction. Patients with peripheral vascular disease have a high prevalence of coronary artery disease and are at increased risk for cardiac morbidity and death after vascular reconstruction. The present study was undertaken to assess the value of 18 clinical parameters, of 7 clinical scoring systems, and of quantitative dipyridamole-thallium imaging for predicting the occurrence of postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Vascular surgery was performed in 125 patients. Thirteen postoperative cardiac events occurred, including 10 cardiac deaths and 3 nonfatal infarctions. Clinical parameters were not useful in predicting postoperative outcome. All 63 patients with normal scan results or fixed perfusion defects underwent surgery uneventfully, whereas 21% (13/62) of patients with reversible defects had a postoperative cardiac complication. By use of quantitative scintigraphic indexes we found that patients with reversible defects could be stratified into intermediate and high-risk subgroups with postoperative event rates of 5% (2/47) and 85% (11/13), respectively, despite intensive postoperative monitoring and antianginal medication. Thus in patients unable to complete a standard exercise stress test, postoperative outcome cannot be predicted clinically, whereas dipyridamole-thallium imaging successfully identified all patients who had a postoperative cardiac event. By use of quantification we found that patients with reversible defects can be stratified into an intermediate risk subgroup that can undergo surgery with minimal complication rate and a high-risk subgroup that requires coronary angiography. \nA randomized, controlled trial of treatment of alcoholic hepatitis with parenteral nutrition and oxandrolone. II. Short-term effects on nitrogen metabolism, metabolic balance, and nutrition. Patients with moderately severe or severe alcoholic hepatitis, described in a companion paper in this issue, had serial studies of energy and protein metabolism and elemental balances before and during treatment for 21 days with one of four randomly assigned regimens: 1) standard therapy, consisting of abstinence, a balanced, nutritionally adequate diet, and multivitamins; 2) oxandrolone (20 mg orally four times a day) plus standard therapy; 3) nutritional supplementation, consisting of 2 liters of 3.5% crystalline amino acids in 5% dextrose given by peripheral vein (PPN) plus standard therapy; and 4) a combination of the other three treatments. Dietary and intravenous intakes and weights were recorded daily, and weekly averages were calculated. Anthropometric measurements and blood studies were done weekly; blood studies included white blood cell counts and differentials, serum prealbumin, transferrin, and total protein and plasma aminograms. Four-days complete balance studies and measures of 15N,1-13C-leucine metabolism also were performed at baseline and after the treatment period. Major findings were as follows: a) Intakes of total calories and protein were significantly higher in PPN-treated than in other groups. b) All patients had positive elemental balances, both at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. However, those treated with PPN (with or without oxandrolone) had higher positive balances of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium, indicating improvement in lean body mass. c) Anthropometric measurements showed no significant changes, but measures of the visceral protein compartment (serum prealbumin, transferrin, total protein, total lymphocyte count) improved significantly with time. For most of these variables, increases were significantly greater in those treated with PPN with or without oxandrolone than in the other groups. However, for prealbumin, the increase was greatest in the oxandrolone-treated group d) PPN treatment produced dramatic increases in levels of branched-chain amino acids and improvement in the ratio of plasma branched chain to aromatic amino acids. Other treatments had no effect on plasma aminograms. e) Metabolism of 15N,1-13C-leucine was normal and was not affected significantly by treatment. Therapy with PPN and/or oxandrolone was tolerated well. We conclude that PPN has favorable effects on energy and protein metabolism in florid alcoholic hepatitis; oxandrolone has lesser effects, although it may exert some additional action and particularly increases serum prealbumin levels. The results support the use of nutritional supplementation in therapy of moderately severe or severe alcoholic hepatitis. \nReversal of a dense, persistent, holohemispheric neurological deficit after an endarterectomy of the carotid artery: case report. The role and timing of a carotid endarterectomy in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke-in-evolution remain controversial. Although computed tomographic (CT) scans typically show no abnormalities in the acute stage, it is generally agreed that a dense neurological deficit (hemiplegia) and/or multiple modality neurological disturbance (involving motor, sensory, gaze, and visual field impairment) represent contraindications to surgical intervention. We present a case of an acute right holohemispheric neurological deficit including dense hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, gaze disturbance, hemineglect, and impaired level of consciousness. This persisted for 4 days while serial CT scans showed no evidence of infarction. Angiography revealed pre-occlusive stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with sluggish antegrade flow. The anterior collaterals of the circle of Willis were impaired, and the right middle cerebral artery territory filled via the posterior communicating artery. Despite the dense neurological deficit persisting for 4 days, a carotid endarterectomy was performed. Gradual neurological improvement was noted within hours of the operation, and all neurological deficits resolved within the subsequent 3 days. This case is consistent with prolonged holohemispheric hemodynamic compromise below the threshold of neurological dysfunction, but above the threshold of tissue infarction (\"idling neurons\"). Features assisting in the recognition of this unusual scenario and the indications and risks of revascularization in this setting are discussed. \nWilliam Heberden and Myron Prinzmetal: angina pectoris. The most significant accounts of angina pectoris appeared in the medical literature separated by nearly two centuries. They were Heberden's initial description of classic angina and Prinzmetal's report of the variant form. Angina pectoris represents a transient myocardial oxygen deficiency. It is usually related to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, but there are a number of less common etiologies, most notably aortic stenosis. Stable and unstable forms exist, with stable angina being further subclassified as being of one of four patterns: classic, variant, atypical, and angina equivalent. \nThe Purkinje cell and its afferents in human hereditary ataxia. The cerebellar cortex in patients with autosomal dominant and recessive ataxia was studied by Golgi impregnation and immunocytochemistry in order to gain further insight into the pathogenesis of neuronal atrophy which accompanies these disorders. Monoclonal antisera were used to visualize phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated neurofilament proteins, and a synapse-specific protein (P38; synaptophysin). Golgi stain and immunocytochemistry for non-phosphorylated neurofilament protein revealed partial or complete loss of distal Purkinje cell dendrities in the dominant cases and in one recessive case. Many preserved parallel fibres were shown by the monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated neurofilament protein. This antibody also gave strong reaction product in torpedoes. Axosomatic and axodendritic terminals on Purkinje cells were reduced in number, and loss of mossy fiber terminals was revealed by monoclonal anti-P38. The described methods provided additional morphological evidence of the heterogeneity of the hereditary ataxias. Purkinje cell atrophy progressed from loss and simplification of the dendritic tree to disappearance of the cell body. While these cells appeared to be especially vulnerable, other neurons of the molecular and granular layers were not exempt. There was evidence that at least some extracerebellar afferents, such as mossy fibers, were also affected by the disease process. \nSalvage therapy with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support in the treatment of primary nonseminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors. The authors reported their experience with the use of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow rescue (ABMR) as salvage therapy in the treatment of patients with recurrent and refractory primary nonseminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors (PMGCT). Since 1987, the authors have treated 12 patients with PMGCT with high-dose carboplatin (1500 mg/m2 to 1800 mg/m2) and etoposide (1200 mg/m2 to 1350 mg/m2) (in two patients ifosfamide [10 g/m2] was added) with ABMR. Patients were either in second relapse or cisplatin refractory (progression within 4 weeks of last cisplatin dosing). They had received a median of two prior chemotherapy regimens (range, one to three), all had had prior cisplatin therapy, and most had failed ifosfamide-based therapy. Six patients were cisplatin refractory and of these only one achieved a partial response (PR) that was of short duration. It was planned that all patients would undergo two rounds of therapy; however, only 5 of 12 patients received two courses. The remainder had only one round of therapy either because of inadequate response (three patients) or excessive toxicity (four patients). There were four patients who died in the peritransplant period due to sepsis (two patients) or bleeding (two patients). The median survival of the group was 107 days (range, 14 days to 347 days). No patient achieved a complete remission, but there were six partial remissions, four with stable disease, and two with progressive disease. The use of high-dose carboplatin and etoposide with or without ifosfamide and ABMR was not effective in the treatment of this group of patients with PMGCT who were in second relapse or cisplatin refractory. \nPredictors of physical functioning after a cardiac event. An increased understanding of the factors that promote or hinder patients' return to optimal activity levels after a cardiac event is necessary to help them achieve this goal. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine psychologic resources, depression, physical recovery, and illness severity for their relationships with subjective and objective physical functioning (exercise data). A correlational survey design was used to assess patients' (n = 46) illness responses 9 weeks after the cardiac event. Patients also participated in a symptom-limited exercise test. The findings suggested that the individual's return to greater activity levels after a cardiac illness was associated with less depression and illness severity, and higher levels of objective physical functioning, physical recovery, and self-esteem. Further, patients' objective physical functioning was associated not only with greater subjective physical functioning but also with greater levels of physical recovery and mastery. \nElectronic fetal heart monitoring, auscultation, and neonatal outcome. In a large randomized, controlled study of fetal heart rate monitoring with either continuous electronic fetal heart monitoring or auscultation at specified intervals, only one pattern of deviation in the fetal heart rate correlated significantly with neonatal neurologic examinations at 0 to 48 hours and 72 hours to 1 week: late decelerations in stage 1 and in stage 2. Other variables from labor and delivery, specifically, duration of labor after hospital admission, failure of labor to progress, number of fetal scalp pH values, and presence of meconium were important predictors of neonatal outcome in the regression analyses. The fetal heart rate deviations did contribute significantly to the percent variance accounted for in the regression analyses with neonatal outcomes of Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes and serial neonatal neurologic examinations. \nHydrocortisone inhibits rat basophilic leukemia cell mediator release induced by neutrophil-derived histamine releasing activity as well as by anti-IgE. We determined the ability of hydrocortisone to inhibit rat basophilic leukemia cell mediator release induced by anti-IgE and by neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity (HRA-N). Serotonin release induced by HRA-N and anti-IgE was inhibited by 78 +/- 5 and 70 +/- 4%, respectively (IC50 7.5 x 10(-7)M) by hydrocortisone (10(-5)M). HRA-N does not cause arachidonic acid metabolism, however, anti-IgE induced the generation of PGD2 and leukotriene (LT)C4, and the generation of both mediators was inhibited by 10(-5)M hydrocortisone (IC50 = 4.8 x 10(-7)M, and 3.6 x 10(-9)M, respectively). Inhibition required at least 5 to 6 h of hydrocortisone exposure and was maximal after 22 h. The observed effects of hydrocortisone could be reproduced by human recombinant lipocortin-I (5 x 10(-7)M). Hydrocortisone, 10(-5)M, was a less potent inhibitor of calcium ionophore A23187-mediated serotonin release and PGD2 and LTC4 generation (inhibition of 20 +/- 2, 17 +/- 10, and 37 +/- 10%, respectively). Inasmuch as A23187-induced stimulation is not dependent on receptor coupling, the enhanced ability of hydrocortisone to inhibit IgE- and HRA-N-mediated events as compared with A23187 suggests that one possible site of action of hydrocortisone may be interruption of receptor-effector signals. In the presence of arachidonic acid, hydrocortisone-treated cells released as much LTB4 and PGD2 as control cells, however, serotonin release and LTC4 generation were inhibited 50 and 55%, respectively. Thus, these data suggest that hydrocortisone has three possible sites of action: 1) inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity, 2) inhibition of glutathione-s-transferase, and 3) inhibition of serotonin release by a third mechanism, possibly by interrupting the coupling of receptor and effector systems. \nGeographic variations in the histologic characteristics of the gastric mucosa. Histologic sections of 205 gastrectomy specimens, which were obtained for benign and malignant diseases, were reviewed. All patients were Mexican nationals. The following histologic features were recorded: intestinal metaplasia, intramucosal cysts, ciliated gastric cells, and different types of pyloric cells (\"ordinary\"; with granular cytoplasm; with small cytoplasmic vacuoles; with large cytoplasmic vacuoles; or with homogeneous \"glassy\" cytoplasm). The percentage of specimens showing intestinal metaplasia was similar in those containing gastric ulcers (42.7%) or adenocarcinomas (50.0%). Intestinal metaplasia was decreased in men 59 years of age or older and in women 69 years of age or older. Diffuse-type adenocarcinoma accounted for 90% of the gastric tumors. Only 3 of the 205 specimens (1.9%) contained intramucosal cysts, and only 1 (0.4%) showed ciliated cells. Pyloric cells with granular cytoplasm were observed in 21.2% of the specimens, and pyloric cells with small cytoplasmic vacuoles were seen in 1.9%. Pyloric cells with large vacuoles or \"glassy\" cytoplasm were not found in any case. These results indicate differences in the proportions of several histopathologic findings in the gastric mucosa, between Mexicans and other ethnic groups that have been investigated in previous surveys. The authors' findings support the hypothesis that different environmental factors, acting in disparate geographic regions, may account for dissimilarities in the histologic appearance of \"normal gastric mucosa.\". \nT-lymphocyte dysfunctions occurring together with apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies. Gut epithelial cell autoantibodies have been considered a hallmark of autoimmune enteropathy, a disorder occurring in children with protracted diarrhea of unknown etiology. Four patients (two male and two female) with such autoantibodies were studied. Immunofluorescence analysis showed two different disjunctive staining patterns: complement-fixing apical (three of four) and cytoplasmic (the remaining fourth one), which are shown to be directed against different structures. All three patients positive for complement-fixing apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies had abnormal T-cell responses in vitro, one of them with an immunoglobulin G2 immunoglobulin deficiency and another with an immunoglobulin A deficiency. An immunoglobulin A deficiency without T-cell alterations was also diagnosed in the cytoplasmic gut epithelial cell autoantibody-positive patient. These findings suggest that different immunologic alterations (either a T-cell abnormality or immunoglobulin deficiency) may favor the appearance of gut epithelial cell autoantibodies (complement-fixing apical or cytoplasmic, respectively). Furthermore, these autoantibodies should not be considered a specific marker of autoimmune enteropathy, because they may not always be associated with such a disease: two patients with apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies showed no signs of intestinal lesion or diarrhea. \nAge-related complications and optimal choice of artificial heart valves in elderly patients. The use of bioprosthetic heart valves in elderly patients is presently advocated by many since implanting mechanical valves are considered to result in unacceptable rates of thromboembolism and bleeding. However the somewhat limited durability of bioprostheses has to be acknowledged since a group of elderly patients will eventually require a reoperation due to tissue failure. We have evaluated our policy to implant mechanical heart valve prostheses even in elderly patients based on the conception that we believe that anticoagulation in this group of patients can be handled with a low rate of complications. \nMassive incisional hernia: abdominal wall replacement with Marlex mesh. Marlex (polypropylene) mesh was used to replace the abdominal wall in massive incisional herniation in 50 patients. Seventeen unsuccessful attempts at primary repair had previously been made on nine patients. Patient follow-up ranged from 6 to 120 months (mean = 45 months). There was minor hernia recurrence in four (8 per cent) patients. In each instance it was due to partial detachment of the peripheral fixation of the patch. Complications were: wound infection, four (8 per cent); wound seroma, two (4 per cent); wound haematoma, one (2 per cent); and wound sinus, six (12 per cent). Complications did not necessitate removal of the patch in any case. Inadequate peripheral attachment of the patch has been the only cause of hernia recurrence and should be avoidable. \nClinical characteristics of transient ischemic attacks in black patients. We analyzed the clinical, CT, and angiographic findings in 50 black patients with carotid transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Thirty-two percent had TIAs lasting less than 1 hour, 26% had TIAs lasting 1 to 6 hours, and 42% had TIAs lasting 6 to 24 hours. Fifty-two percent of TIA patients had CT evidence of cerebral infarction despite complete clinical recovery. CT was abnormal in two of 16 (13%) patients with TIAs lasting less than 1 hour; however, CT was abnormal in 24 of 34 (70%) patients with TIAs lasting longer than 1 hour. Angiographic findings of extracranial carotid disease appropriate to TIA symptoms were present in 12 (24%) patients. Two patients in whom the TIA episode lasted less than 1 hour later had clinical cerebral infarction, whereas 20 patients with longer-duration TIAs developed ischemic stroke within 4 months. Of these black TIA patients, 22 (44%) developed clinical cerebral infarction. \nBilateral spontaneous perilymph fistulae: a diagnostic and management dilemma. In this article, we present a case of bilateral perilymph fistulae. This entity is rare and always presents a diagnostic problem. Bilateral perilymph fistulae are more common in children and should be suspected when bilateral ear symptoms and congenital temporal bone radiographic anomalies are present. Previous trauma or barotrauma may be absent. When a patient manifests bilateral ear symptoms and a fistula has been identified and repaired in one ear, a second fistula should be suspected in the contralateral ear, especially if the fistula test is positive. \nInfluence of dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and cardiac transplantation on the relation between plasma atrial natriuretic factor and atrial pressures. To determine whether dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis or cardiac transplantation affect the relation between plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and cardiac filling pressures, right atrial plasma ANF concentration, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and right atrial pressure were measured in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 48), dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to myocarditis (n = 20) and prior cardiac transplantation (n = 34). ANF level significantly correlated with both pulmonary arterial wedge and right atrial pressures in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy; however, the presence or absence of myocarditis did not significantly alter these relations (p = 0.88 and p = 0.33 for interaction terms, respectively). For the combined group the ANF-pulmonary arterial wedge pressure relation had a slope of 8.1 pg/ml/mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI), 5.4 to 10.8; p = 0.0001) and the ANF-right atrial pressure relation a slope of 13.6 pg/ml/mm Hg (CI, 8.5 to 18.7; p = 0.0001). Receiver operator curve analysis identified an optimal dividing point of ANF 150 pg/ml with 100% (CI, 72 to 100%) of patients with right atrial pressure greater than or equal to 8 mm Hg having ANF greater than or equal to 150 pg/ml, but only 56% (CI, 42 to 69%) with pressure less than 8 mm Hg having ANF less than 150 pg/ml. Unlike the patients with cardiomyopathy (with or without myocarditis), cardiac transplant recipients displayed no correlation between ANF level and either pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (p = 0.50) or right atrial pressure (p = 0.29) despite similarly elevated ANF concentrations (mean +/- standard deviation 168 (83) pg/ml in transplant patients versus 185 (114) pg/ml in cardiomyopathy patients). It is concluded that left and right intracardiac pressures are important determinants of circulating ANF level unaffected by inflammation in patients with cardiomyopathy. \nCyst of the ligamentum flavum: report of six cases. Six cases of cyst of the ligamentum flavum with compression of a lumbar nerve root are reported. All patients exhibited recurrent back pain and sciatica. Investigation included computed tomography, myelography, or both. The correct diagnosis was reached before operation in only half the patients. High-resolution computed tomography performed in the four last patients outlined the cystic lesion with its low-density center. Surgical excision was performed in all patients. Microscopic examination showed a dense fibrous cyst arising from the ligamentum flavum. The lumen contained myxoid or necrotic material, but no epithelial lining. Cysts of the ligamentum flavum must be considered in the differential diagnosis of causes of sciatica. A firm radiological diagnosis may, at present, still require myelography combined with high-resolution computed tomography. Differentiation from synovial or ganglion cysts of the spine is discussed. \nHistopathology of incipient fundus flavimaculatus. A 9-year-old boy was diagnosed with fundus flavimaculatus in his left eye. The boy's fellow eye was enucleated at 16 months of age for retinoblastoma. The authors reviewed the material submitted for histopathologic examination and found that the retinal pigment epithelial cells demonstrated increased autofluorescence and increased reactivity to periodic acid-Schiff staining. Many cells had their melanin granules displaced toward the cell apex. The retinal pigment epithelial changes are consistent with previous histopathologic findings in fundus flavimaculatus and imply that the structural changes are seen in early life. \nHead-injured patients who talk and deteriorate into coma. Analysis of 211 cases studied with computerized tomography. Of 838 patients with severe head injuries admitted since the introduction of computerized tomography, 211 (25.1%) talked at some time between trauma and subsequent deterioration into coma. Of these 211 patients, 89 (42.2%) had brain contusion/hematoma, 46 (21.8%) an epidural hematoma, 35 (16.6%) a subdural hematoma, and 41 (19.4%) did not show focal mass lesions. Thus, four of every five patients who deteriorated into coma after suffering an apparently nonsevere head injury had a mass lesion potentially requiring surgery: the mass was intracerebral in 52.3% of the cases and extracerebral in 47.6%. Patients aged 20 years or less had a 39% chance of having a nonfocal mass lesion (diffuse brain damage), a 29% chance of having an epidural hematoma, and a 32% chance of having an intradural mass lesion; patients over 40 years had only a 3% chance of having a nonfocal mass lesion, an 18% chance of having an epidural hematoma, and a 79% chance of having a intradural mass lesion. Sixty-eight (32.2%) patients died and 143 (67.8%) survived. The following were independent outcome predictors (in order of significance): Glasgow Coma Scale score following deterioration into coma, the highest intracranial pressure during the patient's course, the degree of midline shift, the type of intracranial lesion, and the age of the patient. In contrast, the mechanism of injury, the verbal Glasgow Coma Scale score during the lucid interval, and the length of time until deterioration or until operative intervention did not influence the final result. \nTransformation-dependent activation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator by a plasmin-independent mechanism: involvement of cell surface membranes. Transformed cells produce elevated levels of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), which has been linked with the invasive or migratory phenotype of these cells. The u-PA is secreted and normally maintained in the inactive, single-chain form (scu-PA) and it has been assumed that natural activation occurs via a plasmin-mediated cleavage converting scu-PA to the active, two-chain form (tcu-PA). We now demonstrate that secreted scu-PA in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblast (RSVCEF) cultures is activated by an endogenous, plasmin-independent mechanism. Normal CEFs and CEFs infected with a temperature-sensitive RSV mutant and incubated at the nonpermissive temperature do not activate scu-PA. Conditioned medium harvested from plasmin-free cultures of RSVCEFs contains active tcu-PA as determined by two independent methods. The scu-PA is progressively converted with time in culture and requires the presence of intact cells or a plasma membrane-enriched fraction. When added to RSVCEF cultures, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 20-41 of the growth factor domain of chicken u-PA blocks the conversion to tcu-PA, and scu-PA accumulates in the cultures. These results suggest that scu-PA is secreted by cells, becomes bound to a u-PA receptor, and is proteolytically converted to active tcu-PA by a catalytic mechanism on the surface of RSV-transformed fibroblasts. \nEarly prevention of left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition [published erratum appears in Lancet 1991 May 11;337(8750):1174] Left ventricular dysfunction can be improved with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition started 1 week after myocardial infarction or later. To see whether earlier intervention may confer greater benefit, a double-blind study was carried out in which 100 patients with Q wave myocardial infarction, but without clinical heart failure, were randomly allocated treatment with captopril 50 mg twice daily or placebo starting 24-48 h after onset of symptoms. Left ventricular volumes were measured regularly during 3 months of treatment and after a 48 h withdrawal period by means of two-dimensional echocardiography. The placebo group showed significant increases in left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDVI) and end-systolic (LVESVI) volume indices, with the ejection fraction unchanged. By contrast, the captopril group showed a slight but not significant rise in LVEDVI and a significant reduction in LVESVI with ejection fraction increased significantly. At 3 months there was a 4.6% difference in the change in ejection fraction from baseline between the groups (p less than 0.0001). Most of the treatment benefit was evident at 1 month and there were no changes in left ventricular volumes after 48 h withdrawal of treatment at 3 months. Heart failure requiring treatment with frusemide developed in 7 patients in each group during the study period; 3 of these (1 captopril-treated, 2 placebo-treated) had to be withdrawn from the trial with severe heart failure requiring open treatment. Thus early treatment with captopril is effective in preventing the ventricular dilatation that can occur after Q wave myocardial infarction. \nLoss of heterozygosity on the short arm of chromosome 17 is associated with high proliferative capacity and DNA aneuploidy in primary human breast cancer. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p) was found in 27 of 52 (52%) previously untreated primary breast cancers. There was a significant correlation between this 17p allelic loss and two parameters associated with aggressive tumor behavior: high cellular proliferative fraction and DNA aneuploidy. These correlations with high cellular proliferative fraction and DNA aneuploidy were not found in tumors with LOH at nine other chromosome locations. The p53 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene located at 17p13, was examined for aberrations to determine whether it is the target for the 17p LOH in breast cancer. Unlike other types of human cancer, there were no homozygous deletions or rearrangements of the p53 gene, and only 2 of 13 (15%) were mutated in the conserved region where mutational \"hot spots\" have been previously located. Therefore, we hypothesize that, in breast cancer, either loss or inactivation of gene(s) on chromosome 17p other than the p53 gene or a different mechanism of p53 gene inactivation may be responsible for the observed high labeling index and DNA aneuploidy associated with LOH at 17p. \nTransurethral resection of prostate prior to definitive irradiation for prostate cancer. Lack of correlation with treatment outcome. From 1970 through 1983, 107 patients with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the prostate were treated with radiotherapy with curative intent at Duke University Medical Center. Forty-five patients (42%) underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes prior to beginning radiotherapy. Sixty-one patients (57%) were diagnosed by needle biopsy. TURP and needle biopsy groups were comparable (age, elevated acid phosphatase, early [A2, B] and late [C, D1] disease stages, and follow-up). TURP patients were more likely to have poorly differentiated tumors and were more often given concurrent hormonal therapy. Both univariate and multivariate analyses to study the effect of TURP on patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy were done. We were unable to demonstrate any adverse impact of TURP on the outcome of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. This issue remains controversial and should be addressed in a prospective, randomized trial. \nCerebral potentials evoked by painful, laser stimuli in patients with syringomyelia. Brief cutaneous heat stimuli generated by a CO2 laser were used to elicit late somatosensory evoked cerebral potentials (SEPc) in 10 patients with syringomyelia. For comparison, early and late cerebral potentials in response to electrical nerve stimuli (SEPn) were recorded in the same session. In 8 patients with localized impairment of pain and temperature sensitivity we found complete absence of SEPc after stimulation of the affected area; in another patient with similar sensory deficits, the SEPc was grossly attenuated and delayed. In 1 patient with intact pain sensitivity but absent temperature sensitivity, a well defined SEPc could be recorded. Both early cortical SEPn and late SEPn in response to conventional nerve stimuli were normal in all patients and thus did not differentiate control and affected areas. These data indicate that alteration of SEPc correlates with altered pain sensitivity in patients with a circumscribed spinal lesion. SEPc may thus be used as a neurophysiological test in the assessment of hypalgesic dermatomes. \nThe role of the transcerebellar view in the detection of fetal central nervous system anomaly. The current resolution of antenatal ultrasonography permits the sonologist to visualize and critically evaluate the cerebellum and cisterna magna. Abnormalities in the size and shape of these structures will assist the sonologist in the detection of the majority of central nervous system malformations. \nInvasive aspergillosis of the maxilla in an immunocompromised patient. Patients who are immunocompromised have a high susceptibility to infection, which can be fatal. Studies have shown that patients receiving chemotherapeutic and adjunctive medications have inhibited inflammatory response to microbes, particularly those increasing the potential for the development of invasive infection. Aspergillus is a fungus often found in the atmosphere. Colonization of Aspergillus in the upper respiratory tract is common. In the immunocompromised patient, Aspergillus flavus is found to be the most frequent fungus cultured in the maxillary sinus. Because of the depressed immunologic state of the patient, A. flavus can differentiate into hyphal forms producing toxins that destroy epithelial tissues. Penetration of Aspergillus into connective and vascular tissue produces thrombosis and ultimately necrosis of hard and soft tissue. \nTotal parenteral nutrition and tumor metastasis. A major clinical concern with providing total parenteral nutrition to the tumor-bearing host is the potential to stimulate tumor growth. This study was performed to determine the effect of total parenteral nutrition on primary tumor growth and spontaneous pulmonary metastasis in Lobund rats with subcutaneous prostate adenocarcinoma (PA-III) implants. Significant acceleration of primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis occurred in animals receiving parenteral nutrition consisting of amino acids, dextrose, and lipid or standard enteral nutrition compared to control animals. This study represents the first report of stimulating tumor metastasis with specific parenteral nutrients and clearly indicates that both primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis can be altered by exogenous substrate administration. \nPeptic ulcer pathophysiology. Despite extensive research, the etiology of peptic ulcer disease remains unclear. Given the multiple processes that control acid and pepsin secretion and defense and repair of the gastroduodenal mucosa, it is likely that the cause of ulceration differs between individuals. Acid and pepsin appear to be necessary but not sufficient ingredients in the ulcerative process. It is clear that the majority of gastric ulcers and a substantial number of duodenal ulcers do not have increased gastric acid secretion. Recent research has focused more on protection and repair of the stomach and duodenum. NSAIDs cause a significant number of gastric and duodenal ulcers; this is probably due to inhibition of prostaglandin production with loss of its protective effects. In the absence of NSAIDs and gastrinoma, it appears that most gastric ulcers and all duodenal ulcers occur in the setting of H. pylori infection. Evidence is mounting in support of H. pylori as a necessary ingredient in the ulcerative process, similar to acid and pepsin. It is not known whether the bacteria or the accompanying inflammation is the more important factor in the pathophysiology. Although the pathophysiology of gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer is similar, there are clearly differences between the two groups. Duodenal ulcer is typified by H. pylori infection and duodenitis and in many cases impaired duodenal bicarbonate secretion in the face of moderate increases in acid and peptic activity. These facts suggest the following process: increased peptic activity coupled with decreased duodenal buffering capacity may lead to increased mucosal injury and result in gastric metaplasia. In the presence of antral H. pylori, the gastric metaplasia can become colonized and inflamed. The inflammation or the infection itself then disrupts the process of mucosal defense or regeneration resulting in ulceration. A cycle of further injury and increased inflammation with loss of the framework for regeneration may then cause a chronic ulcer. Gastric ulcer often occurs with decreased acid-peptic activity, suggesting that mucosal defensive impairments are more important. The combination of inflammation, protective deficiencies, and moderate amounts of acid and pepsin may be enough to induce ulceration. Many questions remain in understanding the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease. The physiology and pathophysiology of mucosal regeneration and the mechanisms by which H. pylori and inflammation disrupt normal gastroduodenal function will be fruitful areas of future investigation. \nProstaglandin-stimulated recovery of the human duodenal epithelium: effects of misoprostol on ethanol damage. This study was designed to determine whether prostaglandins can stimulate the repair of human duodenal epithelium. Ten healthy volunteers were given 50 ml 40% ethanol through an endoscope onto the duodenal mucosa 1-7 cm from the pyloric sphincter; 3 min later, misoprostol (200 micrograms) or inert vehicle (5 ml) was given locally in the same way. One and 5 h later, endoscopy was repeated to evaluate the damage. The conditions of the mucosa were evaluated by endoscopy and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy in biopsies taken at time 0 and 3 min, 1 and 5 h after ethanol. The study was double-blind with a cross-over balanced design. Three minutes after ethanol administration, the duodenal mucosa showed hyperemia with hemorrhagic lesions. Under the electron microscope, the lesions were caused by vascular engorgement or red blood cell extravasation into the submucosa; the epithelium underlining lesions showed loss of superficial cells and damage to the upper layer of the mucosa. One hour after ethanol, there was a striking difference between the two treatment groups, with a substantial recovery of the duodenal epithelium in the misoprostol-treated volunteers. Although spontaneous recovery was evident in the control group, there was also a significant difference at 5 h. Our results suggest that prostaglandins are able to stimulate the recovery of the duodenal epithelium after acute damage. \nRelation between p53 overexpression and established prognostic factors in breast cancer. The nuclear phosphoprotein p53 is expressed in all normal cells and appears to function in cell cycle regulation. Abnormally high levels of the protein are found in many different types of cancer. In breast carcinoma overexpression of p53 is associated with point mutations within highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. These altered genes encode stable p53 proteins that can be detected by standard immunohistochemical techniques unable to detect rapidly degraded wild-type protein. The level of p53 expression in 184 primary breast cancer specimens was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis and related to the following established prognostic factors for breast cancer: age, stage, metastatic involvement, concentration of estrogen and progesterone receptors, proliferative index, and HER-2/neu overexpression. Fifty (27%) of these primary breast cancer specimens had widespread overexpression of p53. Highly significant associations were found between p53 overexpression and late stage, metastatic spread, and low concentration of progesterone receptors. The presence of elevated levels of mutant p53 may itself be a prognostic factor in human breast cancer and activation of this oncogene may be important in the ability of a tumor to metastasize. \nAngiographic management of retroperitoneal hemorrhage from renal angiomyolipoma in polycystic kidney disease. Angiographic management of bilateral angiomyolipomas complicated by hemorrhage in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is presented. The patient had mild stigmata of tuberous sclerosis, and a family history of tuberous sclerosis and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The radiographic features at diagnosis, and those present during and after embolization are described. Radiological criteria for diagnosis and successful control of bleeding with intra-arterial selective embolization are discussed. Radiographic features before, during and after embolization are exhibited. \nCombined interferon alfa and doxorubicin in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer. Interferon alfa and doxorubicin have been shown to have synergistic effects when tested in vitro with cells derived from cervical cancers. A clinical trial was designed, testing interferon alfa plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancers. Twenty-one patients were given interferon alfa, 10 million units per square meter intramuscularly and 10 million units per square meter intravenously over a 30-minute infusion period. One hour later 20 mg/m2 doxorubicin was given intravenously slowly over a 2-hour period. Treatments were repeated once weekly for 3 weeks. Initial response evaluation was done at week 5, and treatment was continued on an every-other-week schedule for patients showing favorable responses or stable disease. Bone marrow, hepatic, and renal toxicities were minimal. Fever and malaise were the major sources of toxicity. Of the 17 evaluable patients, six had clinical partial responses. Two of the responders have enjoyed more than 5 years' survival. This regimen is well tolerated and does have efficacy in some patients with advanced cervical cancers. \nProteus syndrome. Ultrastructural study of linear verrucous and depigmented nevi. Proteus syndrome is a rare hamartomatous disorder characterized by multifocal overgrowths that can involve any structure of the body. Clinical manifestations include macrodactyly, hemihypertrophy, subcutaneous masses, exostosis, cerebroid thickening of palms and soles, and linear skin lesions. About 50 cases have been described, but the ultrastructural features of the linear skin lesions have not been characterized. We describe the clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural findings for a 30-year-old patient who had a mild form of Proteus syndrome with linear lesions characterized by a mixed pattern of hyperkeratosis and depigmentation. Light microscopy of the linear nevus showed acanthosis and hyperorthokeratosis. Electron microscopy revealed extensive vacuolation at the interface between melanocytes and keratinocytes, with large aggregations of densely packed granules in the intercellular space. Melanocytes showed only slight degenerative changes. An immunohistochemical study of the expression of epidermal growth factor receptors revealed no significant abnormalities. \nCauses of death in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Of the 355 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) examined at the Mayo Clinic, 49 had died (9 of causes other than TSC). We attempted to determine what pattern of organ involvement occurred most often in the 40 patients who died of TSC. One baby died of cardiac failure due to cardiac rhabdomyomas, and one child died of rupture of an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Eleven patients died of renal disease, which was the commonest cause of death. Ten patients died as a result of brain tumors, and four patients (who were 40 years of age or older) died of lymphangiomyomatosis of the lung. Thirteen patients with severe mental handicaps died of either status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia; in all but one of these patients, the only source of information was the death certificate. Survival curves show a decreased survival for patients with TSC in comparison with that for the general population. Patients with TSC need lifelong follow-up for early detection of potentially life-threatening complications. \nDescriptive epidemiologic study of epilepsy syndromes in a district of northwest Tuscany, Italy. To evaluate the prevalence of epilepsy syndromes in a district in Northwest Tuscany (Vecchiano, 9,952 inhabitants) we identified all suspected cases (probable epilepsy) from several information sources: files of local doctors, prescriptions of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), hospital files from the center for epilepsy at the University of Pisa, medical files from university and hospital departments in Pisa, and files of the school doctors and social workers in the district of Vecchiano. All persons suspected of having epilepsy were examined; 51 cases of epilepsy were found, i.e., a prevalence rate of 5.1 in 1,000. During a previous study performed in the same district with the \"house-to-house\" method, a lower rate was found. Our study confirms that use of different epidemiologic investigational methods can produce different results. \nFuture directions of laser phototherapy for diagnosis and treatment of malignancies: fantasy, fallacy, or reality? A new and highly promising adjunctive modality for the diagnosis and therapy of malignancies is under development using lasers and tumor targeting dyes. To reach the eventual goal of clinical treatment, s",
