        "text": "f Hodgkin's disease (HD) is rarely described, with only 42 cases in the literature. Since the outbreak of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, there has been an increasing number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (HIV+) persons who have diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and, more recently, atypical aggressive HD. The authors report the case of a patient with a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) and Stage IVB HD who, after a drug-induced clinical remission, had intracerebral mixed-cellularity HD. This appears to be the first report of intracerebral HD in a person who is HIV+. \nLack of induction of suppressor T cells by intestinal epithelial cells from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The mechanisms underlying the chronic unrelenting inflammatory response seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are poorly understood. We have recently proposed a novel role for the normal intestinal enterocyte, that of antigen presenting cell. However, in contrast to conventional antigen presenting cells, normal enterocytes appear to selectively activate CD8+ antigen nonspecific suppressor T cells. To determine whether failure of this process may be occurring in inflammatory bowel disease, freshly isolated enterocytes from small and large bowel from normal patients, patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and inflammatory (diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, and gold induced colitis) controls were co-cultured with allogeneic T cells in a modified mixed lymphocyte reaction. In contrast to normal enterocytes, 42/42 Crohn's and 35/38 ulcerative colitis-derived epithelial cells stimulated CD4+ T cells, whereas 65/66 and 9/9 normal and inflammatory control enterocytes, respectively, stimulated CD8+ T cells (as previously described), suggesting that the results seen were not just a reflection of underlying inflammation. Furthermore, IBD enterocytes from both histologically involved and uninvolved tissue were similar in their ability to selectively activate CD4+ T cells, speaking for a more global defect in epithelial cells in IBD. Finally, activated T cells from IBD epithelial cell-stimulated mixed lymphocyte cultures displayed potent T helper activity in an antigen nonspecific fashion. Taken together, these data suggest that there may be an intrinsic defect in epithelial cells from patients with IBD, resulting in the inability to normally stimulate suppressor T cells in an antigen overloaded environment. \nLeukoaraiosis and ventricular enlargement in patients with ischemic stroke. We studied the relationship between ventricular size and nonspecific periventricular lucency on computed tomograms (leukoaraiosis) in 192 patients with ischemic stroke. Leukoaraiosis did not occur in 21 patients less than 50 years of age; ventricular size could not be measured in an additional 29. Leukoaraiosis was graded from 0 to 4 on a semiquantitative scale; bicaudate, frontal horn, and posterior horn indices were used as measures of ventricular size. Patients with leukoaraiosis were older (difference between means 7 years, t = 5.3, df = 140, p less than 0.0001) and had larger bicaudate indices (difference between means 0.023, t = 3.54, df = 140, p = 0.0007) than patients without leukoaraiosis. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the effects of age and leukoaraiosis were independent. No effect of lesion type (cortical or lacunar infarct, or both) on bicaudate index could be demonstrated. Larger values for the bicaudate index were associated with a predominantly anterior location of leukoaraiosis. The frontal horn and occipital horn indices increased with age, but we could not find an effect of leukoaraiosis on these indices. \nCanadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation (CAFA) Study. The Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation Study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the potential of warfarin to reduce systemic thromboembolism and its inherent risk of hemorrhage. As a result of the publication of two other \"positive\" studies of similar design and objective, this study was stopped early before completion of its planned recruitment of 630 patients. There were 187 patients randomized to warfarin and 191 to placebo. Permanent discontinuation of study medication occurred in 26% of warfarin-treated and 23% of placebo-treated patients. The target range of the international normalized ratio was 2 to 3. For the warfarin-treated patients, the international normalized ratio was in the target range 43.7% of the study days, above it 16.6% of the study days and below it 39.6% of the study days. Fatal or major bleeding occurred at annual rates of 2.5% in warfarin-treated and 0.5% in placebo-treated patients. Minor bleeding occurred in 16% of patients receiving warfarin and 9% receiving placebo. The primary outcome event cluster was nonlacunar stroke, noncentral nervous systemic embolism and fatal or intracranial hemorrhage. Events were included in the primary analysis of efficacy if they occurred within 28 days of permanent discontinuation of the study medication. The annual rates of the primary outcome event cluster were 3.5% in warfarin-treated and 5.2% in placebo-treated patients, with a relative risk reduction of 37% (95% confidence limits, -63.5%, 75.5%, p = 0.17). \nThe importance of adequate anticoagulation to prevent early thrombosis after stenting of stenosed venous bypass grafts. Stent implantation in native coronary arteries may be complicated by acute thrombosis, despite the use of stringent anticoagulation. Thrombotic occlusion of stented venous grafts may occur less frequently, possibly because of the larger caliber of these grafts. We report our experience with 46 stents (Wallstent, Medinvent, Lausanne, Switzerland) implanted in 35 lesions of 24 consecutive patients (mean age 64 years, range 43 to 75). Two overlapping stents were implanted in seven patients, and three overlapping stents were positioned in two. After implantation, activated partial thromboplastin time was maintained at two to three times the control level by intravenous administration of heparin (160 to 550 mg daily) until thrombotest values were reduced 5% to 10% by acenocoumarol. Impending thrombotic occlusion was recognized in two suboptimally anticoagulated patients: patient A after implantation of four stents and patient B after anticoagulation therapy was discontinued because of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed successfully in both patients. A third patient had a myocardial infarction on day 7 after stent implantation, in spite of adequate anticoagulation and optimal medical drug therapy. It is concluded that stringent anticoagulation therapy appears mandatory to maintain graft patency after stent implantation. \nBlood pressure during pregnancy in Canadian Inuit: community differences related to diet. OBJECTIVE: To assess a possible relation between the incidence of hypertension during pregnancy and the consumption of fatty acids found in fish and sea mammals. DESIGN: Retrospective survey of pregnancy-induced hypertension; prospective diet survey. SETTING: Inuit women from seven communities in the Keewatin region of the Northwest Territories. PATIENTS: All women from Arviat (formerly Eskimo Point), Baker Lake, Chesterfield Inlet, Coral Harbour, Repulse Bay, Sanikiluaq and Whale Cove who gave birth between Sept. 1, 1984, and Aug. 31, 1987. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All blood pressure measurements recorded during the pregnancy, incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension in the seven communities, harvest of country food (food obtained from the land or sea rather than bought in a store) for six of the communities, self-reported consumption of fish, sea mammals and terrestrial mammals by a subgroup of the subjects and levels of phospholipid fatty acids in cord serum samples from a subgroup of the infants. MAIN RESULTS: Significantly lower mean diastolic blood pressure values during the last 6 hours of pregnancy were noted for the women from the three communities with a higher consumption of fish and sea mammals (78.2 [95% confidence limits (CL) 76.6 and 79.9] mm Hg) than for those from the four communities with a lower consumption of such food (81.5 [95% CL 80.1 and 82.9] mm Hg) (p less than 0.005). The relation between community diet type and blood pressure was independent of other factors. Correspondingly, the women from communities with a lower consumption of marine food were 2.6 times more likely to be hypertensive during the pregnancy than those from communities with a higher consumption of marine food (p less than 0.007). Parity (p less than 0.05) and prepregnancy weight (p less than 0.005) were also significantly associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension; however, the relation between hypertension and community diet type remained significant in logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 2.56, p = 0.03). The differences between the community groups were substantiated by the results of the diet survey, the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the cord serum phospholipids and the harvest data. CONCLUSIONS: Increased consumption of fish may be beneficial for women at risk for hypertension during pregnancy. A prospective randomized trial of fish or EPA supplementation during pregnancy is warranted. \nPrevention of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation in cystic fibrosis by early treatment. To assess whether chronic pulmonary colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis is preventable, 26 patients who had never received anti-pseudomonas chemotherapy were randomly allocated to groups receiving either no anti-pseudomonas chemotherapy or oral ciprofloxacin and aerosol inhalations of colistin twice daily for 3 weeks, whenever Ps aeruginosa was isolated from routine sputum cultures. During the 27 months of the trial, infection with Ps aeruginosa became chronic in significantly fewer treated than untreated subjects (2 [14%] vs 7 [58%]; p less than 0.05) and there were significantly fewer Ps aeruginosa isolates in routine sputum cultures in the treated group (49/214 [23%] vs 64/158 [41%]; p = 0.0006). Thus, chronic colonisation with Ps aeruginosa can be prevented in cystic fibrosis by early institution of anti-pseudomonas chemotherapy. \nPrimary biliary cirrhosis: relation between hepatic function and pulmonary function in patients who never smoked. We studied the relationship between selected variables of hepatic and pulmonary function in 47 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, who were participating in a prospective study to assess sequential pulmonary function at yearly intervals. An additional 20 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, who were liver transplant candidates awaiting transplantation, were studied. None of the 67 patients ever smoked cigarettes. Severity of primary biliary cirrhosis was characterized by histological stage and the Mayo risk score derived from a Cox regression model that used the following variables: serum bilirubin and serum albumin levels, age, prothrombin time and clinical severity of edema. Pulmonary function assessment included key variables describing expiratory airflow (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec divided by forced vital capacity) and efficiency of gas exchange (steady-state diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide). We found a significant relationship between histological stage of primary biliary cirrhosis and steady-state diffusing capacity (p = 0.02) and between the Mayo risk score for disease severity and steady-state diffusing capacity (p = 0.03). Progressive deterioration of steady-state diffusing capacity was associated with increasing severity of primary biliary cirrhosis. No relationship existed between pulmonary function and the presence of sicca complex or Sjogren's syndrome or the clinical manifestations of portal hypertension (e.g., esophageal varices, ascites and splenomegaly). No significant relationship existed between expiratory airflow and severity of primary biliary cirrhosis. We conclude that in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who have never smoked, a statistically significant relationship exists between the severity of the liver disease and the efficiency of gas exchange measured by steady-state diffusing capacity. \nAccess to health care. One neurologist's perspective. Millions of residents of the United States have difficulty obtaining health care. Barriers impeding access to care include poverty, physical unavailability of health care services, absence of health insurance, and physicians unwilling to care for uninsured patients. Many patients do not successfully use health services because of educational, cultural, and language barriers. A major access barrier is lack of health insurance. Over 30 million people in the United States have none, the so-called medically indigent. Among them are over 3 million people with neurologic disorders. They have additional barriers to overcome because often they cannot work, cannot drive, have difficulty using public transportation, and have major cognitive and communication impairments. Medical and governmental bodies are debating solutions to the health care access crisis. Physicians should actively participate in this national debate. Neurologists should address the special needs of patients with neurological disorders. \nEffects of enflurane on inducibility of ventricular tachycardia. The effects of enflurane on cardiac electrophysiologic parameters and on inducibility of ventricular tachycardia (VT) by programmed stimulation were studied in 12 patients (11 men, 1 woman, mean age +/- standard deviation 55 +/- 8 years) with drug refractory sustained monomorphic VT who underwent transcatheter ablation with high-energy direct-current shocks. One catheter ablation procedure was performed in 10 patients, whereas 2 ablation sessions were necessary in 2 patients. Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed on 2 separate days (mean interval 19). There were 2 baseline studies, 1 several days before (\"baseline study I\") and the second at the beginning of the ablation procedure (\"baseline study II\") while the patient was awake and nonsedated. The third programmed stimulation study was done 15 to 30 minutes after administration of anesthesia with enflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide (\"enflurane study\"). Rate of sinus rhythm, QRS duration, PQ interval and ventricular effective refractory period were unaltered, whereas QTc interval increased significantly after initiation of anesthesia. Before and after induction of general anesthesia, clinical VT was inducible in all patients. However, in 1 patient, induction of VT was only possible by pacing in the left ventricle after enflurane administration. Based on these data, it is concluded that general anesthesia with enflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide has no marked influence on inducibility of clinical VTs. Therefore, this type of anesthesia may be useful for nonpharmacologic, ablative procedures requiring general anesthesia. \nEndometrial adenocarcinoma in Norway. A study of a total population. Fifteen hundred sixty-six patients with adenocarcinoma of the endometrioid type (AC) were studied. These accounted for 78.9% of all 1985 patients with confirmed endometrial carcinoma diagnosed in Norway in the period 1970 through 1978. Four hundred and sixty-nine patients (29.9%) had well-differentiated tumors, 677 (43.2%) were moderately and 420 (26.8%) poorly differentiated. Eighty-one percent of the patients had surgicopathologic Stage I disease, 11% Stage II, 6% Stage III, and 2% Stage IV. Mean age at diagnosis was 62.1 years (range, 36 to 91). The crude 5-year and 10-year survival rates for all patients were 74.1% and 62.2%, respectively. Five-year crude survival was 86.8% for Grade 1 and 58.3% for Grade 3 tumors. The 5-year crude survival for patients with intramucosal tumors was 88.7% as opposed to 46.9% for patients with tumors infiltrating to the serosa. Sixty-six percent of the patients with vessel invasion survived for 5 years in contrast to 88.6% for patients without vessel invasion. Histologic grade, myometrial infiltration, vessel invasion, and lymphocyte reaction surrounding the tumor were strongly interrelated. Multivariate analysis showed that the age of the patient at the time of diagnosis was the most important single prognostic factor. Disregarding age, survival in operated patients was more dependent on the depth of myometrial invasion than on grade and stage of disease. \nPain threshold levels and coping strategies among patients who have chest pain and normal coronary arteries. Patients with noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) tend to show lower pain threshold levels for esophageal balloon distention than do patients with other painful gastrointestinal disorders and healthy controls. The NCCP patients also report greater usage of negative pain-coping strategies, less ability to perform specific behaviors to decrease pain, and higher levels of clinical pain than do other patient and healthy control groups. Behavioral treatments produce significant decreases in pain and disruption of daily activities. Further effort is needed, however, to develop treatments for NCCP that are based on knowledge of the behavioral manifestations of this disorder and the afferent mechanisms involved in perception of visceral pain. \nPeriosteal suspension of the lower eyelid and cheek following subciliary exposure of facial fractures. Following craniofacial procedures that involve stripping of the periosteum and soft tissue over the zygomatic maxillary complex, descent of soft tissue with a decrease in anterior projection over the malar area and increase in fullness in the nasolabial fold have been seen to be a problem by these authors. Simple repositioning of the soft tissues to their normal anatomic position may be used to alleviate this problem. \nNoncemented porous-coated anatomic total hip arthroplasty. In 1984, as an alternate to the acrylic fixation of the components of total hip arthroplasty, the use of an uncemented porous-coated anatomic (PCA) hip system with a beaded porous coating to achieve biologic fixation was initiated. Since then, 44 patients with cementless acetabular components and 35 patients with cementless femoral components have been followed for a minimum of 24 months and an average of 37 months. Harris hip scores averaged 90.5 at most recent follow-up intervals. No reoperations were necessary for failures of fixation or change in position of the acetabular component. Ominous roentgenographic signs such as progressive bead shedding, progressive radiolucencies, or progressive component migration have not occurred. Two femoral component revisions have been necessary: one for intractable pain and one for pain and roentgenographic loosening. Although thigh pain has been prevalent (20%), all patients have been accommodated and have retained stable hip scores. Progressive radiolucencies and progressive implant subsidence have been rare occurrences. The authors continue to use the cementless acetabular component in all cases of total hip arthroplasty in which initial stability can be obtained. It is their preference to cement the femoral component in patients over 65 or when initial stability cannot be achieved. \nImmunologic effects of interferon. Interferons can be defined as a family of induced proteins sharing the capacity to exert pleiotropic effects on cell functions and to render cells resistant to virus infection. They are activating genes coding for a number of enzymes, most of which have not yet been characterized, and also by enhancing the synthesis of cell surface components. This enables interferons to modulate the immune response at different levels. This article will focus on the effects of interferon on antigen presentation, regulation of the immune response, activation of macrophage functions, and on its role in the pathogenesis of some diseases. \nClinical implications of seizures in neurosarcoidosis. Seizures are a recognized manifestation of neurosarcoidosis, but their clinical relevance is not well established. We reviewed the characteristics, clinical correlations, and prognosis of seizures in 79 patients with neurosarcoidosis. Thirteen (15%) of the 79 patients had seizures, and in eight patients (10%) a seizure was the first manifestation of neurosarcoidosis. These seizures were generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 12 patients (92%) and partial seizures in four patients (31%). The patients with neurosarcoidosis with seizures were more likely to have a progressive or relapsing clinical course and intracranial mass lesions (four patients [31%]), encephalopathy or vasculopathy (eight patients [62%]), or hydrocephalus (five patients [38%]). These central nervous system disorders, rather than the seizures per se, were responsible for most of the serious morbidity and the two deaths (15%) among our patients with seizures. Indeed seizure control was good in 11 (85%) of 13 patients treated with combinations of steroids and antiepileptic medications. Seizures are an important sign in neurosarcoidosis because they are associated with more severe and progressive or relapsing forms of central nervous system sarcoidosis and may be an early manifestation of such disorders. \nSmall hepatocellular carcinoma treated with percutaneous ethanol injection: MR imaging findings. Fifty-seven magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations were obtained at 0.5 T in 19 patients before and after percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) for 23 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions less than 3.5 cm in diameter. Seventeen patients also underwent MR imaging 6 months after completion of therapy. In 11 patients, computed tomography was performed before and after treatment. After PEI, fine-needle biopsy specimens were obtained in all cases. Before treatment, HCC lesions had low signal intensity on T1-weighted images in 13 cases, had the same signal intensity as normal liver parenchyma in six, and had high signal intensity in four; all 23 tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. After treatment and at 6-month follow-up, all 21 lesions that contained no malignant cells at fine-needle biopsy had high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and had low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The remaining two HCC lesions in which tumor necrosis was not achieved with PEI displayed a different MR pattern, since the residual neoplastic tissue showed no change in signal intensity on either T1- or T2-weighted images. The authors conclude that MR imaging may be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of PEI in achieving tumor regression. \nNicotine induced gastric injury. A quantitative macroscopic and microscopic analysis of the protective effects of sucralfate and feeding. Nicotine, while an important component of cigarettes, does not cause gross gastric mucosal damage, although its microscopic effect remains unknown. We have evaluated the histology and the microvascular permeability of (a) the effect of nicotine alone or in combination with ethanol on the gastric mucosa of rats and (b) the effect of feeding and sucralfate on the mucosa of rats treated with nicotine and ethanol. Mucosal injury was assessed histologically by the depth of injury and microvascular permeability by the leakage of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled albumin. Our results show that nicotine induced microscopic mucosal damage and accentuated the damage induced by alcohol. The damaging effects on mucosa of nicotine and ethanol, alone or in combination, were reduced by pretreatment with sucralfate. Similarly, feeding reduced the degree of mucosal injury. Nicotine and ethanol increased leakage of albumin into the interstitium and the leakage was reduced after sucralfate pretreatment. This study substantiates the adverse effect of smoking on mucosal damage. Vascular factors are probably involved in the pathogenesis. \nCharacterization of human renal fibroblasts in health and disease: II. In vitro growth, differentiation, and collagen synthesis of fibroblasts from kidneys with interstitial fibrosis. Fibroblast cultures from normal human kidneys (NKF cells) and kidneys affected with interstitial fibrosis (FKIF cells) were analyzed for in vitro growth, differentiation dynamics, and collagen synthesis. FKIF cells are characterized by hyperproliferative growth, resulting in a prolonged mitotic lifespan, by an altered differentiation pattern, and by the expression of the FKIF cell-specific protein \"fibrosin\" (molecular weight 53 kd, isoelectric point [pi] 6.1). Furthermore, FKIF cells synthesize four to five times more total collagen per cell as compared with NKF cells, and the relative amounts of the collagen types produced (type I, III, and V) are significantly different from controls. Thus, the in vitro cell system of FKIF cells may help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms triggering the induction and progression of renal interstitial fibrosis in vivo. \nDeformity correction and long-term survival in an infant with iniencephaly. Case report. The authors describe the case of a male infant who was diagnosed prenatally as having iniencephaly. Since birth, the child has grown, thrived, and undergone two successful operations to correct his cervical deformity. This case demonstrates that the iniencephaly defect is not uniformly fatal and that neurosurgical intervention may offer significant improvement in the cervical deformity. \nCircadian variation in the frequency of onset of chest pain in acute myocardial infarction. The time of onset of chest pain was studied prospectively in 1154 consecutive patients admitted to a coronary care unit with myocardial infarction during a five year period. Statistical analysis confirmed a previous finding in a retrospective study of a bimodal frequency distribution with peaks in the time of onset of chest pain between 2330 and 0030 hours and between 0630 and 0830 hours. \nAngiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, regional vascular hemodynamics, and the development and prevention of experimental genetic hypertension. During the development of hypertension in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) vascular resistance is increased, particularly in the renal circulation, and, to a lesser extent, in the splanchnic bed. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in young SHR reverses the renovascular abnormalities more effectively than simple vasodilators, suggesting that the resistance changes may depend on angiotensin II. Perindopril treatment during the development of hypertension causes a reduction in blood pressure as a result of a fall in total peripheral resistance, which persists long after treatment is stopped. These long-term effects can be prevented by replacing angiotensin during perindopril treatment. Not all organs share the long-term resistance changes following perindopril treatment, which are most marked in the renal, splanchnic, and cerebral circulations. The heterogeneous patterns of regional vascular resistance during the development and after prevention of hypertension with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in SHR suggest that local factors, for example, angiotensin II related to the tissue renin-angiotensin system or local adrenergic activity, may be important in the genesis of high blood pressure in this genetic model. \nIs premedication with oral glycopyrrolate as effective as oral atropine in attenuating cardiovascular depression in infants receiving halothane for induction of anesthesia? The authors conducted a double-blind study to compare premedication with oral glycopyrrolate and oral atropine in prevention of bradycardia and hypotension during induction of anesthesia with halothane-N2O in 90 outpatient infants and children aged 1-18 mo who were randomized into three groups to receive either an oral placebo, oral atropine (0.02 mg/kg), or oral glycopyrrolate (0.05 mg/kg) approximately 1 h before induction of anesthesia. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were measured before drug administration, just before induction of anesthesia, and every minute until surgical stimulation occurred. Glycopyrrolate, at the dose used, was significantly less effective than atropine in attenuating bradycardia during induction; neither glycopyrrolate nor atropine altered the incidence or degree of hypotension. Antisialagogic activity and side effects were comparable, except for significantly more flushing with atropine. \nCase report: epidural and bilateral retroorbital hematomas complicating sickle cell anemia. Early in the course of a painful crisis, a 19-year-old man with known sickle cell anemia (SCA) developed a clinical picture that resembled either early cavernous sinus thrombosis or retroorbital and bifrontal microinfarcts. A brain computer tomography scan demonstrated bilateral retroorbital hemorrhages along with a left frontal epidural hematoma. In the absence of trauma, thrombocytopenia, or any other detectable hemostatic defect, this type of hemorrhagic manifestation in the setting of SCA has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported in the literature. \nClassic and vigorous achalasia: a comparison of manometric, radiographic, and clinical findings. Compared with classic achalasia, vigorous achalasia has been defined as achalasia with relatively high esophageal contraction amplitudes, often with minimal esophageal dilation and prominent tertiary contractions on radiographs, and with the presence of chest pain. However, no study using current manometric techniques has compared manometric, radiographic, and clinical findings in vigorous and classic achalasia or questioned the usefulness of making this distinction. Fifty-four cases involving patients with achalasia whose radiographic and manometric studies were performed within 6 months of each other were available for review. Patients with vigorous achalasia (n = 17), defined by amplitude greater than or equal to 37 mm Hg, and patients with classic achalasia (n = 37), defined as amplitude less than 37 mm Hg, had substantial overlap in radiographic parameters of esophageal dilation, tortuosity, and tertiary contractions. Manometric properties of repetitive waves and lower esophageal sphincter pressure and clinical aspects of chest pain, dysphagia, heartburn, and satisfactory responses to pneumatic dilation were similar in both forms of achalasia. A separate analysis of patients with mean contraction amplitude greater than 60 mm Hg revealed similar findings. It is concluded that use of amplitude as a criterion for classifying achalasia is arbitrary and of dubious value. \nPrevalence of obesity in American Indians and Alaska Natives. Obesity is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and non-insulin-dependent diabetes, which are chronic diseases that afflict American Indians and Alaska Natives today. Because American Indians are not represented in most national health and nutrition surveys, there is a paucity of data on actual prevalence of obesity in American Indians. We estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity for American Indian adults, school-age children, and preschool children from existing data. The prevalence of obesity in adults was estimated from self-reported weights and heights obtained from a special survey of American Indians performed as part of the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey. Prevalence of obesity in American Indians was 13.7% for men and 16.5% for women, which was higher than the US rates of 9.1% and 8.2%, respectively. Obesity rates in American Indian adolescents and preschool children were higher than the respective rates for US all-races combined. \nDipyridamole echocardiography test. A new tool for detecting jeopardized myocardium after thrombolytic therapy. BACKGROUND. We wished to assess whether dipyridamole echocardiography test (DET) can detect jeopardized myocardium after thrombolytic therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Seventy-six consecutive patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were treated with 2 million IU urokinase i.v. within 4 hours of the onset of AMI and underwent high-dose (as much as 0.84 mg/kg over 10 minutes) DET 8-10 days after AMI. The results were correlated to the anatomy of the infarct-related vessel (IRV). In patients with positive DET, we evaluated the wall motion score index (WMSI; a semiquantitative integrated estimation of extent and severity of the stress-induced dyssynergy). WMSI was derived by summation of individual segment scores divided by the number of interpreted segments. In a 13-segment model, each segment was assigned a score ranging from 1 (normal) to 4 (dyskinetic). Fifty-three patients had positive results on DET. Of these, 42 had dipyridamole-induced new wall motion abnormalities (WMAs) confined to the infarct zone or adjacent segments. In these patients, mean WMSI increased from 1.46 +/- 0.26 (at resting conditions) to 1.73 +/- 0.35 (at peak dipyridamole) (p less than 0.01), whereas no significant change was detected in negative patients (1.6 +/- 0.34 versus 1.57 +/- 0.34, p = NS). Coronary angiography showed a patent IRV (TIMI grade 2 or 3) in 53 patients and no or minimal reperfusion (TIMI grade 0 or 1) in 23 patients. A patent IRV with critical residual stenosis was found in 35 of 42 patients with dipyridamole-induced WMAs in the infarct zone and in 18 of 34 patients without WMAs (p less than 0.05). Among the 23 patients with occluded IRVs, nine had collateral flow to the distal vessel; six of these had a positive DET. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying a critically stenotic but patent IRV or the presence of a collateral-dependent zone were 66% and 93%, respectively. In a subset of nine patients with a positive DET in the infarct zone or adjacent segments, DET and a control coronary angiography were repeated 1-3 months after an angiographically successful (residual stenosis, 50% or less) coronary angioplasty in the IRV. The repeat DET was negative in eight patients (all with patent IRV at control angiography) and again positive in one patient, who showed restenosis at angiography. The WMSI, at resting conditions was similar before and after angioplasty, whereas it differed significantly at peak dipyridamole (1.7 +/- 0.2 versus 1.4 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. DET can identify the anatomy of the IRV, and dipyridamole-induced WMAs within the infarct zone detect regions with jeopardized myocardium that may benefit from intervention. \nSymptoms associated with tamoxifen treatment in postmenopausal women. Adjuvant breast cancer therapy with tamoxifen is associated with greater disease-free survival and possibly overall survival. Long-term treatment, possibly of indefinite duration, is being evaluated. Compliance with long-term therapy will depend largely on the nature and severity of tamoxifen's side effects. We evaluated the symptoms associated with tamoxifen therapy in 140 postmenopausal women with axillary node negative breast cancer in remission (mean years since menopause, 9.3) enrolled in a placebo-controlled, randomized toxicity study. Tamoxifen recipients reported moderated or severe vasomotor symptoms up to 17%, and gynecologic symptoms up to 4% more frequently than placebo subjects. Persistent vasomotor, gynecologic, or other major side effects were reported by 48% of tamoxifen recipients, and by 21% of placebo subjects. These carefully collected data suggest significant perceived symptom 'cost' of tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women, of a magnitude likely to compromise long-term compliance. \nPrognostic factors in Japanese patients with colorectal cancer: the significance of large bowel obstruction--univariate and multivariate analyses. In order to define prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma, univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out on data from 113 Japanese patients treated in a typical general hospital in Japan. In the univariate analysis, a poor prognosis was seen in those with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, in tumors that perforated the visceral peritoneum or that invaded directly other organs or structures (T4), in metastasis to the nodes along the main vascular pedicle (N3), in lymphatic permeation, in blood vessel invasion, in peritoneal dissemination, in Dukes C stage, and in those with lesions presenting with large bowel obstruction. Of these, only lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination had an independent prognostic significance when a multivariate Cox analysis was performed. The significant risk factors related to an obstructing tumor were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The significant variables were patient's age, nodal involvement and peritoneal dissemination. Since lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination proved significant in both multivariate analyses, we propose that the presence of large bowel obstruction is not an independent prognostic factor in patients with colorectal carcinoma. In poor-risk patients who have an obstructing tumor, a staged operation should be attempted for definitive curative surgery. \nLoiasis in endemic and nonendemic populations: immunologically mediated differences in clinical presentation. To define the clinical spectrum of loiasis more precisely and to begin to assess the immunologic basis for the difference in clinical manifestations between visitors to endemic areas and natives of these areas, 51 West African patients with loiasis were evaluated and compared with 42 infected expatriates. Microfilaremia was present in 90% and Calabar swellings in only 16% of the endemic patients. Conversely, only 10% of the expatriates were microfilaremic while 95% complained of Calabar swellings. The endemic population showed significantly decreased levels of peripheral blood eosinophils, parasite-specific IgG, and lymphocyte proliferation to parasite antigens compared with the nonendemic population. These findings support the hypothesis that differences in the modulation of the immune response to parasite antigen are responsible for the observed differences in clinical presentation between expatriate and endemic populations with loiasis. \nPrevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in elderly patients in a primary care setting. Despite the aging of our population, there remains a paucity of information about gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in the elderly. To assess the prevalence and characteristics of GER within this patient population, questionnaires evaluating symptoms associated with GER were administered to 313 consecutive patients 62 yr old or older from a primary care setting. Fourteen percent of these patients reported having at least weekly heartburn. Ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring was accomplished in 54 of the 313 patients surveyed. Twenty percent (11/54) of this subgroup exhibited increased acid contact time (pH less than 4 for more than 6% of the monitoring period). Twenty-two percent (12/54) complained of heartburn, yet only six individuals (11%) exhibited both symptomatic and objective indications of acid reflux. Surprisingly, 31% (17/54) of the patients studied exhibited significant alkalinity within the distal esophagus (pH greater than 8 for greater than 1.5% of the monitoring period). Whereas 29% of these patients (5/17) reported heartburn, 40% of those reporting heartburn (2/5) had acid GER as well as excessive alkalinity. In contrast to patients with acid GER--none of whom reported pulmonary symptoms--24% (4/17) of these patients with esophageal alkalinity reported wheezing, nocturnal cough, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Of the four patients with significant distal esophageal exposure to both acid and alkali, two reported heartburn and a third reported dysphagia. In addition to the somewhat higher prevalence of acid reflux than anticipated, a surprisingly high prevalence of esophageal alkalinity was observed. \nAvailability and use of hepatitis B vaccine in laboratory and nursing schools in the United States. Hepatitis B is a well-documented occupational hazard for health care workers, including both laboratory and nursing personnel. Since the development of effective hepatitis B vaccines, the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) has recommended that health care workers receive the vaccine. In this study, 78 laboratory training programs and 83 nursing training programs were surveyed regarding availability and usage of hepatitis B vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine was made available to students in 81 percent of the laboratory programs and 23 percent of the nursing programs. In those programs making the vaccine available, only 59 percent of the laboratory programs and 5 percent of the nursing programs reported a high (greater than 75 percent) use by students. Concern about cost and payment for the vaccine was the most common reason (80 percent) noted by laboratory schools that did not have hepatitis B vaccination programs for students. Of the nursing schools that did not have vaccine programs, 58 percent had not yet considered a program. At laboratory schools with vaccination programs, who paid for the vaccine (hospital or school versus student) was among the most important determinants for vaccine usage by students. These findings point out that some laboratory schools and many nursing schools have not applied the ACIP recommendations to their own programs. Educational efforts and creative payment plans for the vaccine are needed to increase the availability and use of hepatitis B vaccine among laboratory and nursing students. \nAnalysis of retroviral sequences in the spinal form of multiple sclerosis. The polymerase chain reaction was used, in a blind study, to look for retroviral sequences in DNA extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 11 patients with the spinal form of multiple sclerosis (MS). Control subjects consisted of 7 patients with other neurological diseases and 5 healthy blood donors. Three sets of oligonucleotides were used. They could detect all known human oncoretroviruses, lentiviruses, or spumaretroviruses. The primers recognized conserved sequences in the long terminal repeats of the proviral DNA. Control experiments showed that the primers crossreacted within the human immunodeficiency virus or human T-cell lymphotropic virus group and that they provided the expected level of sensitivity. Therefore the assay could have detected not only known human retroviruses but also new related members. In spite of this, no retroviral sequences were detected in either the MS or the control specimen. \nA controlled clinical trial of E5 murine monoclonal IgM antibody to endotoxin in the treatment of gram-negative sepsis. The XOMA Sepsis Study Group OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of adjunctive monoclonal antibody antiendotoxin immunotherapy in patients with gram-negative sepsis. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Thirty-three university-affiliated centers, including Veterans Affairs, community, and municipal hospitals. PATIENTS: Hospitalized adults with signs of gram-negative infection and a systemic septic response. INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned to receive either 2 mg/kg of a murine monoclonal antibody directed against gram-negative endotoxin (E5) or placebo. A second infusion was administered 24 hours later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality over the 30-day study period, resolution of organ failures, and safety. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-six patients were enrolled. Three hundred sixteen had confirmed gram-negative sepsis (54% bacteremic, 46% nonbacteremic). The survival difference was not statistically significant for all patients. Among patients with gram-negative sepsis who were not in shock at study entry (n = 137), E5 treatment resulted in significantly greater survival (relative risk, 2.3; P = .01). Resolution of individual organ failures was more frequent among these patients, occurring in 19 (54%) of 35 patients in the E5 group vs eight (30%) of 27 in the placebo group (P = .05). Four reversible allergic reactions occurred among 247 patients (1.6%) receiving E5. No other toxicity was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with E5 antiendotoxin antibody appears safe. It reduces mortality and enhances the resolution of organ failure among patients with gram-negative sepsis who are not in shock when treated. \nPrevention of insulitis and diabetes onset by treatment with complete Freund's adjuvant in NOD mice. In studies of immune cell defects in autoimmune diabetes mellitus, we observed that complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) prevented the onset of diabetes when injected into 8- to 10-wk-old prediabetic nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. The prevalence of the onset of diabetes in the CFA-injected versus uninjected NOD mice was 2 of 81 (2.5%) vs. 231 of 379 (61%) among females and 2 of 44 (4.5%) vs. 83 of 336 (25%) among males, respectively. The incidence of histologically identifiable insulitis was significantly reduced in CFA-treated prediabetic female NOD mice (18%) compared with the incidence in female age-matched controls (70%). Splenocytes or Mac-(1+)-enriched splenocytes from CFA-treated NOD mice, when cotransferred with splenocytes from diabetic mice, reduced the incidence of diabetes provoked by diabetic splenocytes in vivo. In the spleen, CFA injection induced sustained increases in cell proliferation and an associated major increase in the numbers of an immature cell type that expressed the Mac-1 surface antigen. In CFA-treated NOD mice, lymphocytes derived from the spleen failed to respond in vitro to stimulation by the mitogen concanavalin A or by anti-CD3. When cocultured, Mac-1+ cells, enriched from the splenocytes of CFA-treated mice, suppressed concanavalin A- or anti-CD3-induced proliferation of T lymphocytes derived from either the spleen or thymus of untreated NOD mice. Therefore, treatment with CFA prevents the development of diabetes, and concomitantly, insulitis while stimulating the generation of splenic suppressor cells that are capable of suppressing diabetogenic T-lymphocyte function in vivo and in vitro. \nIntermittent injection vs patient-controlled analgesia for sickle cell crisis pain. Comparison in patients in the emergency department. BACKGROUND.--The purpose of this study is a prospective assessment of morphine sulfate administration by intermittent intravenous (IV) injections (Int-IV) vs patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in patients in the emergency department (ED) with sickle cell crisis pain. METHODS.--Patients were at bed rest and received intravenous hydration. Linear analog scale for pain intensity and verbal pain scale, level of alertness, and vital signs were assessed prior to therapy, every 60 minutes thereafter, and at the time of discharge from the ED. Patients were randomized to Int-IV or PCA. During phase 1, patients in the Int-IV group received morphine sulfate 4 mg IV every 30 to 60 minutes as necessary for a linear analog scale for pain intensity greater than 50 mm. The patients in the PCA group received morphine sulfate 2 mg bolus then 1.0 mg with a 6-minute lockout. During phase 2, patients in the Int-IV group received morphine sulfate 8 mg IV every 30 to 60 minutes as necessary for a linear analog scale for pain intensity greater than 50 mm. The patients in the PCA group received morphine sulfate 5 mg bolus then 2.7 mg with a 10-minute lockout. Data were analyzed by unpaired t test, general linear modeling, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi 2 test. RESULTS.--During phase 1, 10 patients (28.3 +/- 7.3 years) received Int-IV and 10 patients (33.9 +/- 12.5 years) received PCA. Treatment groups did not differ significantly regarding duration of pain, amount of morphine administered, linear analog scale for pain intensity, verbal pain scale, level of alertness, or vital signs except for a significantly lower final respiratory rate with Int-IV. In phase 2, 12 patients (28.4 +/- 5.6 years) received Int-IV and 13 patients (26.8 +/- 8.1 years) received PCA. The PCA groups had a significantly shorter elapsed time between onset of pain and treatment (7.3 +/- 6.5 hours) when compared with the Int-IV group (18 +/- 16.9 hours). Treatment groups did not differ significantly with respect to total amount of morphine administered, linear analog scale for pain intensity, verbal pain scale, vital signs, or level of alertness. The PCA group had a significant reduction in length of stay in the ED during phase 2 when compared with phase 1. The ED discharge rate and the incidence of side effects did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSION.--At both the low- and high-dose regimens, PCA is equally safe and effective and may be used in place of Int-IV administration of morphine in the ED treatment of sickle cell crisis pain. \nAlcohol consumption of patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias other than atrial fibrillation. We studied the recent alcohol consumption and other possible precipitating factors in 99 consecutive patients (53 men and 46 women) all under 65 years of age with sustained re-entry and automatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and compared them with those of two groups of controls. One control group was derived from the Emergency Room patients and matched for age and sex; the other group (44 men, 22 women, mean age 48.7 years) was randomly selected from the general out-of-hospital population. There were 50 patients with supraventricular tachycardia, 30 with atrial flutter, and 19 with paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. Coronary heart disease (14% of patients), hypertension (10%), and dilated cardiomyopathy (6%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases associated with the arrhythmias. The self-reported alcohol consumption of patients with arrhythmias during the week preceding the arrhythmia did not differ significantly from that of hospital or population controls, although significantly more patients than controls had liver enzyme levels above normal; neither were there any significant differences between the groups regarding prevalence for alcoholism as judged by the CAGE questionnaire. The results were essentially similar when patients with supraventricular tachycardia and those with intra-atrial tachyarrhythmias (flutter and paroxysmal tachycardia) were separately compared with the controls. We conclude that alcohol consumption, although a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, is not associated with the induction of other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients of working age. \nMineral spirits inhalation associated with hemolysis, pulmonary edema, and ventricular fibrillation. A previously healthy 42-year-old woman developed severe dyspnea, chest discomfort, and malaise several hours after prolonged exposure to concentrated vapors from mineral spirits. On the way to the hospital, she sustained a cardiopulmonary arrest; on arrival several minutes later, she was found to be in ventricular fibrillation and was resuscitated. Her hospital course included slowly resolving cardiac abnormalities, amnesia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, abrupt hemolytic anemia, sustained rhabdomyolysis, and other metabolic abnormalities. It is highly probable that this syndrome represented acute and near-lethal toxicity caused by the inhalational exposure to the petroleum distillate known as mineral spirits. It is important that physicians be aware of this syndrome in order to recognize it on presentation and to warn patients of the risk of such toxic exposure. \nRefractory chronic bacterial prostatitis: a re-evaluation of ciprofloxacin treatment after a median followup of 30 months. A total of 16 men suffering from refractory chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by Escherichia coli was treated with ciprofloxacin for 4 weeks. After a median followup of 30 months (range 21 to 36 months) 10 of the 16 patients were considered cured as judged by bacteriological results and clinical symptoms. In 2 men a second ciprofloxacin regimen obviously showed success also. In 2 patients ciprofloxacin therapy failed and in 2 therapy had to be discontinued due to side effects of the central nervous system. \nPrevention and treatment of pregnancy-associated hypertension: what have we learned in the last 10 years? High blood pressure (BP) complicates approximately 10% of all pregnancies. Hypertension in pregnancy falls into four categories: (1) preeclampsia-eclampsia, (2) chronic hypertension of whatever cause, (3) preeclampsia-eclampsia superimposed to chronic hypertension or renal disease, and (4) transient or late hypertension (gestational hypertension). Preeclampsia, the association of hypertension, proteinuria, and edema, accounts for more than 50% of all the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and is a major cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, distinguishing between preeclampsia and other causes of hypertension on clinical grounds can be difficult because of the lack of specific tests for differential diagnosis. Increased vascular resistance has been claimed as the primary cause of preeclampsia; however, a variable hemodynamic profile with relatively high cardiac outputs, normal filling pressures, and inappropriately high systemic vascular resistances is now reported by most investigators. Imbalance between vasodilator and vasoconstrictor eicosanoids may account for platelet activation and increased responsiveness to pressor peptides. Altered prostacyclin (PGI2) to thromboxane A2 (TxA2) ratio in maternal uteroplacental vascular bed may favor local platelet activation and vasoconstriction contributing to placental insufficiency and fetal distress. Alternatively, recent evidence seems to suggest that fetal umbilical placental circulation may be the site of the primary vascular injury. Whether low-dose aspirin prevents preeclampsia because it inhibits the excessive maternal TxA2 or whether the partial inhibition of fetal TxA2 is also of therapeutic value remains to be established. Treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is probably important to prevent cardiac failure or cerebrovascular accidents in the mother. The need for pharmacological therapy of mild to moderate hypertension is still debated, since no formal studies are available to clarify whether pharmacological treatment in such instances effectively reduces maternal or fetal risk. For the treatment of preeclampsia, hydralazine and nifedipine may be used when delivery is not applicable. Labetalol and diazoxide are effective for hypertensive emergencies. Life-threatening hypertension that does not respond to more conventional therapy is an indication for the use of sodium nitroprusside. For chronic hypertension, alpha-methyldopa remains the treatment of choice; if ineffective, hydralazine or beta-blockers are suitable. Effectiveness and safety of other molecules remain elusive. \nDesmoplastic small cell tumors of the peritoneum coexpressing mesenchymal and epithelial markers. Desmoplastic small cell tumors arising diffusely within the abdomen and lacking an apparent organ of origin are rare. Most previously reported cases occurred in children, but young adult patients also have been described. Light microscopic examination shows the tumors to be composed of nests of small cells surrounded by an abundant desmoplastic stroma. Immunohistochemical findings reveal multidirectional differentiation with coexpression of cytokeratin, milk fat globule, neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7, desmin, and vimentin. Electron microscopic examination demonstrates paranuclear condensations of intermediate filaments. The authors describe two patients who died of their disease, despite aggressive chemotherapy and surgical intervention. \nEthnic differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales. OBJECTIVE--To examine mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales by country of birth of the deceased. DESIGN--Standardised mortality ratios were computed by country of birth groups for ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease for 1979-83 and 1970-2 by using the five year age-sex specific rates for England and Wales for 1979-83 as standard. SETTING--England and Wales 1970-2 and 1979-83. RESULTS--In 1979-83 mortality from ischaemic heart disease was highest in men and women born in the Indian subcontinent (standardised mortality ratio 136 and 146 respectively). Young Indian men suffered the greatest excess (313 at ages 20-29). Other groups with raised mortality included Irish, Scottish, and Polish born immigrants. Those born in the Caribbean, the old Commonwealth, west Europe, and the United States had low death rates. In England and Wales mortality from ischaemic heart disease declined by 5% in men and 1% in women between 1970-2 and 1979-83, with greatest percentage declines in immigrants born in the United States, South Africa, the old Commonwealth, the Caribbean, and France. immigrant groups with raised mortality in the earlier period showed little improvement, and mortality from ischaemic heart disease increased among Indians (6% in men and 13% in women). In 1979-83 mortality from cerebrovascular disease was highest in Caribbeans (standardised mortality ratios 176 in men and 210 in women), followed by Africans, Indians, and Irish. Rates were low in west Europeans. Mortality from stroke declined by 28% overall in this period, a rate of decline shared by most groups. Men from the Indian subcontinent showed a decline of only 3%. CONCLUSION--In the 1980s mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease differed significantly between ethnic groups in England and Wales. In general, ethnic groups that experienced lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease in the 1970s showed the greatest improvement over the following decade. \nBotulinum toxin treatment of tremors. We report the results of an open trial of botulinum toxin (Botox) in the treatment of 51 patients with disabling tremors, classified as dystonic (14), essential (12), combination of dystonic and essential (22), parkinsonian (1), peripherally induced (1), and midbrain (1). The average age of the patients was 55.8 years, and duration of symptoms was 13.9 years. During a total of 160 treatment visits, an average of 242 +/- 75 units of Botox was injected per visit in cervical muscles of 42 patients with head tremor and 95 +/- 38 in forearm muscles of 10 patients with hand tremor; one patient was injected in both. The average peak effect for all patients was rated as 3.0 (0 to 4 scale). Thirty-five (67%) patients improved (peak effect greater than or equal to 1). The average latency from injection to response was 6.8 days, and the average duration of maximum improvement was 10.5 weeks. Local complications, lasting an average of 20.6 days, were noted in 17 (40%) patients injected for head tremor, consisting chiefly of dysphagia in 12 (29%), transient neck weakness in four (10%), and local pain in two (5%). Six (60%) patients with hand tremor had transient focal weakness. EMG recordings showed decreased amplitude of EMG bursts after Botox treatment. The results of this pilot study indicate that Botox injections can be used to control tremor in patients in whom other forms of therapy have failed. \nChickenpox pneumonia, its complications and management. A report of three cases, including the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We report three cases of chickenpox pneumonia in adults, all of whom required intermittent positive pressure ventilation. One patient developed a variety of complications, and another, a pregnant woman, required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. \nA prospective evaluation of the effect of tumor cell DNA content on recurrence in colorectal cancer. Tumor cell DNA (ploidy) content was measured prospectively in samples from 320 patients resected for colorectal cancer with a minimum follow-up time of 2 years. All patients were followed and those with recurrence were investigated carefully. There was no correlation between tumors with an abnormal cellular DNA content (aneuploid or tetraploid) and patient age, sex, tumor site, pathologic stage, or histologic grade. In 236 patients who underwent potentially curative operations, 75 (32%) had local and/or distant recurrence. The recurrence rate was significantly higher (test statistic, 4.3; P = 0.04) for those patients with aneuploid tumors (52 of 142, 37%) compared with those with diploid tumors (23 of 94, 24%). The subgroups of patients where ploidy exerted an effect were in patients with Stage B tumors or mobile tumors and in patients over 65 years of age. Further analysis showed that there was a twofold increase in local recurrence and a threefold increase in distant recurrence in patients with aneuploid tumors, but no excess of patients who had both local and distant recurrence. Measurement of DNA ploidy can identify a group of patients undergoing curative surgery for colorectal cancer at high risk for recurrence. In combination with clinicopathologic factors, DNA ploidy may be useful in analyzing the results of trials and in planning adjuvant therapy. \nEmergency treatment of headache. Headache is a frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department. Once a diagnosis is established, and significant organic disease can be ruled out, relief of pain must be addressed. Referral for follow-up care and narcotic habituation is a recurrent problem for the emergency physician. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of headache, evaluation of the emergency room patient, and treatment of the patient with headache. \nGene deletions force nonsecretory alpha-chain disease plasma cells to produce membrane-form alpha-chain only. We studied a case of nonsecretory alpha-chain disease. The proliferating plasma cells contained a short transcript coding for a truncated membrane-form alpha 1-chain. The productive alpha-gene bore several noncontiguous deletions affecting the VHDJH and CH1 regions. Two deletions were accompanied with peculiar insertions containing duplications. The first insertion contained an acceptor splice site and was present in part in the mature transcript, thus coding for an abnormal aminoterminal peptide. Another deletion located 3' to CH3 eliminated the polyadenylation site of secreted-form alpha-mRNA. As a result, only membrane-form alpha mRNA was present in the tumoral plasma cells, thus explaining the nonsecretory phenotype of the disease. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences showed that the previously undescribed human alpha membrane region is encoded by a single exon, beginning with two alternate acceptor splice sites, and comprises either 65 or 71 amino acids. \nAnterior sternal retraction for reoperative median sternotomy. The incidence of reoperative median sternotomy for repeat cardiac surgery is increasing. Reoperative median sternotomy is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality than first-time cardiac surgery. A portion of this morbidity and mortality may be due to direct injury to the heart and great vessels in the process of reopening the sternum. We report a new technique utilizing anterior sternal retraction that allows division of adhesions between the undersurface of the sternum and the heart and great vessels under direct vision. This technique enables the surgeon to minimize the risk of serious injury to these underlying structures during reoperative cardiac surgery. \nPhysical overdistension converts ventricular cardiomyocytes to acquire endocrine property and regulate ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide production. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is present in adult atria but at very low concentrations in normal adult mammalian ventricles. In the atria, the production of ANP is regulated by physical distension of the atrial wall. The same phenomenon was investigated in the ventricles of rats and men. Cardiac tissues from human ventricular aneurysm (n = 5), spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 30), and rats that had overloaded left ventricles induced by surgery (n = 84) were studied with the methods of light microscopic immunocytochemistry, electron microscopic immunogold staining, and RNA-RNA tissue in situ hybridization. It was found that the levels of ANP gene expression, ANP immunoreactivity, and ANP-containing specific granules in the overburdened ventricles were elevated and their degrees of fluctuation were directly proportional to the force of physical distension applied to the ventricular cardiomyocytes. In rats, ANP mRNA and ANP immunoreactivity returned to the control level seven days after the ventricular overload was surgically released. The changes of ANP and its mRNA in the ventricles were related more closely to the changes of intraventricular pressure than to cardiocytic hypertrophy. In addition, ANP immunoreactivity was demonstrated in Purkinje cells and periarteriolar cardiomyocytes in the ventricles of normotensive rats. In conclusion, physical overstretch of the ventricle wall is likely to be the triggering factor affecting ventricular cardiomyocytes to acquire endocrine property, and also to regulate the production of ventricular ANP, thereby contributing to the control of the blood volume and the blood pressure. \nFunctional outcomes of children with sickle-cell disease affected by stroke. The nature and degree of functional recovery after stroke in children with sickle-cell disease (SCD) has not been extensively investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the functional status of 14 SCD children who had had strokes and to compare them with age-matched and gender-matched SCD children who had not had strokes. By doing so, we would be able to quantify the eventual physical and cognitive functional outcomes of survivors of stroke secondary to SCD and assess the impact of stroke on these patients. These children (five boys and nine girls) with SCD and stroke(s) were 11.6 +/- 4.3 years of age (range five to 18 years). They experienced one to three strokes at a mean age of 6.1 +/- 5.2 years (range one to 17 years). A series of tests were administered to these subjects to evaluate physical and psychosocial functions. These tests were performed at least one year after the latest stroke. This study showed that all of the SCD-stroke children were physically independent. Only a few had impairments of hand functions and mild difficulties in self-care activities. However, most of these children demonstrated intellectual deficits ranging from borderline to moderate mental retardation, reduced language functions ranging from low normal to retarded range, and problems in adjustment. Intelligence quotient of the children with SCD-stroke(s) was significantly lower than those of age-matched and gender-matched nonstroke SCD children, suggesting that stroke caused an adverse effect on the cognitive functioning of these children. The results indicate that in the SCD-stroke children psychosocial deficits outweighed physical disabilities. \nAcute appendicitis. A 5-year review. A startling 31 per cent rate of perforated appendicitis in 1984 prompted a 5-year review at the Guthrie Medical Center. An increase over previous rates of 13 per cent and 0 per cent in 1964 and 1944 was confirmed in this study. Perforation accompanied 44 of 240 cases of appendicitis (18.3%); diagnostic accuracy in 295 cases undergoing operation was 81.4 per cent. Groups at risk for perforation were patients in the first decade of life (34.3% with perforations) and those over 50 years of age (48% perforated). Perforation rates were generally inversely related to accuracy. Accuracy was poorest in women in the second to fourth decade or those in the mid-portion of the menstrual cycle. When the appendix was not perforated, complications occurred in 8.7 per cent of patients while 29.5 per cent with a perforation had a complication. The mean hospital stay was prolonged by 2.5 days if the appendix was perforated. An increased awareness of the risk by both the public and physicians is essential to reduce the number of perforations. \nIntrarenal pressure following pyeloplasty or percutaneous surgery. In a study of 37 patients it was shown that recording the intrapelvic pressure is a safe and reliable means of judging the best time to remove a nephrostomy tube. No post-operative complications were encountered and the procedure has the added advantage of avoiding the use of X-rays. \nOncocytic metaplasia of the pharynx. Oncocytic metaplasia of the pharynx has been infrequently described, with only two previous cases in the literature. With the advent of panendoscopy during the last decade, however, a better understanding of this histopathologic diagnosis is desirable. Thirty-three cases are reviewed, with thirty occurring in the nasopharynx. This was most commonly discovered as an unrelated finding during endoscopic evaluation of a head and neck mass or malignancy in twenty-two patients, either histologically after random biopsy or after biopsy of small but visible lesions. An additional eight cases manifested otitis media or eustachian tube dysfunction. The histology, terminology, and benign clinical nature of these lesions are discussed. \nPituitary hyperplasia and gigantism in mice caused by a cholera toxin transgene. Cyclic AMP is thought to act as an intracellular second messenger, mediating the physiological response of many cell types to extracellular signals. In the pituitary, growth hormone (GH)-producing cells (somatotrophs) proliferate and produce GH in response to hypothalamic GH-releasing factor, which binds a receptor that stimulates Gs protein activation of adenylyl cyclase. We have now determined whether somatotroph proliferation and GH production are stimulated by cAMP alone, or require concurrent, non-Gs-mediated induction of other regulatory molecules by designing a transgene to induce chronic supraphysiological concentrations of cAMP in somatotrophs. The rat GH promoter was used to express an intracellular form of cholera toxin, a non-cytotoxic and irreversible activator of Gs. Introduction of this transgene into mice caused gigantism, elevated serum GH levels, somatotroph proliferation and pituitary hyperplasia. These results support the direct triggering of these events by cAMP, and illustrate the utility of cholera toxin transgenes as a tool for physiological engineering. \nBalloon dilatation of the aortic valve in the fetus: a report of two cases. Because they had irreversible damage to the left ventricular myocardium none of 12 patients with critical aortic stenosis diagnosed prenatally survived after postnatal treatment. This experience prompted three attempts at intrauterine balloon dilatation of the aortic valve in two fetuses with this condition. On each attempt the balloon catheter was successfully delivered to the left ventricle. In the first fetus the aortic valve was not crossed and the fetus died the next day. In the second fetus the balloon was correctly positioned across the aortic valve and inflated in the valve ring. After delivery, a further balloon angioplasty was performed; this relieved the stenosis but the patient died five weeks later from persisting left ventricular dysfunction related to endocardial fibroelastosis. Balloon angioplasty is feasible in fetal life but the prognosis depends on the ability of the relief of stenosis to limit, prevent, or allow regression of left ventricular damage before delivery. \nNew method for dealing with late-presenting spontaneous esophageal ruptures. A new technique is described for dealing with late-presenting spontaneous esophageal ruptures. This method requires only a short period of general anesthesia to drain the periesophageal abscess by a drainage tube inserted into the abscess cavity from the esophagus with the aid of a gastroscope and fluoroscopy. Gastric fluids are diverted from the esophageal rupture with a gastrostomy, and a jejunostomy is used for enteral feeding. The esophagus is retained, and closure of the fistula with resumption of normal swallowing is documented with serial sinograms. \nAlfentanil for urgent caesarean section in a patient with severe mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension. We present the case of a parturient with severe mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension who received general anaesthesia using alfentanil for urgent Caesarean section. Alfentanil promoted haemodynamic stability and allowed immediate postoperative extubation. Epidural morphine provided postoperative analgesia. This combination permitted early ambulation and prevention of thromboembolism. A disadvantage of this technique, neonatal respiratory depression, was promptly reversed with a single dose of naloxone. The anaesthetic management of mitral stenosis in pregnancy is discussed and the neonatal pharmacokinetics of maternally administered alfentanil are presented. \nHomozygosity for a newly identified missense mutation in a patient with very severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID). We have identified a previously unrecognized missense mutation in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID). The mutation is a G646-to-A transition at a CG dinucleotide and predicts a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 216. Computer analysis of secondary structure predicts a major alteration with loss of a beta-pleated sheet in a highly conserved region of the protein. The basepair substitution also generates a new site for the restriction enzyme BstXI in exon 7 of the genomic DNA. Digestion of genomic DNA from the patient and from his parents revealed that he was homozygous for the mutation and that his mother and father were carriers. This mutation in homozygous form appears to be associated with very severe disease, since the patient had perinatal onset of clinical manifestations of SCID, the highest concentration of the toxic metabolite deoxyATP in nine patients studied, and a relatively poor immunologic response during the initial 2 years of therapy with polyethylene glycol-adenosine deaminase. Analysis of DNA from 21 additional patients with ADA-SCID and from 19 unrelated normals revealed that, while none of the normal individuals showed the abnormal restriction fragment, two of the 21 patients studied were heterozygous for the G646-to-A mutation. \nSpontaneous abdominal arteriovenous fistulae: report of eight cases and review of the literature. The spontaneous rupture of an abdominal aneurysm into an adjacent major vein results in a profound and rapidly worsening haemodynamic disturbance. Survival depends on prompt diagnosis and closure of the fistula at operation. Eight cases are reported and modes of presentation, diagnostic criteria and management principles are reviewed in a detailed analysis of 148 cases in the English literature. \nHypoxaemia after nebulised salbutamol in wheezy infants: the importance of aerosol acidity. The effect of nebulised iso-osmolar, preservative free, but acidic salbutamol solution was studied in 34 acutely wheezing infants aged 1-17 months. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) and oxygen saturation (SO2) fell significantly during the first five minutes after nebulisation with further deterioration at 15-20 minutes. Ten of these infants were followed up for another two hours and showed slight improvement. Even after the second hour TcPO2 had not reached baseline values. Three months later the response to salbutamol and a placebo of equal acidity (pH 3.9) was studied in 11 infants from the same group, now free of symptoms. Lung function tests were included and showed no significant changes in specific conductance and volume corrected maximum expiratory flows (Vmax at functional residual capacity/thoracic gas volume). However, hypoxaemia occurred after the acidic placebo with a significant drop of TcPO2 (mean 0.9 kPa); SO2 decreased similarly but this did not reach significance. After salbutamol there was a further significant deterioration of mean TcPO2 (1.4 kPa) and of SO2. These results show that beside a possible pharmacological effect of salbutamol the acidity of the aerosol also induces hypoxaemia in infants. \nNoninvasive quantification of regional myocardial blood flow in coronary artery disease with oxygen-15-labeled carbon dioxide inhalation and positron emission tomography. BACKGROUND. Oxygen-15-labeled water is a diffusible, metabolically inert myocardial blood flow tracer with a short half-life (2 minutes) that can be used quantitatively with positron emission tomography (PET). The purpose of this study was to validate a new technique to quantify myocardial blood flow (MBF) in animals and to assess its application in patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. The technique involves the administration of 15O-labeled carbon dioxide (C15O2) and rapid dynamic scanning. Arterial and myocardial time activity curves were fitted to a single tissue compartment tracer kinetic model to estimate MBF in each myocardial region. Validation studies consisted of 52 simultaneous measurements of MBF with PET and gamma-labeled microspheres in nine closed-chest dogs over a flow range of 0.5-6.1 ml/g/min. A good correlation between the two methods was obtained (y = 0.36 + 1.0x, r = 0.91). Human studies consisted of 11 normal volunteers and eight patients with chronic stable angina and single-vessel disease, before and after intravenous dipyridamole infusion. In the normal group, MBF was homogeneous throughout the left ventricle both at rest and after administration of dipyridamole (0.88 +/- 0.08 ml/g/min and 3.52 +/- 1.12 ml/g/min, respectively; p less than or equal to 0.001). In patients, resting MBF was similar in the distribution of the normal and stenotic arteries (1.03 +/- 0.23 and 0.93 +/- 0.21 ml/g/min, respectively). After dipyridamole infusion, MBF in normally perfused areas increased to 2.86 +/- 0.83 ml/g/min, whereas in the regions supplied by stenotic arteries it increased to only 1.32 +/- 0.27 ml/g/min (p less than or equal to 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. PET with C15O2 inhalation provides an accurate noninvasive quantitative method for measuring regional myocardial blood flow in patients. \nSteps towards cost-benefit analysis of regional neurosurgical care OBJECTIVE--To determine the cost of averting death or severe disability by neurosurgical intervention. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of one year's admissions for neurosurgery; comparison of outcome with expected outcome in the absence of neurosurgical intervention and with the cost of neurosurgery. SETTING--Wessex Neurological Centre. PATIENTS--1026 Patients were admitted to the neurosurgical service in 1984. Of 1185 admissions, 978 case records were available and outcome was known in 919. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow outcome scale, modified as necessary, from the case notes, or by letter follow up to the general practitioner. Expected outcomes for each of the 54 diagnoses were derived from both published reports where available and an expert panel of 18 consultant neurosurgeons. The cost of the neurosurgical service for 1983-4 was known from a separate study and the cost per patient was calculated using the length of stay. RESULTS--The cost of neurosurgery in 1983-4 was 1.8 million pounds. In all, 243 deaths or severe disabilities were estimated to have been averted at an average cost of 7325 pounds (range 5000 pounds to 70,000 pounds). The overall cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was 350 pounds (range 34 pounds to greater than 400,000 pounds). The cost of long term care for severely disabled survivors is at least 18-fold greater than the cost of neurosurgical intervention to avert such disability. CONCLUSIONS--In Britain neurosurgery is not expensive in comparison with the costs and benefits of other areas of medicine, and the cost per QALY is unexpectedly low except for severe diffuse head injury, malignant brain tumors, and cerebral metastases. The neurosurgical budget should be assessed in the context of managing a patient in hospital and subsequently in the community. \nUncompacted inner myelin lamellae in inherited tendency to pressure palsy. Nerves in patients with inherited tendency to pressure palsy (ITPP) are susceptible to degrees of traction or compression which in nonaffected persons do not induce neuropathic symptoms or deficits, conduction block of fibers, or electromyographic changes characteristic of the disorder. Two observations suggest a widespread asymptomatic abnormality of nerves: 1) low conduction velocity of clinically unaffected nerves, and 2) focal thickenings (tomacula) on teased myelinated fibers of clinically unaffected sural nerves. Sural nerves from five patients and five healthy subjects were assessed for morphologic abnormality in ITPP that might account for the susceptibility of nerves to compression. Teased nerve fibers showed a higher frequency of segmental demyelination or remyelination, or both (p less than 0.003). The mean frequency of fibers showing focal myelin thickenings was 57 +/- 10% in ITPP and 0% in controls. In electron micrographs, regions of uncompacted myelin lamellae, usually affecting the innermost lamellae and extending for a variable distance averaging 9 +/- 4 microns were seen in 11 +/- 4% of fibers in ITPP. None were found in the control nerves. The finding of uncompacted myelin lamellae may suggest an abnormality of myelin composition or of interaction of Schwann cells and axons accounting for the increased susceptibility to pressure palsy, tomaculous formation, or demyelination. From electron microscopic evaluation of serial skip sections we infer that myelin of tomaculae is in continuity with internodal myelin and is reduplicated (full-thickness or cleaved layers are longitudinally or circumferentially folded-back on themselves). \nMolecular characterization of the mouse mannose-binding proteins. The mannose-binding protein A but not C is an acute phase reactant. Mannose-binding proteins play a role in first line host defense against a variety of pathogens. We report the molecular cloning of two mouse mannose-binding proteins designated A and C based on their close identity with their rat homologues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse mannose-binding proteins, as with rat and the human forms, have an NH2 terminus that is rich in cysteine that stabilizes a collagen alpha helix followed by a carboxyl- terminal carbohydrate binding domain. We further show that the mouse mannose-binding protein A mRNA, as with the human, is induced like the acute phase reactant serum amyloid P protein, yet the expression of mouse mannose-binding protein C mRNA is not regulated above its low baseline level. The expression of both mannose-binding proteins A and C mRNA is restricted to the liver under basal and stress conditions. \nChagas' cardioneuropathy: effect of ganglioside treatment in chronic dysautonomic patients--a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. To date, there is no effective pharmacologic treatment for Chagas' cardioneuropathy, one of the most common causes of congestive heart failure and sudden death in the world. Fifty-eight adults with positive serology for Chagas' disease and abnormal autonomic nervous system tests participated in this placebo-controlled clinical trial with Cronassial (mixed gangliosides), 40 mg daily intramuscular injection for 4 or 8 weeks. We measured postural response (heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure changes in response to standing); heart rate changes induced by cough and hyperventilation reflex tests; dizziness on standing; number of stress-induced arrhythmias; and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive T-lymphocyte percentage in blood samples. Cronassial is safe and significantly improves systolic blood pressure (p = 0.050) and double product responses to postural stress (p = 0.028), hyperventilation heart rate response (p = 0.007), frequency of dizziness episodes (p less than 0.001), number of arrhythmias (p = 0.033), and percentage of PAS-positive T-lymphocyte counts (p less than 0.001) compared with placebo. \nBiliary patency imaging after endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy with gallbladder in situ. Clinical impact of nonvisualization. We prospectively performed nuclear biliary patency imaging (HIDA scanning) in 62 patients who had undergone endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy for management of pancreaticobiliary disease with their gallbladders in situ. Elective cholecystectomy was not recommended because of advanced age, comorbidity, or absence of gallstones. All patients had patent cystic ducts at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography balloon cholangiography. Eighteen (29.1%) of 62 patients had nonvisualizing HIDA scans, and in 44 (70.9%) of 62 visualization was normal or delayed. Six cholecystectomies were required for colic (n = 1), acute cholecystitis (n = 4), and acute cholecystocholedochal fistula with cholangitis (n = 1). Among the patients with cholelithiasis and nonvisualization (n = 13), five (38.5%) required surgery, whereas only one (4.8%) of 21 patients with cholelithiasis and visualization required surgery. Nonvisualizing HIDA scans are frequent (30%) after endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy and have no clinical relevance in patients without cholelithiasis but predict the need for cholecystectomy within 16 months in 38.5% of patients with cholelithiasis. \nAnterograde amnesia with fornix damage following removal of IIIrd ventricle colloid cyst. Two patients developed anterograde amnesia following the apparently uncomplicated transcallosal-transventricular removal of a colloid cyst. Damage to the fornical columns was demonstrated on CT and MRI scans, whilst other memory related structures were entirely normal. Longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation, over 12-24 months, has revealed a very similar pattern of deficit in the two cases: verbal memory has remained persistently impaired whilst nonverbal anterograde memory has improved to some degree. Formal tests of remote public (famous faces and events) and personal autobiographical memory have supported the clinical impression that neither patient has a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. These findings address the role of the fornix, and the dissociation of memory processes in humans. \nHigh-dose melphalan with 6-hydroxydopamine-purged autologous bone marrow transplantation for poor-risk neuroblastoma. Long-term results are presented of 28 patients who were diagnosed with neuroblastoma at more than 12 months of age and who received melphalan 180 mg/m2 (n = 6) or 240 mg/m2 (n = 22) to consolidate remissions of Stage IV disease or to control refractory disease. Twenty-four patients also received dianhydrogalactitol 180 to 240 mg/m2, and 11 received total body irradiation 450 to 600 cGy. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) was performed with marrow that was unpurged (n = 2) or purged ex vivo (n = 26) with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) 20 micrograms/ml plus ascorbate 200 micrograms/ml. The median time to an absolute neutrophil count of 500/microliters was 21 days and to self-sustaining platelet counts more than 20,000/microliters, 28 days. One patient required infusion of unpurged reserve marrow. Two groups of patients underwent ABMT: (1) 17 patients (Group I) who were in first remission a median of 7 months after diagnosis; and (2) 11 patients (Group II) who had refractory disease or were in second remission. For Group I, event-free survival was 29% at 12 months and 6% at 24 months post-ABMT. All Group II patients died of disease or ABMT-related toxicity. Overall, of the 28 patients, one is a long-term relapse-free survivor; five died of ABMT-related toxicity; ten patients with tumors present at ABMT had progressive disease within 6 months of ABMT; and 12 patients with no measurable disease at ABMT relapsed 4 to 32 months (median, 12) post-ABMT. Among the latter, six relapses involved the primary site, and six were restricted to distant sites. These results--in accord with the long-term outcome in other series--suggest that for neuroblastoma high-dose melphalan cannot be relied on to ablate residual disease or to salvage patients with refractory tumors. In addition, the pattern of relapse in several patients could be explained by infusion of incompletely purged autografts; this would support recent laboratory evidence that 6-OHDA/ascorbate is a suboptimal purging method. \nMalignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites: transjugular insertion of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis. Although the transjugular approach has long been used to provide safe access to the liver, it has not been used for placement of stents in biliary obstruction. The recent development of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis now makes this method more feasible. The case of a patient with malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites is presented herein. Palliation was achieved with an expandable biliary endoprosthesis placed by the transjugular-hepatic vein approach. \nTime spent caregiving and help received by spouses and adult children of brain-impaired adults. Caregivers for brain-impaired adults differ in living arrangements, amount of time spent giving care, and assistance received from family and friends and from paid help depending on their kin relationship and employment status. Spousal caregivers devote large amounts of time to caregiving, and husbands spend no less time than wives. Most caregivers receive little assistance from other family members and friends, but husbands receive more than others. Employed spouses receive more paid help than those without jobs, but employment does not affect the amount of paid help received by adult daughters. \nEpilepsy and brain tumors: implications for treatment. Primary intraparenchymal tumors of the brain are important etiologic factors in partial or focal epilepsy. Indolent low-grade gliomas may be associated with a long-standing seizure disorder refractory to medical treatment. Surgical resection of the neoplasm and the epileptogenic area may render patients seizure-free. Removal of the tumor alone may also be associated with an excellent survival rate and surgical outcome. Conventional neurosurgical procedures are restricted in patients with tumors that are deep-seated lesions or involve functional cerebral cortex. Computer-assisted stereotactic surgical procedures have been developed for biopsy and resection of intra-axial brain-mass lesions. Stereotactic tumor resection may allow pathological determination of intracranial lesions and produce a worthwhile reduction in seizure activity in some patients with intractable partial epilepsy. \nLabyrinthitis ossificans: histopathologic consideration for cochlear implantation. Labyrinthitis ossificans may be a hindrance to cochlear implantation by making electrode insertion difficult. We performed a histopathologic study of 24 temporal bones with labyrinthitis ossificans from multiple causes. The organ of Corti was graphically reconstructed and the degree of obstruction was estimated for each millimeter of the cochlea. Correlations were calculated between the degree of new bone formation and the cause, patient's age and sex, and time from the original temporal bone insult. Our results demonstrate that complete cochlear ossification is rare. The scala tympani in the basal turn of the cochlea is the most frequent area of ossification, regardless of the cause of the labyrinthitis ossificans. Meningogenic labyrinthitis, usually a childhood disease, was associated with the greatest amount of ossification. When ossification resulted from tympanogenic labyrinthitis, the scala tympani was completely ossified near the round window niche in all temporal bones. Neo-ossification of the basal turn associated with otosclerosis was limited to the proximal 6 mm of the scala tympani in all cases. Three temporal bones had a patent round window niche and basal turn, but significant apical and middle-turn ossification. Peripheral sensorineural elements were severely degenerated in the region of the ossification in all specimens, and spiral ganglion cell counts were decreased. \nFume fever and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome in a welder. I have reported a case of fume fever and concurrent reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) after welding. The RADS should be added to the list of potential hazards associated with welding. \nCarcinoma (malignant mixed mullerian [mesodermal] tumor) of the uterus and ovary. Correlation of clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical features in 29 cases. We examined the histologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical features of a series of 23 endometrial, five cervical, and one ovarian carcinosarcomas (malignant mixed mullerian [mesodermal] tumors) and nine associated distant peritoneal metastases. The primary tumors all showed epithelial differentiation (cytokeratin and/or epithelial membrane antigen expression) of the carcinomatous component, while sarcomatous areas showed epithelial differentiation in all but one case. The metastases showed uniform staining for cytokeratin (eight of eight cases) and epithelial membrane antigen (eight of eight cases), including the spindle cell component that was present in four of nine cases. Desmin significantly changed the interpretation of rhabdomyosarcoma differentiation by refuting putative rhabdomyoblasts in two cases and identifying rhabdomyoblasts in two other cases where they were unrecognized on hematoxylineosin staining. S100 protein was positive in all five cases with chondrosarcoma differentiation. Muscle-specific actin and vimentin were positive in the sarcomatous component of all cases and in the carcinomatous component of seven and 10 cases, respectively. After immunostaining, heterologous elements were present in 18 of 29 cases (11 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, three cases of chondrosarcoma, three cases of mixed rhabdomyosarcoma and chondrosarcoma, and one case of liposarcoma). Only six of 27 patients with follow-up were disease free for 12 months or longer (associated with stage I or II disease, smaller size, no lymphatic invasion in the resection specimen, and no invasion of the outer two thirds of myometrium). Presence and type of heterologous elements, grade of sarcomatous or carcinomatous components, histologic type of carcinomatous component, gross appearance, presence of necrosis, or use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy did not affect outcome. Carcinosarcomas are clinically aggressive distinctive mixed epithelial-stromal neoplasms with histologic and immunohistochemical features that overlap with metaplastic carcinoma in many cases. \nCytokines and the pathogenesis of neuroborreliosis: Borrelia burgdorferi induces glioma cells to secrete interleukin-6. Lyme disease is a multisystemic disease caused by a tickborne spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. Neuroborreliosis is characterized by intrathecal production of antibodies specific for the spirochete. This suggests that spirochetal infection of the central nervous system produces conditions that support the maturation of B lymphocytes to immunoglobulin-secreting cells. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) stimulates B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells. The present study was undertaken to determine whether B. burgdorferi can stimulate cells of central nervous system origin to secrete IL-6. C6 rat glioma cells cultured with spirochetes induced secretion of IL-6 activity. Peak stimulation was achieved at 24 h with 25 spirochetes per glioma cell. Glioma cells were also stimulated to produce IL-6 by interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor. That very few spirochetes are found in Lyme disease patients suggests that biologic amplification factors derived from the organism or the host, or both, are responsible for the pathogenesis of this disease. IL-6 can now be added to the growing list of such factors. \nCataract extraction after brachytherapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid. Thirteen eyes of 55 consecutive patients treated with brachytherapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid developed postirradiation cataracts. Cataract development was more common in older patients and in patients with larger and more anterior tumors. Eleven eyes had extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Initial visual improvement occurred in 91% of eyes, with an average improvement of 5.5 lines. Visual acuity was maintained at 20/60 or better in 55% of the eyes over an average period of follow-up of 24 months (range, 6 to 40 months). These data suggest that, visually, cataract extraction can be helpful in selected patients who develop a cataract after brachytherapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid. \nFamilial aneurysms of the interventricular septum. Congenital aneurysms of the interventricular septum were found in a 29 year old man and his four year old son. Both were symptom free. In both, M mode and cross sectional echocardiography showed an aneurysm in the mid-muscular trabecular portion of the ventricular septum with considerable paradoxical motion of the aneurysmal segment. Otherwise the chamber dimensions, intracardiac structures, and cardiac function were normal for age. Congenital aneurysm of the interventricular septum is rare and these familial cases may be unique. \nClinical significance of aortic graft dilation. To determine if there is a relationship between aortic graft dilation and graft complications, 443 serial ultrasound studies performed on 106 patients were analyzed. Of 443 studies, 243 were done retrospectively on 59 patients from 3 to 144 months (mean, 38 months) after graft implantation. Forty-seven additional patients were studied prospectively, with direct measurement of external graft diameter after aortic clamp release. Subsequent ultrasound examinations at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and then annually (n = 200) were routinely performed. Mean follow-up was 12 months (range, 3 to 48). Knitted double velour Dacron prostheses were used in all cases reported in this study. This cohort was culled from our ongoing graft surveillance program, which includes grafts of other materials and manufacturers. Comparison of the manufacturer's recorded box size with follow-up ultrasound measurements in all cases demonstrated a mean increase in graft diameter of 3.7 mm (23%). Little dilation occurred after 1 year. In 47 patients with direct graft diameter measurements taken after declamping, an immediate mean increase of 1.7 mm (11%) was noted. Dilation was not related to surgical indication (aneurysm vs occlusive disease) or hypertension. Analysis of the 10% segment of the series with the greatest dilation (mean, 39%) did not demonstrate a predilection for graft complications. No significant dilation was noted in the single cases encountered of femoral and iliac anastomotic aneurysms and perigraft seroma. Although dilation of knitted Dacron grafts is to be anticipated, no association between graft dilation and graft complications was found in this series. \nElectrophysiologic analysis of early Parkinson's disease. We have been interested in the application of quantitative measures of motor performance as a possible means of early detection of Parkinson's disease. To assess motor function, we have measured movement time (the physiologic correlate of bradykinesia) and reaction time (simple and directional choice) with an upper limb motor task, and tremor with accelerometry and electromyographic recordings. In this report we describe preliminary data from a Parkinson's disease patient group with symptoms of fewer than 2 years' average duration (compared with an age- and gender-matched normal control group) which indicate that precise, quantitative tests of motor function can detect the slight deviations from normal tha",
