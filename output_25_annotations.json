        "text": " order to establish the potential benefit of thrombolytic therapy. A preliminary study was conducted in patients admitted in our coronary care unit for unstable angina with typical clinical and electrocardiographic criteria and with early coronary angiogram. After exclusion of 4 patients with left main coronary stenosis or contraindications for thrombolysis, 16 patients received thrombolytic infusion and 14 underwent a second coronary angiogram. Seven patients had an intracoronary thrombus (6 nonocclusive, 1 occlusive) and at the second angiogram only 3 nonocclusive thrombi were modified (1 disappeared, 2 were reduced). Moreover, the quantitative Coronary Angiography Analysis System (CAAS) in the 11 cases suitable for analysis did not show any significant changes, especially in the Ambrose type IIB lesions. In-hospital clinical outcome was not influenced by thrombolytic therapy (5 ischemic recurrences, 1 fatal myocardial infarction, 4 emergency and 4 elective revascularization procedures). This short series is in agreement with the literature data. Only one third of patients with active unstable angina remains refractory to conventional therapy. The transient benefit of thrombolysis is limited to patients with demonstrated intracoronary thrombi. Clinical or angiographic improvement are not always in correlation and until now do not seem able to prevent short-term recurrences or the need for revascularization procedures. \nHypertension in obesity and NIDDM. Role of insulin and sympathetic nervous system. An important link exists between obesity, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and hypertension. Most patients with NIDDM are obese; the incidence of hypertension in obesity and NIDDM is substantial, approaching 50% in some studies. Furthermore, hypertension is known to contribute to the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with obesity and NIDDM. Despite the obvious clinical importance, the pathogenesis of hypertension in obesity and NIDDM remains poorly understood. Recent studies have identified hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance as important threads that tie hypertension, obesity, and NIDDM together. The hypothesis is developed that insulin-mediated sympathetic stimulation contributes to blood pressure elevation in both obesity and NIDDM. Recruited as a mechanism to limit weight gain and restore energy balance, insulin resistance and sympathetic stimulation increase blood pressure by enhancing renal Na+ reabsorption and stimulating the cardiovascular system. In this article, we review the evidence on which this hypothesis is based. \nIntracranial arteriovenous fistula manifesting as progressive neurological deterioration in an infant: case report. This 1-year-old male infant had been diagnosed with cerebral degenerative disease because he developed psychomotor regression, and brain atrophy was demonstrated on computed tomography. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which suggested a cerebrovascular malformation. Cerebral angiography disclosed an arteriovenous fistula, fed by an anterior cerebral artery and directly draining into a cortical vein. The occlusion of the feeding artery was followed by a satisfactory recovery. The mechanism of the neurological symptoms in this patient is thought to be caused by a steal phenomenon and compression of the brain stem by venous engorgement in the posterior fossa. \nLow power laser biostimulation of chronic oro-facial pain. A double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study in 40 patients. The efficacy of low power laser stimulation in the treatment of chronic oro-facial pain conditions was investigated in a double-blind placebo controlled modified cross-over study in 40 patients. The laser was an invisible infrared (IR) diode laser with an emission at 904 nanometer (nm). Treatment effect was evaluated by means of VAS-scales and global assessment of pain. Outcome of treatment was correlated to changes in urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). The clinical impression was that placebo was superior to laser stimulation. No statistically significant difference between the analgesic effect of the laser and placebo irradiation was found on VAS-scales. A significant (P = 0.05) increase in 5-HIAA excretion was found in the placebo group. It is concluded that the possibility of a substantial placebo response should be taken into consideration using 904 nm (IR) lasers for pain treatment in patients with this type of chronic oro-facial pain. \nColonic epithelial dysplasia or carcinoma in a regional group of patients with ulcerative colitis of more than 15 years duration. Colonoscopic screening for neoplasia was performed in a regional group of ulcerative colitis patients with a disease duration of greater than or equal to 15 years. A total of 121 patients, aged less than 80 years, were invited to participate, of whom 100 (83%) accepted colonoscopy, including biopsies in 15 standard locations of the entire colon, plus additional biopsies from all visible lesions. Unequivocal dysplasia was found in one patient with extensive colitis and a disease duration of 31 years. A polyp with highly differentiated adenocarcinoma was found in the sigmoid colon of a patient with intermittent rectum involvement, 37 years after the ulcerative colitis diagnosis had been made. Biopsy specimens from the remaining 98 patients showed no signs of dysplasia or cancer. Thus the frequency of pre-malignant or malignant changes is very low compared with the results of similar studies, and the rationale for general colonoscopic surveillance programmes for such patients is open to question. \nImportant melanocytic lesions in childhood and adolescence. Melanocytic nevi are common in children and adolescents, and the preponderance of these lesions are benign. Congenital melanocytic nevi, dysplastic nevi, and large numbers of common acquired nevi, however, may indicate an increased risk of malignant melanoma. With the exception, possibly, of giant congenital nevi, melanoma associated with these lesions generally occurs in adulthood. Nonetheless, some patients can be identified as being at increased risk for the development of melanoma during childhood. The poor prognosis associated with advanced melanoma and the curability of early lesions underscore the importance of prompt recognition of melanoma when it does occur in children. Furthermore, physicians who care for children are in a key position to decrease risk of melanoma throughout the lifespan by encouraging avoidance of excessive sun exposure during childhood. \nSubcutaneous metoclopramide in the treatment of symptomatic gastroparesis: clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics. We investigated the safety and efficacy of short-term s.c. administration of metoclopramide in the treatment of symptomatic gastric stasis. Ten patients with gastroparesis, documented by abnormal solid phase radionuclide gastric emptying study, were treated with 10 mg (2 ml) of s.c. metoclopramide every 6 hr for 3 days. Patients gave themselves the injections as outpatients. Questionnaires were then completed concerning symptom relief, local side effects and adverse reactions. A repeat gastric emptying study was obtained immediately after the last dose of metoclopramide. Serum metoclopramide concentrations were obtained at trough, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hr postadministration and serum prolactin levels at trough, 1 and 3 hr. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed mean peak metoclopramide concentration at 30 min of 99.7 +/- 47.1 ng/ml with measured levels of 93.9 +/- 106.83 ng/ml at 60 min and return to trough values by 4 hr; trough prolactins remained elevated above normal values. Gastric stasis improved from a base-line retention of 78.7% of radioisotope at 2 hr to 72.5% after 3 days of therapy (P = .65). Eight patients reported significant improvement in symptomology and two patients reported lessening of symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, heartburn and vomiting. The side effects were minimal and did not interfere with completion of the protocol. We demonstrated that s.c. administration of metoclopramide was well accepted by patients and resulted in subjective and objective improvement of gastric stasis. In addition, serum metoclopramide concentrations were comparable with other parenteral routes of administration. Furthermore, serum prolactin levels may provide both a bioassay of efficacy and a marker for monitoring compliance. \nDifferential enhancement of interferon-gamma-induced MHC class II expression of HEp-2 cells by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induces the expression of MHC class II antigens on non-lymphoid cells. In this study we investigated the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the most active metabolite of vitamin D3, on the IFN-gamma-induced expression of MHC class II antigens on HEp-2 cells. We found that 1,25(OH)2D3 enhanced the IFN-gamma-induced expression of HLA-DR on these cells. Differential effects on the MHC class II antigens HLA-DR, -DQ and -DP were also observed. \nReoperations for late complications following abdominal aortic operation. Fifty patients were identified who, following abdominal aortic operation, developed late complications affecting the vascular graft or endarterectomy and who underwent their first reoperation between 1979 and 1989. Thrombosis was the commonest complication affecting 28 (56 per cent) patients, followed by false aneurysm in 11 (22 per cent), enteric fistula in nine (18 per cent) and graft infection in two (4 per cent). The 30-day mortality rate for reoperation was 8 per cent; longer follow-up revealed mortality rates of 22, 50 and 63 per cent at 1, 3 and 5 years respectively. Thirty-four complications required reoperation within 5 years of the original surgery. Reoperation was needed for 35 patients whose original pathology was occlusive disease and for 15 whose original pathology was aneurysm. The nature of the complication was related to initial pathology; thrombosis was far commoner in those with occlusive disease, and enteric fistula and false aneurysm were commoner in those with aneurysmal disease. \nSerial antiarrhythmic drug treatment to maintain sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion for chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. The sequential use of different types of antiarrhythmic drugs may improve arrhythmia prognosis in chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter after successful electrical cardioversion. The rationale for serial treatment is that the arrhythmogenic mechanism may vary between patients, leading to different responses to 1 specific drug. To investigate this issue prospectively, 127 patients having chronic fibrillation or flutter exclusively, underwent serial drug treatment with flecainide (stage I) followed by sotalol or, if contraindicated, quinidine (stage II) and eventually amiodarone (stage III). Stages II and III were entered after electrical recardioversion for a recurrence during stages I or II, respectively. Calculated on an actuarial basis, the 2-year cumulative percentage of patients free of the arrhythmia increased from 31% after stage I to 63% at the end of serial treatment. To reach this result, a mean of 1.8 +/- 0.8 cardioversions per patient were needed, with 53 patients progressing to stage II and 34 to stage III. Sixteen patients stopped serial treatment prematurely and 15 patients were considered to have intractable atrial fibrillation at the end of stage III. Incidence of proarrhythmia was low. Multivariate analysis disclosed that an older age, in combination with a large number of previous episodes of arrhythmia, a long previous duration of arrhythmia and presence of mitral valve disease, were predictive for medical refractoriness during serial treatment. It is concluded that serial treatment may improve arrhythmia prognosis in atrial fibrillation or flutter, with an acceptable incidence of proarrhythmic events. \nCorrelation between molecular and clinical events in the evolution of chronic myelocytic leukemia to blast crisis. A patient with typical Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) was studied during sequential phases of disease: (1) initial chronic phase; (2) myeloid blast crisis; (3) second chronic phase; and (4) accelerated disease. A point mutation in the coding sequence of the p53 gene first appeared concomitantly with the blast crisis and then disappeared with the re-establishment of a second chronic phase. The chromosomal concomitant of the molecular alteration was a deletion of 17p. These observations suggest that abnormalities of the p53 anti-oncogene are temporally related to the clinical progression of some cases of CML and are probably responsible for the development of blast crisis in these cases. \nCorrelation of radiologic assessment of lumbar spine fusions with surgical exploration. Although inspection of posterolateral lumbar fusion is the best method of determining its solidity, routine exploration of the fusion is somewhat impractical because of the morbidity and expense involved. Removal of internal fixation devices or implantable batteries or reoperation for failed back surgery enabled the exploration and assessment of lumbar spine fusions in 214 operations on 175 patients. The preoperative radiologic assessment (plain roentgenographs, polytomography, bending films, and computed tomographic scans) were correlated with surgical findings. This study indicated a significant percentage of inaccuracy of all radiologic modalities used. Noncorrelations were present in 36% of plain roentgenographs, 41% of polytomograms, 38% of bending films, and 43% of computed tomographic scans. Radiologic inaccuracy was manifest on both the positive and negative sides. Computed tomographic scanning presented the lowest percentage of inaccuracy (22%) and bending films the highest percentage (27%). Based on these findings, there exists the need for more accurate noninvasive methods to determine the solidity of spine fusions. \nCervicocranial arterial dissection. Dissection of the cervicocranial arteries is becoming more frequently recognized as a cause of neurological disorders. Typical clinical features seen with dissection include unilateral headache, oculosympathetic palsy, amaurosis fugax, and symptoms of focal brain ischemia. The diagnosis of carotid or intracranial dissection is usually best confirmed by angiography, although magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography have been shown to visualize intimal dissection. The prognosis in cases of spontaneous dissection is generally benign unless the initial manifestation involves infarction with substantial deficit. The best approach to treatment appears to be the administration of the anticoagulant, heparin, followed by warfarin or antiplatelet therapy. Surgical intervention is reserved for cases of progressive or recurrent ischemic complication that occurs despite the administration of adequate doses of anticoagulants. \nCholelithiasis after treatment for childhood cancer. The authors evaluated the risk of development of cholelithiasis in 6050 patients treated at a single hospital for various childhood cancers with different therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation, from 1963 to 1989. Patients with underlying chronic hemolytic anemia or preexisting gallstones were excluded. Nine female and seven male patients with a median age of 12.4 years (range, 1.2 to 22.8 years) at diagnosis of primary cancer had gallstones develop 3 months to 17.3 years (median, 3.1 years) after therapy was initiated. Cumulative risks of 0.42% at 10 years and 1.03% at 18 years after diagnosis substantially exceed those reported for the general population of this age group. Treatment-related factors significantly associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis were ileal conduit, parenteral nutrition, abdominal surgery, and abdominal radiation therapy (relative risks and 95% confidence intervals = 61.6 [27.9-135.9], 23.0 [9.8-54.1], 15.1 [7.1-32.2], and 7.4 [3.2-17.0], respectively). There was no correlation with the type of cancer, nor was the frequency of conventional predisposing features (e.g., family history, obesity, use of oral contraceptives, and pregnancy) any higher among the affected patients in this study than in the general population. Patients with cancer who have risk factors identified here should be monitored for the development of gallstones. \nComparison between anal endosonography and digital examination in the evaluation of anal fistulae. A prospective trial was performed comparing the accuracy of digital examination and anal endosonography in defining the anatomy of anal fistulae. Before operation 38 consecutive patients were assessed by the consultant in charge of the case, by a research fellow and by anal endosonography involving two radiologists. These findings were compared with the operative findings. Consultants correctly identified 26 of 33 internal openings, 29 of 34 primary tracks and 15 of 21 secondary tracks. The research fellow correctly identified 26 internal openings, 24 primary tracks and 10 secondary tracks. There was no significant difference between the accuracy of consultants and the research fellow. Anal endosonography identified 10 internal openings based on initial criteria. This rose to 24 when revised ultrasonographic criteria were applied. There was no statistical difference between consultant assessment and anal ultrasonography in correctly identifying intersphincteric and transphincteric tracks. Ultrasonography is unable to assess primary superficial, suprasphincteric and extrasphincteric tracks or secondary supralevator and infralevator tracks. Consultant assessment of secondary supralevator and infralevator tracks was correct in 78 per cent of cases. \nTowards a less costly but accurate test of gastric emptying and small bowel transit. Our aim is to develop a less costly but accurate test of stomach emptying and small bowel transit by utilizing selected scintigraphic observations 1-6 hr after ingestion of a radiolabeled solid meal. These selected data were compared with more detailed analyses that require multiple scans and labor-intensive technical support. A logistic discriminant analysis was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of selected summaries of scintigraphic transit measurements. We studied 14 patients with motility disorders (eight neuropathic and six myopathic, confirmed by standard gastrointestinal manometry) and 37 healthy subjects. The patient group had abnormal gastric emptying (GE) and small bowel transit time (SBTT). The proportion of radiolabel retained in the stomach from 2 to 4 hr (GE 2 hr, GE 3 hr, GE 4 hr), as well as the proportion filling the colon at 4 and 6 hr (CF 4 hr, CF 6 hr) were individually able to differentiate health from disease (P less than 0.05 for each). From the logistic discriminant model, an estimated sensitivity of 93% resulted in similar specificities for detailed and selected transit parameters for gastric emptying (range: 62-70%). Similarly, combining selected observations, such as GE 4 hr with CF 6 hr, had a specificity of 76%, which was similar to the specificity of combinations of more detailed analyses. Based on the present studies and future confirmation in a larger number of patients, including those with less severe motility disorders, the 2-, 4-, and 6-hr scans with quantitation of proportions of counts in stomach and colon should provide a useful, relatively inexpensive strategy to identify and monitor motility disorders in clinical and epidemiologic studies. \nMedulloblastoma: freedom from relapse longer than 8 years--a therapeutic cure? Seventy-seven patients presenting with medulloblastoma between 1958 and 1986 were treated at Stanford University Medical Center and studied retrospectively. Multimodality therapy utilized surgical extirpation followed by megavoltage irradiation. In 15 cases chemotherapy was used as adjunctive treatment. The 10- and 15-year actuarial survival rates were both 41% with an 18-year maximum follow-up period (median 4.75 years). There were no treatment failures after 8 years of tumor-free survival. Gross total removal of tumor was achieved in 22 patients (32%); the surgical mortality rate was 3.9%. No significant difference was noted in the incidence of metastatic disease between shunted and nonshunted patients. The classical form of medulloblastoma was present in 67% of cases while the desmoplastic subtype was found in 16%. Survival rates were best for patients presenting after 1970, for those with desmoplastic tumors, and for patients receiving high-dose irradiation (greater than or equal to 5000 cGy) to the posterior fossa. Although early data on freedom from relapse suggested a possible beneficial effect from chemotherapy, long-term follow-up results showed no advantage from this modality of treatment. The patterns of relapse and survival were examined; 64% of relapses occurred within the central nervous system, and Collins' rule was applicable in 83% of cases beyond the period of risk. Although patients treated for recurrent disease could be palliated, none were long-term survivors. The study data indicate that freedom from relapse beyond 8 years from diagnosis can be considered as a cure in this disease. Long-term follow-up monitoring is essential to determine efficacy of treatment and to assess survival patterns accurately. \nLocally advanced paranasal sinus and nasopharynx tumors treated with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant infusion cisplatin. Fourteen patients with paranasal sinus complex and nasopharynx tumors were treated at State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn (Brooklyn, NY) with a regimen of split-course hyperfractionated radiation (120 cGy/fraction) and concomitant cisplatin infusion (5 to 7 mg/m2/24 hours). All of the patients had T4 tumors or massively recurrent disease with base of skull or facial bone involvement. Twelve patients were treated with curative intent receiving total doses of 6000 to 6960 cGy (modal 6750 cGy), whereas two patients were treated with less than 5000 cGy as palliation. Eleven of the 12 patients (92%) achieved a complete response, and 7 of 12 (58%) are alive at 35 to 72 months (mean, 47 months). Five patients are alive with no evidence of disease, and two with a local recurrence. Three patients died of distant disease, and two died from a local recurrence. When the response to treatment was analyzed based on tumor volume and radiation dose, only two of nine lesions measuring between 4 to 10 cm failed locally. The two palliative patients had almost complete local clearance of the disease but died at 2 and 8 months, respectively. In nine patients, the eye or optic nerve was included in the treatment field and received between 2000 to 6960 cGy. Only one of these nine patients had ophthalmic complication and this was confined to the cornea. \nIloprost attenuates the increased permeability in skeletal muscle after ischemia and reperfusion. Increased vascular permeability is an early and sensitive indicator of ischemic muscle injury, occurring before significant histologic or radionuclide changes are evident. We investigated the effect of iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analog, on microvascular permeability in a rat striated muscle model. In six control and six experimental animals the cremaster muscle was dissected, placed in a closed-flow acrylic chamber, and suffused with a bicarbonate buffer solution. Dextran labeled with fluorescein was injected intravenously as a macromolecular tracer, and microvascular permeability was determined on the basis of clearance of the fluorescent tracer. Two hours of ischemia were followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. In the experimental group iloprost (0.5 microgram/kg/min) was given in a continuous intravenous infusion. Microvascular permeability increased significantly during reperfusion in both control and experimental animals (p less than 0.0001). Treatment with iloprost, however, significantly attenuated this response compared to the control group, 4.8 +/- 0.3 versus 7.3 +/- 0.5 microliters/gm/min, respectively (p less than 0.0001). Iloprost decreases the rise in vascular permeability after ischemia and reperfusion. Experimental clinical use of iloprost under controlled conditions in the treatment of patients with acute skeletal muscle ischemia appears justified. \nExercise training and coronary collateral circulation. This review examines the potential for an exercise-induced increase in coronary collateral circulation, with specific reference to the role and functional significance of collateral vessels, highlighting animal and human studies in particular, and their inherent methodological limitations. Exercise training may enhance myocardial oxygen supply by promoting transient periods of myocardial ischemia, a potent trigger of collateral growth. Some human studies have shown that moderate-to-high intensity training can result in a higher double product at the onset of angina and/or ischemic ST-segment depression, suggesting that myocardial oxygen supply has increased. Attempts to use thallium-201 exercise scintigraphy to assess myocardial perfusion before and after a physical training program have produced conflicting data, whereas angiographic studies in group trials have, without exception, yielded disappointing results. Thus, direct evidence that exercise stimulates collateralization in humans is lacking. \nDetection of human papillomavirus DNA in cancer of the urinary bladder by in situ hybridisation. The association of the human papillomavirus (HPV) with cancer of the urinary bladder was assessed by in situ hybridisation using probes selective for HPV types 6/11 and 16/18 DNA. No hybridisation signal was detected with the type 6/11 probe on 100 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bladder tumours sampled. However, when the same samples were hybridised with the HPV type 16/18 DNA probe, 11 of 66 (16.6%) papillary and 1 of 10 (10%) solid transitional cell carcinomas gave positive signals. These results suggest the involvement of HPV in cancer of the bladder, although the frequency of multiple HPV types in these tumours is uncertain. \nErythroleukemia in a child associated with monosomy 7. A case of erythroleukemia (EL) associated with monosomy 7 is reported. The EL was diagnosed 20 months after the initial diagnosis of monosomy 7 was made. An immunologic study of the blast cells using a monoclonal antibody was positive for glycophorin A, which suggested that they were of erythroid origin; this was confirmed by electron microscopy. Chemotherapy was started with low dose cytarabine. However, the patient had severe bone marrow suppression and died of pneumonia. Our case shows that monosomy 7 is an abnormality of the pluripotential stem cells, including erythroid cells, that resulted in a true erythroid neoplasm. \nHypertension associated with increased renin concentrations in nephroblastoma. An infant with severe hypertension who had a nephroblastoma which was secreting active renin is described. Nephroblastoma must be included in the differential diagnosis of hypertension associated with increased renin concentrations, even in the absence of an abdominal mass. \nDifferential hemodynamic effects and tolerance properties of nitroglycerin and an S-nitrosothiol in experimental heart failure. S-nitrosothiols are potent in vitro vasodilators, but little is known about their in vivo action. In this study, we compared the effects of S-nitroso N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) and nitroglycerin (NTG) on left ventricular (LV) hemodynamics in congestive heart failure rats. By using a twoday crossover design, stepwise i.v. infusions of SNAP or NTG at 3, 5 and 8 micrograms/min were administered for 30 min each, followed by a dose of 10 micrograms/min over the next 10 h. LV end-diastolic and peak-systolic pressures (LVEDP and LVPSP, respectively) were measured at selected intervals. SNAP and NTG produced maximal LVEDP reductions of 46 and 44%, respectively, at the highest infusion rate. However, at the lower doses, greater reductions of LVEDP were seen with SNAP. NTG had a smaller effect on LVPSP (maximum 6% reduction) than SNAP (maximum reduction of 15%). During the 10-h infusion of NTG, LVEDP gradually returned to base-line values, indicating the development of tolerance, despite relatively constant plasma levels of NTG over the infusion period. Tolerance in LVEDP effects was not observed during the 10-h infusion of SNAP. In the presence of NTG tolerance, rats were still responsive to SNAP (mean reduction of LVEDP 24%), suggesting the absence of cross-tolerance between these two nitrovasodilators. These results suggest that SNAP is a more potent in vivo vasodilator than NTG, has more arterial action than NTG and is less prone to produce LV hemodynamic tolerance. \nPattern of arterial involvement of the head, neck, and eyes in giant cell arteritis: three case reports. The findings of two post-mortem examinations and one CT scan of patients with biopsy proved giant cell arteritis (GCA) are presented. The presence or absence of intracranial involvement in GCA is discussed. \nCoronary artery aneurysms--a case study and literature review. Coronary artery aneurysms are detected with increasing frequency owing to the advent of coronary angiographies. Although most patients with coronary artery aneurysms are asymptomatic, manifestations of myocardial ischemia may occur. The case described herein serves as a basis for a discussion of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, detection, and treatment of coronary artery aneurysms. \nHypercalcemia of advanced malignancy: decision making and the quality of death. Hypercalcemia is a common complication of certain advanced malignancies and although not therapeutically difficult, its presence raises complex ethical issues. Treatment of this condition is most easily justified when the patient is not terminal, the benefits are tangible, and the patient agrees with therapy. Withholding treatment is defensible medically, legally, and morally when a terminal situation is present, when drawbacks exceed the benefits, and when an informed patient declines therapy. Hypercalcemia is one of a number of conditions of dying that can be controlled by the physician. The physician's decision to treat such a condition, in part, depends upon his or her view of a good death. Further study is needed to clarify and avoid those situations of dying which involve suffering. Physicians must begin this difficult analysis and dialogue if they are to fulfill their obligation to minimize suffering in all patients. \nPersistent neurotoxicity of systemically administered interferon-alpha. Fourteen cancer patients had evidence of persistent neurotoxicity of interferon-alpha therapy long after their treatment was discontinued. Although most of the cognitive symptoms were mild to moderate in severity, they were incapacitating to these individuals in their usual work. The neuropsychological test abnormalities were not attributable to subsequent therapy, disease status, or other medical problems. The pattern of deficits was consistent with frontal-subcortical dysfunction. Of the four patients who had follow-up assessment, two had improved and two had deteriorated. These findings suggest that in some cases interferon neurotoxicity is not reversible. \n'Medial maxillectomy' for lateral nasal wall neoplasms. Lateral rhinotomy and \"medial maxillectomy,\" an en bloc resection of the medial maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus with the lamina papyracea, medial orbital floor, and lacrimal fossa-duct, have been advocated for lateral nasal wall neoplasma. Experience with 35 (of 41) patients followed up at least 30 months (median, 57 months) postoperatively is reported. There was a 9% recurrence for benign tumors and 15% for malignant neoplasms, the latter only in the patients with nonmelanoma malignant neoplasms not receiving postoperative radiotherapy. The most frequent complications were cavity crusting, epicanthal scarring, and epiphora. \nDementia: case ascertainment in a community survey. The three-stage East Baltimore Mental Health Survey, conducted in 1981 as part of the Epidemiological Catchment Area Program, provided an opportunity to assess the prevalence of dementia and specific dementing disorders in a community-based, cross-sectional sample of the population. From the 3,841 households originally sampled, 810 individuals were selected for clinical psychiatric evaluation. Forty-one individuals were given a provisional diagnosis and referred to Stage 3 for differential diagnosis, with 32 individuals completing this evaluation. Thorough clinical evaluation of these cases resulted in an overall prevalence of dementia of 4.5% in those 65 years of age and older. The prevalence of specific dementing disorders was Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2.0%), Multi-Infarct Dementia (MID) (2.0%) and Mixed Dementia (MD) (0.5%). Prevalence increased with age for all dementias: Non-Whites had higher rates of dementia than Whites; females had higher rates of AD while males had higher rates of MID; and the prevalence of AD increased with increasing education, whereas the prevalence of MID decreased with increased education. Although this study includes only a small number of cases, necessitating some caution in interpreting the results, these figures do represent an estimate of the prevalence of severe dementing disorders and provide a basis for further community study. \nPapular mucinosis in L-tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Five patients with the L-tryptophan-related eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome had a generalized eruption of flesh-colored papules. In all patients, histologic examination revealed a focal accumulation of mucin in the upper mid dermis, associated with increased dermal cellularity. The mucin was composed predominantly of hyaluronic acid, with small amounts of sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. The cells within the lesion were fibroblasts. The lesions slowly regressed after L-tryptophan was discontinued. Proposed explanations for the L-tryptophan-related eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome have centered on contaminants, chemically related to L-tryptophan, introduced in the manufacturing process. Tryptophan metabolites have been linked with sclerotic cutaneous diseases but have not been previously implicated in cutaneous mucinoses. \nFludarabine: a review. The new fluorinated adenine analog, fludarabine, has been tested for efficacy in many tumor types over the past ten years. Two other similar nucleoside analogs are currently available for commercial use. Cytarabine is used principally as an antileukemic agent, and vidarabine as an antiviral. Unlike vidarabine, fludarabine is resistant to deactivation by adenosine deaminase. Data from Phase I and II trials suggest that fludarabine is potentially effective in a number of leukemias, including acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Unfortunately, the doses required to achieve adequate response in the acute leukemias (greater than 75 mg/m2) were above the maximum tolerated dose, resulting in intolerable granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a life-threatening neurotoxic syndrome. In CLL: however, the dose required to achieve a satisfactory response is well within tolerated limits. Long-term survival statistics are not yet available, but historical perspective strongly correlates response to other agents with increased survival times. Toxicities seen at dose regimens of 15-40 mg/m2/d for five consecutive days include somnolence, metabolic acidosis, confusion, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, increase in serum creatinine and aminotransferase concentrations, and pulmonary and hepatic abnormalities. Mild to severe hematologic toxicity has been observed at all dose levels. \nEndovascular treatment of intracerebral arteriovenous malformations: experience in 49 cases. The authors report the results of treatment in 49 consecutive patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) who underwent therapeutic embolization with liquid adhesive agents between 1984 and 1988 at the Toronto Western Hospital. Thirty-three patients had no other treatment and were followed up with angiography at 2 years and clinically from 2 to 6 years. Of the other 16 patients, 10 had adjunctive radiosurgery and six underwent surgical resection following embolization. Seven (14%) of the 49 patients had a morphological cure effected by embolization as evidenced on their 2-year follow-up angiograms: these have remained clinically stable. Twelve patients developed neurological deficits after embolization; eight (16% of the series) were transient and four (8%) were permanent. Two patients (4%) had a delayed hemorrhage after incomplete obliteration of their malformations. Endovascular treatment resulted in clinical improvement in 15 (33%) of the other 46 patients. None of the patients who initially presented with hemorrhage had a rebleed following embolization. It is concluded that endovascular treatment with liquid embolic material can be an integral part of the multidisciplinary treatment protocol for patients with brain AVM's. \nUpper gastrointestinal lesions in elderly patients presenting for endoscopy: relevance of NSAID usage. The occurrence of upper gastrointestinal disease and the relevance of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) usage were documented in 511 consecutive patients (321 women, 190 men) over 70 yr old, referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a district general hospital. The findings were benign esophageal disease (43%), normal (15%), gastric ulcer (11.5%), and duodenal ulcer (11%). Gastric ulcers were more common in women taking NSAIDs (25%) than in NSAID abstainers (7%) p less than 0.001 and male NSAID users (8%) p less than 0.001. Esophagitis and esophageal stricture were not influenced by NSAID usage, but gastric erosions were more common (10% vs. 3%) p less than 0.01. Of 142 patients receiving NSAIDs, 41% presented with hemorrhage, compared with 20.5% of NSAID abstainers (p less than 0.001). Hemorrhage was as common in aspirin takers (15 of 33, 45%) as in standard-dose NANSAID takers (43 of 109, 39%), even though 86% were taking 300 mg of aspirin per day or less. In elderly patients, esophageal disease is common. NSAID use, even low-dose aspirin, is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage. In females, NSAID usage is associated with gastric ulcer. \nComparison of restorative proctocolectomy with and without covering ileostomy in ulcerative colitis. The experience of restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis is reported in 16 consecutive patients with no covering ileostomy (group 2) in comparison with 15 patients with a covering stoma (group 1); in each group a J pouch was constructed. All patients had pre- and postoperative clinical and manometric evaluations of the functional result up to 12 months. There were no deaths or permanent failures. The number of early complications was four in each group. Re-ileostomy was needed in one patient of group 1, and an ileostomy was constructed in three patients of group 2. At 1 year after operation the functional results did not differ between groups 1 and 2 in terms of daily frequency of defaecation (mean 5.6 and 5.4 in 24 h respectively), or in terms of anal basal or maximal squeeze pressures. There was a significant (P less than 0.01) saving in total hospital stay (median 11 days) and in operating theatre time (mean 41 min) in patients with no covering ileostomy. It is concluded that a covering ileostomy may be unnecessary in restorative proctocolectomy, at least in suitable cases with no technical difficulty at the time of operation. \nCharacterization of severely and profoundly hearing impaired adults attending an audiology clinic. Despite the fact that around 12 per cent of adult patients attending an audiology department will be severely hearing impaired (pure tone averages of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz of 70 dB HL or worse in the better hearing ear), their clinical and audiometric characteristics have not been well documented. These characteristics were collected prospectively in 132 adult patients attending a Severe Impairment Clinic, set up to manage their specific problems. The inability to provide sufficient masking makes audiometric assessment of the severity of the impairment uncertain in the poorer hearing ear in 52 per cent of these patients. In addition, the limited bone conduction output makes it almost invariably impossible to assess the masked bone conduction thresholds and hence the air-bone gap in the poorer ear. Hence, accurate characterization is only practical of the better hearing ear in such patients. In 67 per cent of the better hearing ears, there was a mixed hearing impairment, the air-bone gap being 20 dB or greater. The aetiology of the conductive component was almost equally otosclerosis and chronic otitis media. In only 19 per cent was the impairment of a pure sensorineural type, broken down as 6 per cent congenitally acquired, 5 per cent due to meningitis and 9 per cent being adult in onset. In the remaining 14 per cent of patients the type of impairment could not be classified as the bone conductive thresholds were off scale. Having had experience of managing these patients at a special clinic and knowing the workload involved, it is argued that consideration be given to setting up such clinics in most departments. \nAgglutination of blood cardioplegia by cold-reacting autoantibodies. Cold-reacting autoantibodies occasionally occur in patients requiring cardiac operations. This report describes the clinical course of 1 patient with cold-reacting autoantibodies and intracoronary agglutination of the blood cardioplegia solution. Observations made in vivo and in vitro are considered in discussing recommendations for the management of extracorporeal circulation and cardioplegic arrest in patients with clinically silent cold-reacting autoantibodies. \nToward an integrated understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. I. Medical and pathophysiological aspects. Fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is a chronic pain disorder characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal soreness, stiffness, non-restorative sleep and psychological disturbance. At present, much about the etiology, pathological mechanisms and course of FS are unknown. Indeed, standardized diagnostic criteria have only been recently agreed upon. The present paper is the first of a two-part series which reviews the extant empirical literature concerning FS, with a view to arriving at an integrated understanding of the syndrome. The present paper describes the clinical presentation of FS and historical conceptualizations of the disorder. Available research on pathophysiological mechanisms in FS is then presented. In this section we have included literature concerning histology of muscle, sleep architecture, neurotransmitter anomalies and neuropeptide involvement in FS symptomatology. \nPeripheral ameloblastoma: a clinical and histologic study of 11 cases. Peripheral ameloblastoma (PA) is a rare odontogenic tumor. Previously, only 39 cases of PA had been reported in the English literature. In this article 11 additional cases of PA are presented. Concordance with previous cases was evident with regard to race, clinical appearance, and site of predilection. However, differences were observed with regard to age, sex distribution, and predominant histologic pattern. The average age in the current cases is younger, there is no male bias, and the most common histologic pattern is plexiform rather than follicular or acanthomatous. Recurrence following simple excision is rare, but has been reported. Long-term postoperative follow-up is recommended. \nPrimary breast lymphoma. Primary breast lymphoma (PBL) is a rare tumor of the breast. Three cases of PBL are being described. All three cases achieved remission following biopsy, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. The literature is extensively reviewed with emphasis on true incidence of PBL and survival rates. \nHigh-attenuation mediastinal masses on unenhanced CT. On unenhanced CT scans, a variety of mediastinal masses contain areas with attenuation values higher than the attenuation value of the chest wall musculature. The increased attenuation may be diffuse or focal and may be a result of calcium deposition, high iodine content, or areas of acute hemorrhage. This report illustrates the gamut of high-attenuation mediastinal masses seen on unenhanced CT. Masses that are of high attenuation only on IV contrast-enhanced images (e.g., aberrant vessels) are not included. \nSubeschar tissue fluid: a source of cell-mediated immune suppression in victims of severe thermal injury. Thermal injury results in pronounced physiologic alterations in microcirculation at the site of tissue damage. The consequence of these changes is an increase in microvascular permeability, leading to the accumulation of tissue edema, or subeschar tissue fluid (STF). One of the adverse properties of edema is its capacity in vitro to inhibit cell-mediated immune function. Since previous studies evaluated STF collected 5 to 7 days after thermal injury, the present study was designed to determine the time frame during which STF demonstrates its immune suppressive nature. Seven patients with severe thermal injury (30% to 100% total body surface area) were entered into the study. STF was collected in serial fashion, beginning as early as 9 hours after injury and continuing until fascial excision or patient death (maximum of 139 hours after injury). The addition of STF to cultures of lymphocytes obtained from healthy donors resulted in complete inhibition of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation (MILP). Serum collected concomitantly from this group of patients was also capable of inhibiting MILP. From its inception, STF possesses the ability to inhibit MILP; this suppressive nature is stable, persisting for prolonged periods of time. The gradual absorption of STF likely contributes to the serologic evidence of cell-mediated immune suppression documented in victims of severe thermal injury. \nProtooncogenes and growth factors associated with normal and abnormal liver growth. Hepatocyte replication during liver regeneration depends on extrinsic (circulating) and intrinsic (intrahepatic) factors. Two important growth factors produced in the regenerating liver are discussed, TGF alpha, an autocrine, stimulatory growth factor, and TGF beta, a paracrine inhibitory factor. The balance between the activities of these factors is likely to play an important role in regulating hepatocyte proliferation. The expression of some protooncogenes occurs sequentially during the first few hours after partial hepatectomy and is a marker for the entry of hepatocytes into the cell cycle (proliferative competence). As hepatocytes become competent to proliferate, they respond to TGF alpha and other growth factors and enter a proliferative phase. It is possible that TGF beta 1 serves as a stop signal for liver regeneration but the mechanisms by which TGF beta inhibits hepatocyte DNA synthesis are still unknown. \nRelation of psychopathology in general medical inpatients to use and cost of services. The authors investigated the relation between psychopathology in medically ill inpatients and use and cost of medical care services. Of 455 medical inpatients, the Medical Inpatient Screening Test identified 27.9% as very depressed, 27.5% as very anxious, 20.2% as having cognitive dysfunction, and 8.6% as having high pain levels. Overall, the test identified 51% of the patients as having high levels of psychopathology or pain. These subjects had a 40% longer median length of hospital stay and 35% greater mean hospital costs than those with low levels of psychopathology or pain. Patients with greater psychopathology also had higher hospital charges, more procedures during hospitalization, and more discharge diagnoses but did not differ from the other patients in sex, race, age, diagnosis-related group (DRG) major diagnostic category, or DRG weight. \nEnhancement of pulsed-dye laser ablation of arterial tissues with blood medium: effects of laser-induced shock waves. The influence of blood medium on tissue ablation by a pulsed dye laser and its selectivity for atheroma were investigated. The role of shock waves on tissue ablation was also evaluated. Normal and atherosclerotic human aortas were irradiated by a 480 nm pulsed dye laser activated at 5 Hz. The laser was coupled with a single 0.2 mm fiber (Uni-guide) (40 mjoules/pulse) or a multifiber catheter (14 x 150 microns) (100 mjoules/pulse). Shock waves were measured using a fluid-filled catheter connected to a strain gauge manometer. With the Uni-guide, pulse-dye lasing resulted in greater ablation of atheroma in blood (11.6 x 10(-3) mm3/joule, p less than 0.001 versus atheroma measured in saline and normal tissue in blood) followed by normal tissue in blood (2.5 x 10(-3)mm3/joule), atheroma in saline (1.71 x 10(-3)mm3/joule, p less than 0.05 versus normal tissue in saline), and normal tissue in saline (0.54 x 10(-3) mm3/joule). With the multifiber catheter, laser ablation was the greatest in atheroma in blood (0.55 +/- 0.26 mm3/joule p less than 0.001 versus atheroma in saline and normal tissue in blood), followed by normal tissue in blood (0.27 +/- 0.12 mm3/joule), atheroma in saline (0.14 +/- 0.15 mm3/joule, p less than 0.001 versus normal tissue in saline), and normal tissue in saline (0 mm3/joule). The ablation efficiency of the multifiber catheter was greater than that of the Uni-guide (p less than 0.0001). \nIsolated incisional metastases after intraperitoneal radioactive chromic phosphate therapy for ovarian carcinoma. Two women developed apparently isolated recurrences of ovarian carcinoma involving prior incisions after receiving intraperitoneal radioactive chromic phosphate (P-32) adjuvant therapy for early epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Both are alive without evidence of disease at second-look laparotomy after surgical resection of the abdominal wall metastases and cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Mechanisms of cutaneous and incisional implantation metastases are discussed. Adjuvant therapy with intraperitoneal P-32 is unable to provide systemic therapy for occult metastatic disease. The favorable outcome in these cases probably reflects limited tumor burden at the time of recurrence and stands in stark contrast to other cases of soft tissue recurrences of ovarian carcinoma reported previously. \nBlockade of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel modulates reactive hyperemia in the canine coronary circulation. The mechanism of reactive hyperemia remains unknown. We hypothesized that reactive hyperemia was related to the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels during coronary occlusion. The resulting hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cell plasma membrane might reduce calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels and result in relaxation of smooth muscle tone and vasodilation. In eight open-chest, anesthetized dogs, 30-second coronary occlusions resulted in an average flow debt repayment of 200 +/- 41%. After low-dose (0.8 mumol/min) and high-dose (3.7 mumol/min) infusion of intracoronary glibenclamide, flow debt repayment fell to 76 +/- 14% and 50 +/- 8%, respectively (p less than 0.05 compared with control for both). The decline in flow debt repayment was due to a significant reduction both in maximum coronary conductance during reactive hyperemia and in its duration. In addition, there was a significant decline in the sensitivity of the coronary circulation to adenosine-induced vasodilation after glibenclamide. While more variable, there was no overall change in the sensitivity of the coronary vasculature to acetylcholine-induced vasodilation after glibenclamide. We conclude that reactive hyperemia is determined in a large part by the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, probably through its effect on membrane potential and voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Because reactive hyperemia was never fully abolished at the highest doses of glibenclamide tested, it is possible that additional mechanisms are involved in the genesis of this complex phenomenon. \nVolume tests for chronic venous insufficiency: an appraisal. Chronic venous disease is increasingly treated surgically with a variety of experimental procedures. Noninvasive volume tests are commonly used before surgery to select patients and after surgery to assess results. Rapid volume changes are considered to indicate regurgitation. Rigorous statistical validation of tests and the confounding nature of unmeasured arterial inflow are seldom considered. Volume changes were measured in 29 control limbs and 35 limbs with venous disease, with mercury-in-silicone rubber strain gauges, for both exercise and elevation. Normalization for arterial flow permitted calculation of the regurgitation rate. Normal (95% confidence) limits for measured and calculated parameters were determined. Specificity was shown by the percent of normal parameter values for control limbs and sensitivity by the percent of abnormal values for extremities with venous disease. Arterial flow significantly altered volume curves. Normalization increased specificity and sensitivity significantly. Calf exercise tests, even normalized, were too insensitive to be reliable. Elevation tests were significantly more sensitive for determining regurgitation. However, exercise tests were useful and supplied important information about the calf muscle pump. We conclude that, as currently used, many limb volume test procedures are unsuitable but could be improved significantly by normalization to reduce the confounding effect of regional arterial flow and use of an elevation test to measure regurgitation. \nIdentification of a mutation in porcine ryanodine receptor associated with malignant hyperthermia. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) causes neurological, liver, and kidney damage and death in humans and major economic losses in the swine industry. A single point mutation in the porcine gene for the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (ryr1) was found to be correlated with MH in five major breeds of lean, heavily muscled swine. Haplotyping suggests that the mutation in all five breeds has a common origin. Assuming that this is the causal mutation for MH, the development of a noninvasive diagnostic test will provide the basis for elimination of the MH gene or its controlled inclusion in swine breeding programs. \nSevere oral phenytoin overdose does not cause cardiovascular morbidity. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for cardiovascular toxicity from severe oral phenytoin overdose. STUDY POPULATION: Fifty-seven patients admitted during a two-year period to an inner-city hospital for severe oral phenytoin overdose, which is defined as a peak level of 40 micrograms/mL or more. METHODS: Case records were reviewed retrospectively for symptoms and signs of phenytoin toxicity, especially circulatory effects. Baseline and toxic 12-lead ECGs, when available, were reviewed in detail. Continuous variables were compared using either paired or unpaired t tests, as appropriate. Significance was taken as P less than or equal to .05. RESULTS: Mean peak phenytoin level was 49.4 +/- 7.7 micrograms/mL. Continuous single-lead ECG monitoring in 36 patients (63%) for a mean of 26.5 +/- 21.6 hours revealed no incidents of dysrhythmia requiring treatment. ECGs recorded during toxicity in 52 cases (91%) revealed no clinically significant abnormalities attributable to phenytoin. ECGs during toxic and baseline states were available for detailed analysis in 15 cases. Ten patients exhibited an increase in PR interval (mean, 19 +/- 10 ms) when toxic, whereas five had a decrease (mean, 18 +/- 11 ms) compared with nontoxic records. No change in heart rate, QRS duration, or corrected QT interval was observed. There were no circulatory complications and no deaths. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular toxicity is rarely a manifestation of oral phenytoin overdose. Routine management of stable patients with severe phenytoin overdose in a monitored setting is not mandatory. \nNeurotoxicity of intraventricularly administered alpha-interferon for leptomeningeal disease. Nine patients with leptomeningeal disease are reported who were treated with intraventricular alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). In seven of these patients, a progressive vegetative state developed during treatment. The patients became unresponsive to verbal commands but opened their eyes with auditory or tactile stimulation. It took an average of 3 weeks for these patients to become verbally responsive after treatment was discontinued. Electroencephalographic findings showed evidence of irritative involvement of the deep midline nuclei in 80% of patients. Periventricular white matter changes developed during treatment in three of six patients who underwent computed tomographic scans. All patients with this severe neurotoxicity received whole-brain irradiation before treatment. Possible mechanisms for the development of this neurotoxic syndrome are discussed. The neurotoxicity of alpha-IFN and brain irradiation may be additive, suggesting a cautious approach when using this combination for treatment. \nEffects of positive end-expiratory pressure on splanchnic circulation and function in experimental peritonitis. Splanchnic and central hemodynamic effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were studied in anesthetized pigs using mechanical ventilatory assistance, with or without sepsis (fecal peritonitis). One hour after sepsis, PEEP (10 cm H2O) was applied (n = 6). Another group (n = 6) had sepsis without PEEP. In one group (n = 6) without sepsis, PEEP was applied after 1 hour, while a fourth group (n = 5), without sepsis or PEEP, served as a control. The group with PEEP and sepsis had reduced cardiac index, portal venous blood flow, and liver surface blood flow. The group with PEEP alone had reduced splanchnic circulation by increasing gastrointestinal vascular resistance, while the group with sepsis alone had increased portal vascular resistance. In a separate series with sepsis, intermittent PEEP, and vigorous fluid resuscitation, it was demonstrated that avoiding hypovolemia did not seem to protect from the PEEP effects on the splanchnic circulation. The combination of sepsis and PEEP was not additive on portal blood flow reduction but reduced bile production. \nFactors affecting survival of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in a West Virginia community. The hospital records for patients treated for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in southern West Virginia during a recent five year period were reviewed. The over-all mortality rate was 62 per cent. Patients with intraperitoneal rupture had a higher mortality rate (97 per cent) than patients with retroperitoneal rupture (25 per cent). Patients at increased risk were more than 80 years of age, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms before seeking medical attention, had preoperative systolic blood pressure levels of less than 90 millimeters of mercury and had a preoperative hemoglobin level of less than 8. Other factors associated with death were a delay in beginning surgical treatment, a larger total blood loss and amount of blood transfused. The results of multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope and the amount of blood loss were, in large part, reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality. The most effective method of preventing fatal outcome is elective resection of the aneurysms before rupture occurs. \nAnticonvulsant profiles of the potent and orally active GABA uptake inhibitors SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A and four prototype antiepileptic drugs in mice and rats. The anticonvulsant profiles of two potent and orally active gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake inhibitors, 1-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-3-piperidine-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (SK&F 89976-A) and 1-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3-pyridine-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (SK&F 100330-A), were determined with a battery of well-standardized tests in mice and rats and compared with the profiles of phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), valproate (VPA) and clonazepam (CZP) when subjected to the same tests. ED50 values were calculated and compared with TD50 values for minimal motor impairment to provide protective indexes (PI = TD50/ED50). The anticonvulsant profiles of SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A were similar and suggest that these compounds raise the threshold for seizure initiation rather than inhibit seizure spread. Like intraperitoneal (i.p.) PHT, CBZ, VPA, and CZP, SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A inhibited seizures in corneally kindled rats. The profiles of SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A were most similar to that of CZP and virtually opposite to that of PHT. Intraperitoneal SK&F 100330-A provided complete protection against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures [subcutaneous (s.c.) PTZ] in mice but was ineffective against seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES) at doses slightly greater than its TD50. SK&F 100330-A provided complete protection against picrotoxin-induced seizures (s.c. Pic) and against both clonus and forelimb tonic extension induced by NMDA N-methyl-D-aspartate [intracerebral ventricular (i.c.v.)-NMDA] in mice; however, SK&F 100330-A was ineffective against seizures induced by bicuculline (s.c. Bic) and strychnine (s.c. Strych) at doses slightly greater than its TD50. SK&F 89976-A was similar but provided partial protection against NMDA-induced clonus. \nAn in vivo model for the neurodegenerative effects of beta amyloid and protection by substance P. Deposition of the beta-amyloid protein in senile plaques is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Focal deposition of beta amyloid in the adult rat cerebral cortex caused profound neurodegenerative changes, including neuronal loss and degenerating neurons and neurites. Chronic induction of the Alz-50 antigen appeared in neurons around focal cortical deposits of beta amyloid. Immunoblot analysis showed that beta amyloid induced Alz-50-immunoreactive proteins in rat cerebral cortex that were very similar to the proteins induced in human cerebral cortex from patients with AD. The neuropeptide substance P prevented beta-amyloid-induced neuronal loss and expression of Alz-50 proteins when coadministered into the cerebral cortex. Systemic administration of substance P also provided protection against the effects of intracerebral beta amyloid. Thus, beta amyloid is a potent neurotoxin in the adult brain in vivo, and its effects can be blocked by substance P. \nChronic prosthetic vascular graft infection visualized with technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime-labeled leukocytes Technetium-99m-HMPAO labeled leukocytes demonstrated chronic femoro-femoral prosthetic vascular graft infection several times during an 18-mo period in a 77-yr-old man. The intensity and distribution of the uptake in the graft were fluctuating in different imaging occasions possibly indicating the strength and location of the infection. Gallium-67-citrate imaging showed negative results twice. The reason for negative 67Ga results remained obscure. The infected graft was removed and the patient did well 5 mo postoperatively. \nNo effect of zidovudine on hepatitis B virus replication in homosexual men with symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Zidovudine triphosphate inhibits the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase (DNAp) in vitro. Serial measurements of serum HBV DNAp activity and HBV DNA were made in 14 consecutive male homosexual patients starting zidovudine for symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Median duration of treatment was 15 weeks (range 2-72). In the 13 patients with detectable DNAp/DNA pre-treatment, no significant change in either measure of viral replication was observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment compared with the 13 weeks prior to treatment. The lack of response may be due to the opposing effect of immunosuppression, or to a failure of in vivo activity. \nTumor invasion of the chest wall and mediastinum in lung cancer: evaluation with pneumothorax CT. For preoperative evaluation of chest wall and mediastinal invasion by lung cancer, computed tomography (CT), combined with artificial pneumothorax (pneumothorax CT), was performed in 43 patients with lung cancer in whom conventional CT scans showed that the mass was contiguous to the chest wall (n = 30) and/or mediastinum (n = 25) but without evidence of definite tumor invasion. Invasion was diagnosed on the basis of whether an air space existed between the mass and the adjacent structures. In three patients pneumothorax was not produced. After the procedure, four patients developed symptomatic pneumothorax, and one, subcutaneous emphysema. Comparison of diagnoses based on findings at pneumothorax CT, surgery, and pathologic examination showed that pneumothorax CT is 100% accurate for chest wall invasion and 76% accurate for mediastinal invasion. The authors conclude that this procedure is helpful in accurate evaluation of the T criterion in lung cancer, especially for patients in whom findings at conventional CT suggest tumor invasion of the chest wall and mediastinum. \nAlpha 2 macroglobulin state in acute pancreatitis. Raised values of alpha 2 macroglobulin-protease complexes in severe and mild attacks. Plasma values of C reactive protein, alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor, alpha 2 macroglobulin, and complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin have been determined in serial samples from 27 patients with acute pancreatitis. Complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin was measured by a novel enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with a monoclonal antibody specific for the complexed form. Patients with severe illness had lower concentrations of total alpha 2 macroglobulin and higher concentrations of complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin than those with mild illness, and in the majority of severe attacks the abnormal amounts of complexed alpha 2 macroglobulin were present throughout the eight days of the study. The proportion of total alpha 2 macroglobulin in the uncomplexed form, however, was generally greater than 90%, and in 26% of the mild cases completely normal concentrations of uncomplexed alpha 2 macroglobulin (greater than 99% of total) were found throughout the eight days of the study. This suggests that exhaustion of alpha 2 macroglobulin in plasma is unlikely to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. \nDepression of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity characterizes patients with early myocardial reinfarction after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy. Twenty patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) had endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels measured throughout the hospital period and those levels were prospectively correlated with the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction until 8 weeks after hospital discharge. Within the follow-up period, recurrent myocardial infarction was observed in 8 patients, whereas the remaining 12 patients showed no clinical evidence of recurrence. The patients in the reinfarction group were characterized by a more pronounced depletion of and sustained lower levels of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity than were the patients with no reinfarction (p less than 0.05). The decrease in fibrinolytic activity during rt-PA therapy was significantly associated with a depletion of functional alpha 2-antiplasmin, the primary plasmin inhibitor. These results indicate that, paradoxically, coronary thrombolysis with rt-PA involves depletion of endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels, which constitutes a risk for early myocardial reinfarction. \nArthroscopic stapling for detached superior glenoid labrum. Superior labral tears of the shoulder involve the biceps tendon and labrum complex which may be detached, displaced inferiorly, and interposed between the glenoid and the humeral head. We have treated ten young athletes with painful shoulders due to this lesion by arthroscopic stapling. Arthroscopy at the time of staple removal, after three to six months, showed that all the lesions had been stabilised. Clinical review at over 24 months showed an excellent or good result in 80%. The two relative failures were due in one to residual subacromial bursitis, and the other to multidirectional shoulder instability. Arthroscopic stapling can restore the shoulder anatomy, and it is recommended for active adolescent athletes with this lesion. \nPercutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump: emphasis on complications. In a review of our 5-year experience with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) insertion I examined the complications of percutaneous IABP placement in 93 patients, and compared them with those reported in other studies in the literature. I analyzed several variables that may affect the complication rate. Of 78 patients in our series who had percutaneous IABP cardiac assist, 15 (19%) had complications, which falls into the acceptable range reported by others. Among 15 patients who had surgical placement of an IABP, the complication rate was similar at 20%. The complication rate after IABP insertions done by surgeons primarily in the operating room was compared with that from insertions done by cardiologists in the catheterization laboratory. The overall complication rate was found to be higher in the second group, 28.0% compared with 12.8%. The application of the IABP in cardiogenic shock was associated with a high complication rate (46%). On the other hand, its insertion before cardiac surgery was associated with a relatively low complication rate (9.5%). \nLeft ventricular outflow obstruction resulting from insertion of mitral prostheses leaving the native leaflets intact: adverse clinical outcome in seven patients. Left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction may result from retaining the anterior mitral leaflet when a mitral prosthesis is inserted in the mitral anulus. We retrospectively reviewed the echocardiograms (two-dimensional Doppler and Doppler color flow imaging, or transesophageal with color flow imaging) obtained in seven patients with preoperative mitral regurgitation who had a prosthesis implanted with the native mitral leaflets left intact. Systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet, as seen in dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction, was observed in six of seven patients. LV fractional shortening preoperatively was less than or equal to 0.25 in all (mean 0.20 +/- 0.04) and did not significantly (p = ns) increase postoperatively (mean 0.27 +/- 0.12). Color flow imaging revealed disturbed systolic flow in the LV outflow tract in five patients, and all had systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet. Continuous wave Doppler detected significant systolic LV outflow tract jets in five patients averaging 4.1 +/- 0.9 m/sec. Mitral prosthetic function was normal (pressure half-time of 81 +/- 25 msec and mean gradient of 7 +/- 3 mm Hg +/- SD) in five patients. Clinical follow-up revealed that all had died, six of them within 2 months of their operation. Thus systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet occurs commonly after prosthetic mitral valve insertion with the native leaflets left intact. Continuous wave Doppler often demonstrates increased systolic LV outflow tract velocities consistent with dynamic LV outflow obstruction. \nPeriorbital necrobiotic xanthogranuloma and stage I multiple myeloma. Ultrastructure and response to pulsed dexamethasone documented by magnetic resonance imaging. We observed a 40-year-old woman with necrobiotic xanthogranuloma from the inception of indurated eyelid and periorbital infiltrates and concurrent stage I multiple myeloma to resolution of infiltrates in skin and bone marrow after pulsed high-dose oral dexamethasone therapy. Ultrastructural studies revealed lipid vacuoles in epidermal keratinocytes, in dermal histiocytic macrophages, and in vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells. The presence of lipid vacuoles in epidermal keratinocytes has not been reported previously in xanthogranuloma. \nFailed back surgery syndrome: 5-year follow-up after spinal cord stimulator implantation. Spinal cord stimulation, in use for more than 20 years, has evolved into an easily implemented technique, with percutaneous methods for electrode placement. We have reviewed our experience with this technique in treating \"failed back surgery syndrome,\" and have assessed patient and treatment characteristics as predictors of long-term outcome. A series of 50 patients with failed back surgery syndrome (averaging 3.1 previous operations), who underwent spinal cord stimulator implantation, was interviewed by impartial third parties, at mean follow-up intervals of 2.2 years and 5.0 years. Successful outcome (at least 50% sustained relief of pain and patient satisfaction with the result) was recorded in 53% of patients at 2.2 years and in 47% of patients at 5.0 years postoperatively. Ten of 40 patients who were disabled preoperatively returned to work. Improvements in activities of daily living were recorded in most patients for most activities; loss of function was rare. Most patients reduced or eliminated analgesic intake. Statistical analysis (including univariate and multivariate logistic regression) of patient characteristics as prognostic factors showed significant advantages for female patients and for those with programmable multi-contact implanted devices. These results, in patients with postsurgical lumbar arachnoid and epidural fibrosis and without surgically remediable lesions, compare favorably with the results in two separate series of patients with failed back surgery syndrome, in whom 1) surgical lesions were diagnosed and repeated operation performed; and 2) monoradicular pain syndromes were diagnosed and dorsal root ganglionectomies performed at our institution. This suggests the need for further assessment of selection criteria, critical analysis of treatment outcome, and prospective study of spinal cord stimulation and alternative approaches to failed back surgery syndrome. \nAntiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy in unstable angina. In 4 well-controlled clinical trials, aspirin reduced the incidence of coronary events in unstable angina. The benefits were present during the acute, subacute and more chronic phases of the disease and were independent of the doses and of other protocol differences. This benefit of aspirin can be extended to some, but not all, other antiplatelet drugs. In 4 clinical trials, heparin used acutely added substantial benefit to the management of unstable angina, reducing the event rate and also the incidence of refractory angina more than aspirin. The long-term benefit of antithrombin therapy remains to be more thoroughly investigated. Despite these successes, the failure rate of aspirin and of heparin remains high, justifying a continuing search for more potent and safe antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs. \nCarbon dioxide laser ablation of cutaneous metastases from malignant melanoma. Multiple cutaneous and superficial subcutaneous metastases from malignant melanoma in 30 patients were treated palliatively by carbon dioxide laser ablation when lesions were to numerous, too large or recurring too rapidly for multiple local excisions. The number of lesions per patient ranged from three to 250 (median 30). Patients were treated under local or general anaesthetic and as day cases or inpatients. After a median follow-up interval of 8 months fewer than 1 per cent of lasered metastases have recurred locally. Sixteen patients have developed cutaneous metastases at other sites requiring further treatment. Approximately 2000 lesions have been treated on 64 occasions. Patients reported little or no pain after the operation and required only simple dry dressings. Wounds were completely healed in 2-6 weeks with good cosmetic results. This simple and effective treatment is becoming an alternative to isolated limb perfusion. \nUse of endoscopy in peptic ulcer disease. The diagnosis and treatment of acute bleeding caused by peptic ulcer disease has been greatly facilitated by fiberoptic endoscopy. The basic differentiation between malignant and benign gastric ulcer requires endoscopic confirmation with biopsy. The management of bleeding from peptic ulceration can be enhanced by endoscopic examination as can the prediction of risk for recurrent bleeding or need for surgical intervention. Various therapeutic maneuvers can be performed endoscopically, including monopolar and multipolar cautery, laser and heater probe therapy, and injection of vasoconstrictors to control bleeding. Endoscopic balloon dilation for the management of gastric outlet obstruction is often effective. \nOptic chiasmal neuritis. In four of six patients with clinical optic chiasmal neuritis, MRI demonstrated abnormalities of the chiasm. Optic chiasmal neuritis may be the initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis, a reflection of established CNS demyelination, or an isolated clinical finding. \nMR imaging evaluation of endometrial carcinoma: results of an NCI cooperative study. A prospective study to assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of endometrial carcinoma was undertaken by five institutions under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute. Six different MR imagers were used, ranging in magnetic field strength from 0.15 T to 1.5 T. For each unit, appropriate T1- and T2-weighted sequences in the transverse plane and T2-weighted sequences in the sagittal plane were used. Initially, 107 patients were entered in the study, but only 88 fulfilled all the criteria and provide the basis for this study. The abnormality within the endometrial cavity was demonstrated with MR imaging in 81% of the patients. The overall accuracy with MR imaging for staging endometrial carcinoma was 85%. In the evaluation of depth of myometrial invasion for stage I disease, overall accuracy with MR imaging was 74%. The accuracy of MR imaging in assessing tumors confined to endometrium or tumor with superficial myometrial invasion was 89% and decreased to 54% in assessing deep myometrial invasion. The results of this prospective study performed by multiple examiners with vastly different equipment demonstrate the inherent value of MR imaging in the evaluation of this neoplasm. \nEffect of prazosin treatment on HDL kinetics in patients with hypertension. The effect of prazosin treatment on blood pressure, plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration, and apoprotein-AI/HDL (apoAI/HDL) kinetics was studied in 11 patients with mild hypertension. Blood pressure (mean +/- SEM) fell from 143 +/- 1/96 +/- 1 to 134 +/- 1/86 +/- 1 mm Hg after 4 to 5 months of prazosin treatment (P less than .001), associated with an increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration from 38 +/- 2 to 46 +/- 2 mg/dL (P less than .001). Both the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and total synthetic rate of apoAI/HDL, which were higher than previous reported values for normal individuals, decreased from 0.36 +/- 0.02 to 0.30 +/- 0.02 L/day and 17.4 +/- 1.1 to 13.8 +/- 1.1 mg/kg/min, respectively. These changes were statistically significant, and the post-treatment values for both variables were now within the normal range. When the decay curve was further analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting, it was shown that the return to normal of the FCR of apoAI/HDL in patients treated with prazosin was accounted for by the decrease of the decay constants of the second [p(2)] and third [p(3)] components of the 125I-AI/HDL disappearance curve. In conclusion, abnormalities in HDL concentration and HDL kinetics exist in patients with very mild hypertension. These defects were significantly improved with prazosin treatment, and this may render the compound of particular clinical benefit in the treatment of patients with mild hypertension. \nPaediatric haemangiomas: the role of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy currently maintains an occasional place in the therapy of complicated haemangiomas of childhood. Eight such childhood benign lesions have been so treated at St Bartholomew's Hospital in the last 10 years. The case histories are presented before being discussed in the context of other therapies available (no treatment, steroids, embolism and surgery), radiation technique used and radiation dose prescription advised. \nFatal human cyclical neutropenia with unresolving tonsillitis and bilateral cervical abscesses. Human Cyclical Neutropenia is a rare haematological disorder, characterized by periodic oscillations in peripheral neutrophil levels from normal to neutropenic, during which patients experience ulcerative stomatitis, fever, malaise and occasional cutaneous and subcutaneous infections. We present our experience with a fatal case of Human Cyclical Neutropenia together with a brief review of the literature and diagnostic criteria. The paper aims to heighten the clinical awareness of the otolaryngologist to the condition. Close co-operation with the haematologist is essential both for diagnosis and management. \n'Medial maxillectomy' for lateral nasal wall neoplasms. Lateral rhinotomy and \"medial maxillectomy,\" an en bloc resection of the medial maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus with the lamina papyracea, medial orbital floor, and lacrimal fossa-duct, have been advocated for lateral nasal wall neoplasma. Experience with 35 (of 41) patients followed up at least 30 months (median, 57 months) postoperatively is reported. There was a 9% recurrence for benign tumors and 15% for malignant neoplasms, the latter only in the patients with nonmelanoma malignant neoplasms not receiving postoperative radiotherapy. The most frequent complications were cavity crusting, epicanthal scarring, and epiphora. \nEfficacy of slow-release nifedipine on myocardial ischemic episodes in variant angina pectoris. To evaluate the efficacy of slow-release nifedipine (a single dose of 20 mg given at 10 P.M. or 2 doses of 20 mg at 10 P.M. and 6 A.M.) on ischemic episodes in patients with variant angina, a single-blind crossover study with ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed in 15 patients (13 men and 2 women, mean age 63 years). In all, there were 646 ischemic episodes detected with ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during the study period, and 618 episodes of them occurred during placebo periods with a circadian variation. Sixty-nine percent of the episodes in placebo periods were asymptomatic. The number of anginal attacks, nitroglycerin tablets taken, ST-segment elevation and the total ischemic duration significantly decreased during nifedipine therapy compared with results after the placebo therapy period, respectively (p less than 0.01 or 0.05). Twenty-eight ischemic episodes occurred during nifedipine therapy when the plasma level of nifedipine was low. Thus, asymptomatic ischemic episodes more frequently occur than symptomatic episodes and the administration of slow-release nifedipine is highly effective in suppressing not only symptomatic but also asymptomatic myocardial ischemia in patients with variant angina. The timing of the administration of slow-release nifedipine is an important factor in suppressing ischemic episodes. \nNatural history of hepatic haemangiomas: clinical and ultrasound study. Hepatic haemangiomas are the most common benign tumours of the liver and commonly present as incidental findings on sonographic examination of the abdomen. Since little is known of the natural course of these tumours, we performed a clinical and sonographic follow up of 123 haemangioma patients. Our prospective study investigated clinical and sonographic findings in 158 haemangiomas for periods of 12 to 60 months. Ninety nine haemangiomas measured less than 2 cm and had an echogenic pattern; 40 were between 2 cm and 5 cm with a mainly echogenic structure; 19 measured greater than 5 cm and showed a mixed echo pattern. At the first examination only eight patients, all with giant haemangiomas, presented symptoms which could be attributed to the tumour. During follow up only one haemangioma changed in shape and size. One patient who was symptom free at the first examination experienced right upper abdominal quadrant pain during follow up. No deterioration occurred in any of the patients with symptoms at the first examination, and all had a satisfactory quality of life. No complications arose during the follow up period. This study shows that in adults haemangiomas remain stable in size and echo patterns rarely change. Only haemangiomas greater than 5 cm may cause symptoms. Prolonged clinical and sonographic follow up of small and medium sized haemangiomas is not warranted. \nRecent advances in the treatment of breast cancer. Multidisciplinary efforts have defined a number of prognostic factors and newer strategies to improve the outcome of patients with breast cancer. Conservative surgery has led to improved functional and cosmetic results. The development of a number of effective adjuvant regimens has led to improved survival. In patients with stage I disease, several biological characteristics of tumor have been identified that are associated with increased risk of relapse. A multimodality approach to patients with locally advanced disease and inflammatory cancer has resulted in improved survival. A number of hormonal and cytotoxic drug contaminations can palliate metastatic disease, with a small fraction of patients remaining in extended remission. Dose-intensive programs may lead to further improvements in survival of selected patients with this disease. \nMetabolic imaging of patients with cardiomyopathy. The cardiomyopathies comprise a diverse group of illnesses that can be characterized functionally by several techniques. However, the delineation of derangements of regional perfusion and metabolism have been accomplished only relatively recently with positron emission tomography (PET). Regional myocardial accumulation and clearance of 11C-palmitate, the primary myocardial substrate under most conditions, demonstrate marked spatial heterogeneity when studied under fasting conditions or with glucose loading. PET with 11C-palmitate permits the noninvasive differentiation of patients with nonischemic from ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, since patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy demonstrate large zones of intensely depressed accumulation of 11C-palmitate, probably reflecting prior infarction. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy demonstrate relatively unique patterns of myocardial abnormalities of perfusion and metabolism. The availability of new tracers and techniques for the evaluation of myocardial metabolism (11C-acetate), perfusion (H2(15)O), and autonomic tone (11-C-hydroxyephedrine) should facilitate further understanding of the pathogenesis of the cardiomyopathies. \nComplications following external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer: an analysis of patients treated with and without staging pelvic lymphadenectomy. We reviewed the treatment morbidity associated with definitive high energy external beam radiotherapy in 289 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (stages A2 to C) treated from 1984 to 1988 inclusively. All patients were treated with 18 mv. photon beams via a 4-field box technique. Radiation doses ranged from 5,858 to 6,900 cGy., with a mean dose of 6,456 cGy. and a median dose of 6,400 cGy. A total of 65 patients underwent extraperitoneal pelvic staging lymphadenectomy before radiotherapy. Complications noted in 42 patients were mild (generally trivial) in 23 and moderate in 19 (6.6%). There were no severe complications. The actuarial incidence of moderate complications was 9% at 5 years. Only 6 patients experienced symptoms for longer than 6 months. The risk of complications was not increased in patients who had undergone prior lymph node dissection, and only 2 of 65 had mild lymphedema, which resolved in both cases. We conclude that high energy external beam radiation for prostate cancer can be delivered with a low risk of serious complications, even in patients who have undergone extraperitoneal staging pelvic lymphadenectomy, provided the patients are treated to limited fields with high energy photons and at doses limited to 6,800 cGy. or less. \nFavorable response to parenteral nutrition and medical therapy in Crohn's colitis. A report of 38 patients comparing severe Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. The courses of 38 patients with severe, uncomplicated acute colitis (16 with Crohn's colitis and 22 with ulcerative colitis) were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were placed on total parenteral nutrition and treated concomitantly with corticosteroids, antibiotics (often metronidazole), sulfasalazine, and/or azathioprine. Fifteen of the 16 Crohn's colitis patients were initially managed without surgery. Four patients subsequently relapsed, two responded to reinstituted medical therapy, and two underwent colon resection 2 and 4 years later. Of 22 ulcerative colitis patients, 16 required surgery during the initial hospitalization, one patient subsequently had surgery, and one died after refusing surgery. Three of the other four continue in remission on medical therapy. Thus, there were significant differences in this series between the clinical courses of severe ulcerative colitis and severe Crohn's colitis. While most of the ulcerative colitis patients with severe disease underwent colectomy, most of the patients with severe but uncomplicated Crohn's colitis responded to aggressive medical therapy, of which total parenteral nutrition and perhaps bowel rest seemed to be an important part. Afterwards, the majority remained in remission on long-term medical therapy. \nCombined intertrochanteric and Chiari pelvic osteotomies for hip dysplasia. Thirty-two dysplastic hips with secondary osteoarthritis, in 28 patients aged 18 to 42 years, were treated by combined intertrochanteric and Chiari osteotomy. They were followed up for 2.5 to 10 years. Pain was the main presenting symptom in all the patients. The indication for surgery was based on the severity of disease with respect to congruency, secondary degenerative change and degree of dysplasia. The average pre-operative Harris hip score was 47.7 and the majority had severe dysplasia with degenerative changes. On final review the average score was 88. The radiographic appearances of degenerative arthritis regressed in 72% of hips and dysplasia was improved in all cases. The results of this conservative form of surgery are better in hips with less severe dysplasia and mild secondary degenerative change. \nFamilial aggregation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and other malignancies. A clinicopathologic description. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) occurred in five members in three generations of a white American family of Scandinavian descent. Six other family members had malignancies including malignant melanoma, malignant lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, adenocarcinoma of the colon, and asynchronous bilateral in situ and invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast. There was also a history of autoimmune disorders and exposure to smoke, fumes, and chemicals in some family members. Regression analysis revealed a significant covariate risk for exposure to smoking, alcohol ingestion, dust, salted or spicy foods, and poorly ventilated conditions. According to segregation analysis, the susceptibility to nasopharyngeal carcinoma and other malignancies in this family was transmitted as an autosomal codominant characteristic. A specific histocompatibility antigen (HLA) haplotype of A1-B37-DR6 was associated with a predisposition for NPC, but no linkage was identified. Laboratory studies in selected family members did not reveal significantly elevated levels of Epstein-Barr virus antibodies or serum carcinoembryonic antigen. No specific karyotypic abnormalities were identified with peripheral blood chromosome analysis. This family was an example of apparent autosomal codominant susceptibility to NPC and other malignancies. The relationship of malignancy to the HLA haplotype of A1-B37-DR6, autoimmune disorders, and cytogenetic abnormalities was intriguing but not defined clearly. \nGlial contribution to seizure: carbonic anhydrase activity in epileptic mammalian brain. The activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA), a glial enzyme, was measured in the epileptic cortex of audiogenic DBA/2 mice and of cats with a freeze lesion. In mice, the activity increased with age from birth to 24 days, but were always higher in audiogenic mice than in normal C57/BL mice, reflecting species differences. The difference between the two strains increased sharply from 25 to 40 days of age, after the period of maximal audiogenic susceptibility. Acetazolamide, a CA-specific inhibitor, greatly decreased the seizure severity score of DBA/2 mice after a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration (150 mg/kg). After 24 days of age, when CA activities were high, the effect of acetazolamide was less important, suggesting that the increased cortical CA activity might reflect a protective mechanism. In cats with a freeze lesion, no significant changes in CA activities were observed in the actively discharging primary and secondary foci as compared with the nonepileptogenic perifocal cortex and the control cortex of sham-operated animals. The results indicate that the cortex of genetically susceptible audiogenic mice has an increased CA activity. The hypothesis of an adaptive glial mechanism, relating to the age-dependent decrease of seizure susceptibility in DBA/2 mice, is postulated. \nHilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis. A patient with the limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis is reported. The case is unusual because of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, severe ulceration of the respiratory and digestive tracts, and the rapidly fatal outcome. \nRevascularization of infarcted vs. viable myocardium. Effects on symptoms, physical performance and global/regional left ventricular function. Symptoms, physical performance and global vs. regional left ventricular (LV) function were reviewed in 25 patients with postinfarction anterior-apical akinesia and minor dyskinesia who subsequently underwent revascularization of all graftable stenotic vessels. The observed postoperative improvement in functional NYHA capacity and physical performance was not related to significant change in any systolic or diastolic variable of global LV function. 'Nonspecific postoperative septal hypokinesia' developed in most cases. The regional ejection fraction showed slight (nonsignificant) mean increase in the infarcted apex and low anterior wall supplied by the left anterior descending artery, but marked increase in the noninfarcted lateral wall supplied by the left circumflex branch. Hearts with grafted left circumflex artery showed on average lower preoperative and postoperative ejection fraction in the lateral wall than did hearts without such grafting, but the rise in regional ejection fraction was significant only after left circumflex grafting. The clinical response to coronary artery surgery is attributed mainly to functional improvement of non-infarcted myocardium. Revascularization of viable myocardium occurs directly via bypass grafts, but collateral vessels may also contribute. \nA 2-year experience with the Wolf piezoelectric lithotripter: impact of repeat treatment on results and complications. During a 2-year period, 884 extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy treatments have been performed on stones in 388 renal units (kidney and upper ureter) using a Wolf Piezolith device.* Lithotripsy routinely was performed on an outpatient basis without use of anesthesia or premedication. Often, the maximum number of pulses allowable by a Food and Drug Administration protocol (4,000) was delivered and retreatments frequently occurred on successive days. Of the patients 75% were stone-free 3 months after treatment, while another 20% had only residual small fragments. No intrarenal or perinephric hematomas were observed and only 1 patient has had hypertension requiring medication. Renal colic from passage of stone fragments occurred in only 10% of the patients. An aggressive treatment policy using repeat treatments as necessary provides for superior results with this device without an incision or complication. \nTorticollis in children. Torticollis is a common clinical sign that is found in a variety of disorders. Childhood torticollis differs from the adult form in that congenital types are common and many frequently encountered disorders found in adults are unusual. Pediatric torticollis related to otolaryngologic conditions is reviewed, and three illustrative cases are presented. \nSerum-erythropoietin concentration during acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Reduced oxygen tension is regarded as the primary physiologic signal for the production of erythropoietin (EPO). There is little information available about early changes of EPO production in man due to severe hypoxia. The purpose of the present study was to examine the time course of EPO in serum of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE). In 29 patients (seventy-five +/- six years, mean age +/- SEM) who were hospitalized within two hours after onset of symptoms of ACPE, serum EPO concentrations were monitored for up to seventy-two hours. At the moment of admission all patients showed significantly increased EPO concentrations of 121 +/- 64 mU/mL (mean +/- SEM) compared with a healthy population (15-35 mU/mL). Twenty-three patients who recovered within thirty minutes (group A) exhibited a quick return of their EPO serum levels to normal. The remaining 6 patients (group B) had a protracted clinical course and their EPO concentration showed a further increase up to the end of the observation period. The comparative monitoring of concentrations of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin III, C-reactive protein, fibronectin, hapotoglobin, and transerrin in serum and plasma revealed no significant changes. Thus a major contribution of fluid shifts into or from the intravascular compartment to the observed changes in EPO concentration seems to be unlikely. The data suggest that the production and release of EPO in the kidneys due to altered oxygen delivery is a fast-responding mechanism. \nEffect of surgery on the systemic inflammatory response to intermittent claudication The hypothesis that intermittent claudication initiates a systemic inflammatory response was investigated by studying the effect of exercise on markers of neutrophil activation and vascular permeability in 25 claudicants and 10 controls. Urinary albumin excretion, previously demonstrated to reflect vascular permeability, increased significantly after exercise in claudicants and was associated with decreased neutrophil filterability and increased serum lysozyme activity. No similar exercise-induced changes were seen in controls or in claudicants after successful arterial bypass surgery. These results suggest that intermittent claudication is associated with potentially deleterious systemic manifestations that are surgically reversible. \nTemporal arteritis: an at",
