        "text": "s in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) II-B Study In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Phase II trial, patients received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and were randomized to either a conservative or an invasive strategy. Within this study, the effects of immediate versus deferred beta-blocker therapy were also assessed in patients eligible for beta-blocker therapy, a group of 1,434 patients of which 720 were randomized to the immediate intravenous group and 714 to the deferred group. In the immediate intravenous group, within 2 hours of initiating rt-PA metoprolol was given (5 mg intravenously at 2-minute intervals over 6 minutes, for a total intravenous dose of 15 mg, followed by 50 mg orally every 12 hours in the first 24 hours and 100 mg orally every 12 hours thereafter). The patients assigned to the deferred group received metoprolol, 50 mg orally twice on day 6, followed by 100 mg orally twice a day thereafter. The therapy was tolerated well in both groups and the primary end point, resting global ejection fraction at hospital discharge, averaged 50.5% and was virtually identical in the two groups. The regional ventricular function was also similar in the two groups. Overall, there was no difference in mortality between the immediate intravenous and deferred groups, but in the subgroup defined as low risk there were no deaths at 6 weeks among those receiving immediate beta-blocker therapy in contrast to seven deaths among those in whom beta-blocker therapy was deferred. These findings for a secondary end point in a subgroup were not considered sufficient to warrant a recommendation regarding clinical use. There was a lower incidence of reinfarction (2.7% versus 5.1%, p = 0.02) and recurrent chest pain (18.8% versus 24.1%, p less than 0.02) at 6 days in the immediate intravenous group. Thus, in appropriate postinfarction patients, beta-blockers are safe when given early after thrombolytic therapy and are associated with decreased myocardial ischemia and reinfarction in the first week but offer no benefit over late administration in improving ventricular function or reducing mortality. \nThoracic epidural analgesia in a patient with bilateral phaeochromocytoma undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A patient suffering from phaeochromocytoma and coronary artery stenoses needed coronary artery bypass grafting before adrenalectomy. High thoracic epidural analgesia (T1-T2) with bupivacaine and sufentanil in combination with general anaesthesia was used. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations decreased during the period before bypass grafting compared to the baseline value and no important haemodynamic changes were seen during this period. Thoracic epidural analgesia failed to suppress the release of catecholamine during the bypass period. After the operation, the plasma catecholamine concentrations returned to the baseline value. Excellent analgesia (visual analogue scale = 1-2) was achieved with a postoperative epidural, but the plasma catecholamine concentration increased considerably. \nThe significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B. We assessed the prevalence and clinical significance of antibodies to hepatitis C virus among a cohort of 148 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Sixteen patients (11%) had anti-hepatitis C virus detectable by enzyme-linked immunoassay. The results from eight of these patients were positive by recombinant immunoblot assay. The results of recombinant immunoblot assay testing were not consistent; therefore the analysis of the patients' data was based on anti-hepatitis C virus enzyme-linked immunoassay results. Patients with chronic hepatitis B with anti-hepatitis C virus were more likely to be cirrhotic (44% vs. 21%) and to have decompensated liver disease (24% vs. 6%). Hepatitis B virus replication appeared to be suppressed in patients with both infections as measured by hepatitis B virus-associated DNA polymerase activity (mean = 2,055 vs. 2,555 cpm). Human immunodeficiency virus infection was more common in the anti-hepatitis C virus positive group (36% vs. 11%). Thus hepatitis C virus appears to suppress hepatitis B virus replication and to cause more severe liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. \nAmiodarone inhibits the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and produces microvesicular steatosis of the liver in mice. Amiodarone has been shown to produce microvesicular steatosis of the liver in some recipients. We have determined the effects of amiodarone on the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in mice. In vitro, the formation of 14C-acid-soluble beta-oxidation products from [U-14C]palmitic acid by mouse liver mitochondria was decreased by 92% in the presence of 125 microM amiodarone and by 94% in the presence of 125 microM N-desethylamiodarone. Inhibition due to 100 or 150 microM amiodarone persisted in the presence of 5 mM acetoacetate, whereas acetoacetate totally relieved inhibition due to 15 microM rotenone. In vivo, exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [U-14C]palmitic acid was decreased by 31, 40, 58 and 78%, respectively, in mice receiving 19, 25, 50 and 100 mg.kg-1 of amiodarone hydrochloride 1 hr before the administration of [U-14C]palmitic acid. One hour after 100 mg.kg-1, the exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]palmitic acid, [1-14C]octanoic acid or [1-14C]butyric acid was decreased by 78, 72 and 53%, respectively. Exhalation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]palmitic acid was normal between 6 and 9 hr after administration of 100 mg.kg-1 of amiodarone hydrochloride, but was still inhibited by 71 and 37%, 24 and 48 hr after 600 mg.kg-1. Twenty four hours after the latter dose of amiodarone, hepatic triglycerides were increased by 150%, and there was microvesicular steatosis of the liver. We conclude that amiodarone inhibits the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and produces microvesicular steatosis of the liver in mice. \nDNA analysis of atrial myxomas. The atrial myxoma is a primary tumor of the heart which may have an uncertain clinical course. In this study, we performed flow cytometric DNA analysis of 15 paraffin-embedded atrial myxomas and correlated DNA ploidy status and proliferative fraction with clinical findings. Twelve of 15 cases (80 percent) were diploid and the remaining three cases (20 percent) were aneuploid. Two patients with aneuploid histograms were free of tumor at the time follow-up; the third patient experienced local tumor recurrence and metastases. Five patients with diploid myxomas demonstrated an elevated (greater than or equal to 17 percent) proliferative cell cycle fraction; four of these patients experienced embolic phenomenon or tumor recurrence. This pilot study suggests that an atrial myxoma with either aneuploid DNA content or elevated proliferative fraction may be associated with aggressive biologic behavior. \nAssessment of the psychological impact of a breast screening programme. In order to assess the psychological effect of mammographic screening, questionnaires (which included psychometric tests) were sent to 750 women at invitation and, 6 weeks after screening, to 420 women normal after the first mammograph, to 240 women normal after special assessment, and to 68 women normal after open biopsy. Increasing degree of the investigation was associated both with increasing frequency of breast self examination (10% were practising breast self-examination at least once a week before screening compared with 24% for women after special assessment and 35% of women who had had an open biopsy (p less than 0.001)), and with greater confidence that any malignancy in the breast would have been found. Psychometric scores showed no increase of general levels of anxiety or depression in the screened groups. For anxiety, percentages abnormal were 5, 4, 2 and 6 for the four groups, respectively, and for depression the percentages abnormal were 5, 4, 4 and 6, respectively; 10% of screened women were more anxious about having breast cancer as a result of the screening. At least 10% of women proceeding to open biopsy of benign lesions require professional counselling and support. Psychological ill effects were not detected by the psychometric test among women who did not proceed to this final investigation. Behavioural changes did suggest a raised awareness or fear of potential cancer among the screened population. \nNeurologic outcome after electroencephalographically proven neonatal seizures. Infants in whom neonatal seizures were confirmed by randomly recorded ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) tracings were retrospectively examined to determine their global neurologic outcome and the specific frequency of epilepsy, development delay, and cerebral palsy. Perinatal and postnatal clinical and EEG variables were also examined for their relevance to the neurologic outcome. Forty infants with EEG documented seizures of diverse etiologies were studied. The 27 survivors were followed up at a mean of 31 months. The outcome was unfavorable in 70%. The rate of epilepsy was 56%, of developmental delay 67%, and of cerebral palsy 63%. The etiology of seizures was an important factor influencing the outcome. Other clinical factors that showed a significant relationship with global or specific aspects of the neurologic outcome included the age at the onset of seizures, birth weight, and neurologic examination results. The EEG parameters that significantly predicted the neurologic outcome were interictal EEG background, increased seizure frequency, and decreased seizure duration. \nSudden cardiac death: management of high-risk patients Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 350,000 deaths each year, and the survival rate of victims remains low. Most survivors face a significant risk for recurrence. The typical substrate is chronic--abnormal myocardium with fibrosis (often from previous myocardial infarction) and left ventricular dysfunction. Acute triggers for sudden cardiac death are primarily electrical, ischemic, metabolic, neurohormonal, and pharmacologic. In most electrocardiographically documented cases of sudden cardiac death, the trigger-substrate interaction appears to result in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. After initial resuscitation, survivors need a thorough cardiovascular evaluation, including definition of coronary anatomy, left ventricular function, and wall-motion abnormalities, as well as an electrophysiologic evaluation. An attempt must be made to determine what each survivor's correctable triggers are. Management should address all reversible triggers, such as acute ischemia and electrolyte abnormalities, and should include modifying or correcting the arrhythmogenic substrate. Empiric antiarrhythmic therapy offers no advantage in such modification. Pharmacologic therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs should be guided by an objective therapeutic endpoint, which is best accomplished through the use of programmed ventricular stimulation and serial electrophysiologic studies. Other therapeutic options include surgical suppression of ventricular tachycardia and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator. \nSerum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: relation to liver fibrosis and arthritis. Levels of serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen were measured in 170 patients with psoriasis (49% with coexistent psoriatic arthritis) who had liver biopsies performed during or before treatment with methotrexate or, in some cases, with retinoids. Psoriasis patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis in their liver biopsy specimens had a significantly higher mean serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen than did patients without fibrosis and without arthritis. Only 4% of patients without cirrhosis or fibrosis and no arthritis had an elevated serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen. In contrast, 38% of patients with psoriatic arthritis had an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of detectable liver fibrosis. It is concluded that the number of liver biopsies performed on methotrexate-treated psoriasis patients with or without arthritis may be reduced to a minimum as long as serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen is normal. Increased serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of arthritis is a strong indicator of liver fibrogenesis and suggests the need for liver biopsy to monitor possible methotrexate-induced toxicity. In patients with psoriatic arthritis an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen may be related to the joint disease. Patients with psoriatic arthritis and increased levels of aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen should therefore follow the established guidelines for the use of methotrexate in psoriasis. \nDelayed sleep phase syndrome response to melatonin. The actions of melatonin on the sleep-wake cycle were investigated by means of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 8 subjects with a delayed sleep phase syndrome attending a sleep disorders clinic. In randomised order the subjects received placebo or melatonin 5 mg daily for 4 weeks with a 1 week washout period between the treatments. Drug or placebo was given at 2200 h, 5 h before the mean time of sleep onset determined by pretrial sleep logs. In all 8 subjects sleep onset time (mean advance 82 [range 19-124] min; p less than 0.01) and wake time (117 [10-187] min; p less than 0.01) were significantly earlier during melatonin treatment than during placebo. Mean total sleep time was slightly less on melatonin (8 h 12 min) than on placebo (8 h 46 min). Alertness acrophase calculated from the subjects' ratings of alertness made every 2 h while awake was unaltered. Melatonin may act as a phase-setter for sleep-wake cycles in subjects with a delayed sleep phase syndrome. \nOverseas fatalities of United States citizen travelers: an analysis of deaths related to international travel. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Studies of travel-related mortality and morbidity have been limited to nonfatal events. Causes of travel-related mortality may differ significantly from morbidity and thus have different prevention strategies. DESIGN: We examined the overseas fatalities of US citizen travelers for the years 1975 and 1984. The death certificates were abstracted; all deaths under age 60 and a 20% sample of deaths 60 and older were examined. SETTING AND TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All overseas travel fatalities of US citizens were examined excluding those occurring in Canada. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents) and injuries accounted for 49% and 25% of the overseas deaths of US citizen travelers, respectively. Infectious diseases other than pneumonia accounted for only 1% of the deaths. Eighty percent of injury deaths occurred outside of hospitals. Injury death rates for male travelers were greater than US age-specific death rates. CONCLUSIONS: Greater emphasis on the prevention of fatal events, especially those resulting from injury, must be given by physicians and other individuals and organizations who advise travelers. Further studies are needed to explore the issues of preventable injury deaths, emergency medical services, and overseas travel. \nTwenty-four-hour blood pressure control with isradipine in mild essential hypertension. The hypotensive effect of isradipine was assessed in 26 male patients, aged 40 to 64 years, with hypertension. After withdrawal of previous antihypertensive treatment and a four-week placebo period, patients were randomized into a double-blind active-treatment period of eight weeks to receive either placebo or 1.25 to 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured by Accutracker (Suntech, Oxford, England) after the placebo period and at the end of the active-treatment period. In the isradipine group n = 13), both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and number of blood pressure spikes decreased significantly (P less than .0001), whereas there was a significant increase of these variables in the placebo control group (n = 13). The results of this study indicate that, in these subjects, blood pressure control was achieved throughout the 24-h period by monotherapy with isradipine. \nDamage to tissue defenses by EMLA cream. EMLA is a new topical agent that safely anesthetizes intact skin. The purpose of this study was to determine if this cream could be safely used for anesthetizing wounds. This investigation evaluated the potential toxicity of EMLA cream in wounds by measuring its effect on host defenses and on the biology of wound repair. In contaminated wounds, EMLA cream elicited an exaggerated inflammatory response that damaged host defenses, inviting the development of infection. As a result of these investigations, we do not recommend the use of EMLA cream in wounds. \nCarotid cavernous fistula after minimal facial trauma. Report of a case. The carotid cavernous fistula has historically been associated with extensive facial trauma as a result of direct or indirect forces. Most fistulas of traumatic origin develop as a result of a fracture through the base of the skull, which produces a force causing laceration of the internal carotid artery in the region where it approximates the cavernous sinus. We report a case in which apparently minimal head trauma resulted in the development of a carotid cavernous fistula. The rather innocuous presentation of this complication requires particular attention by the caregiver in assessing the patient sustaining maxillofacial trauma. \nEthnic differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales. OBJECTIVE--To examine mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in England and Wales by country of birth of the deceased. DESIGN--Standardised mortality ratios were computed by country of birth groups for ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease for 1979-83 and 1970-2 by using the five year age-sex specific rates for England and Wales for 1979-83 as standard. SETTING--England and Wales 1970-2 and 1979-83. RESULTS--In 1979-83 mortality from ischaemic heart disease was highest in men and women born in the Indian subcontinent (standardised mortality ratio 136 and 146 respectively). Young Indian men suffered the greatest excess (313 at ages 20-29). Other groups with raised mortality included Irish, Scottish, and Polish born immigrants. Those born in the Caribbean, the old Commonwealth, west Europe, and the United States had low death rates. In England and Wales mortality from ischaemic heart disease declined by 5% in men and 1% in women between 1970-2 and 1979-83, with greatest percentage declines in immigrants born in the United States, South Africa, the old Commonwealth, the Caribbean, and France. immigrant groups with raised mortality in the earlier period showed little improvement, and mortality from ischaemic heart disease increased among Indians (6% in men and 13% in women). In 1979-83 mortality from cerebrovascular disease was highest in Caribbeans (standardised mortality ratios 176 in men and 210 in women), followed by Africans, Indians, and Irish. Rates were low in west Europeans. Mortality from stroke declined by 28% overall in this period, a rate of decline shared by most groups. Men from the Indian subcontinent showed a decline of only 3%. CONCLUSION--In the 1980s mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease differed significantly between ethnic groups in England and Wales. In general, ethnic groups that experienced lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease in the 1970s showed the greatest improvement over the following decade. \nEffect of exercise supplementation on dipyridamole thallium-201 image quality To determine the effect of different types of exercise supplementation on dipyridamole thallium image quality, 78 patients were prospectively randomized to one of three protocols: dipyridamole infusion alone, dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip, and dipyridamole with low-level treadmill exercise. Heart-to-lung, heart-to-liver, and heart-to-adjacent infradiaphragmatic activity ratios were generated from anterior images acquired immediately following the test. Additionally, heart-to-total infradiaphragmatic activity was graded semiquantitatively. Results showed a significantly higher ratio of heart to subdiaphragmatic activity in the treadmill group as compared with dipyridamole alone (p less than 0.001) and dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip exercise (p less than 0.001). No significant difference was observed between patients receiving the dipyridamole infusion, and dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip exercise. We conclude that low-level treadmill exercise supplementation of dipyridamole infusion is an effective means of improving image quality. Supplementation with isometric handgrip does not improve image quality over dipyridamole alone. \nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a patient with a cadaveric dural graft. We report a 26-year-old woman with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) who had received cadaveric dural material 33 months before the onset of neurologic symptoms. This is the fourth case in which a dural graft was the putative source of the CJD agent. All four cases had the grafting before changes in the sterilization procedure adopted in 1987 to inactivate the CJD agent. \nMammographic follow-up of nonpalpable low-suspicion breast abnormalities: one versus two views. A retrospective study involving 498 women with a total of 666 breast lesions was undertaken to determine the relative efficacy of one- and two-view mammography in the follow-up evaluation of \"low-suspicion\" abnormal mammographic findings. These abnormalities consisted of well-defined masses (47.1%), well-defined punctate microcalcifications (20.9%), and parenchymal asymmetry (32.0%). Confidence in the adequacy of the single-view follow-up was high in 91% of cases. The addition of the second mammographic view changed the one-view interpretation in approximately 1% of all cases. Two cancers were detected during the initial follow-up period. Both cancers were detected with single-view and standard two-view follow-up examinations, with high confidence. In this controlled retrospective study, the single-view follow-up examination was adequate for follow-up of most low-suspicion mammographic abnormalities. Monitoring by physicians, however, would be necessary to prevent an unacceptable number of patient recalls, which could make the one-view follow-up study impractical to use in some practices. \nThe \"two week syndrome\" associated with injection treatment for chronic pain--fact or fiction? Many patients attending the pain clinic for regular injections of local anaesthetic state that the pain returned \"two weeks\" ago. This study demonstrates that 85% of these patients have a \"return of pain\" interval which coincides with the proximity of their next clinic appointment. \nCholedochal cyst and biliary atresia in the neonate: imaging findings in five cases. The radiologic findings in five neonates with choledochal cyst associated with extra-hepatic biliary atresia are described. All five patients (age range, 13-72 days) presented with jaundice and acholic stools. In all four patients who underwent sonographic examination, a cystic structure separate from the gallbladder representing the choledochal cyst was shown. The diagnosis of atresia of the distal common bile duct was made preoperatively in all cases by hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and was demonstrated by intraoperative cholangiography in four cases. All patients were successfully treated with surgical intervention within 1 month from the time of diagnosis. Early detection of this rare disorder, which may be distinct from choledochal cyst found in children and adults, is important to prevent fatal complications of biliary obstruction. The combined use of sonography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy can correctly identify this subset of patients with persistent neonatal jaundice and provide valuable information for prompt surgical management. \nRegional changes in hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size in rats with aortocaval fistulas. 1. Developing and established hypertrophy. The effects of a large arteriovenous fistula on left and right ventricular hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size were examined in adult rats at 1 week and 1 month after surgery. Cardiac output, left ventricular function, and right ventricular function were evaluated before obtaining isolated myocytes for cell size measurements. Average heart weight increased 35% at 1 week and 86% at 1 month in rats with fistulas. In general, myocyte hypertrophy was due to a proportional increase in length and width (length/width ratio remained constant). This change was more evident in the large hearts from rats with 1-month fistulas. At both the 1-week and 1-month intervals, the hypertrophic response of right ventricular myocytes was slightly greater than that observed in the left ventricle or interventricular septum. Left ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dtmax were significantly reduced at 1 week but returned to normal after 1 month of overloading. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased approximately fivefold and twofold at 1 week and 1 month, respectively. Right ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dtmax were increased at both intervals examined. We conclude that severe volume overloading from a large aortocaval fistula in the rat is characterized by 1) depressed left ventricular function at 1 week followed by a large compensatory hypertrophy and near normal function at 1 month, 2) right ventricular pressure overload, and 3) changes in myocyte shape that resemble normal physiological growth. \nInitial clinical trial of EXOSURF, a protein-free synthetic surfactant, for the prophylaxis and early treatment of hyaline membrane disease. EXOSURF is a protein-free surfactant composed of 85% dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 9% hexadecanol, and 6% tyloxapol by weight. A single dose of 5 mL of EXOSURF per kilogram body weight, which gave 67 mg of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine per kilogram body weight, or 5 mL/kg air was given intratracheally in each of two controlled trials: at birth to neonates 700 through 1350 g (the prophylactic trial, n = 74) or at 4 to 24 hours after birth to neonates greater than 650 g who had hyaline membrane disease severe enough to require mechanical ventilation (the rescue trial, n = 104). In both studies, time-averaged inspired oxygen concentrations and mean airway pressures during the 72 hours after entry decreased significantly (P less than .05) in the treated neonates when compared with control neonates. Thirty-six percent of the treated neonates in the rescue study had an incomplete response to treatment or relapsed within 24 hours, suggesting the need for retreatment in some neonates. In the rescue trial, risk-adjusted survival increased significantly in the treated group. There were no significant differences in intracranial hemorrhages, chronic lung disease, or symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus between control and treated infants in either trial. \n\"Heartstart Scotland\"--initial experience of a national scheme for out of hospital defibrillation. OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome of out of hospital defibrillation in Scotland during the year after the introduction of automated external defibrillators in October 1988. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of ambulance service reports and hospital records. SETTING--Scottish Ambulance Service and acute receiving hospitals throughout Scotland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Delay from cardiac arrest to first defibrillator shock; vital state on arrival at hospital accident and emergency department; survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS--During the study period 268 defibrillators were purchased by public subscription and 96% of the 2000 ambulance crew underwent an eight hour training programme in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. A total of 1111 cardiac arrests were recorded, and defibrillation was indicated and undertaken in 602 (54%) patients, mean age 63 (range 14-92) years. A spontaneous pulse was present on arrival at hospital in 180 (30%) of the defibrillated patients, and 75 (12.5%) were subsequently discharged alive. As expected, the likelihood of survival was inversely related to the delay from the onset of cardiac arrest to the time of the first shock and was greater in the case of witnessed arrest. If ventricular fibrillation occurred after the arrival of the ambulance, survival to discharge was 33%. CONCLUSIONS--An effective scheme for out of hospital defibrillation can be introduced rapidly, and with limited training implications and costs, by the use of automated external defibrillators in ambulances. \nColonic ischemia complicating immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha. Colonic ischemia (CI) is a rare complication of high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy. This complication occurred in three of 141 patients (2.1%) with metastatic cancer treated with high-dose IL-2 therapy; CI only developed in patients receiving interferon-alpha (IFN) with IL-2 (three of 21, 14%) compared with none of 120 in those patients receiving IL-2 alone (P equals 0.0009). Severe diarrhea (greater than or equal to 7 bowel movements/day) also was significantly more common in patients receiving IFN with IL-2 (six of 21, 29%) than in those receiving IL-2 alone (three of 120, 2.5%, P equals 0.001) and preceded the clinical diagnosis of CI in all three patients. Three of nine patients with severe diarrhea had CI. Hematochezia occurred in four patients, all of whom received IFN with IL-2; three had CI, and the other patient had nonspecific colitis. Differences in vasopressor use did not explain the increased risk of CI in patients receiving IFN; those receiving IFN with IL-2 required phenylephrine less often than patients receiving IL-2 alone (P equals 0.01). The administration of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells had no significant effect on the incidence of CI, severe diarrhea, peritonitis, or vasopressor use; two of three patients with CI, however, had their ischemic episode within 24 hours after the last of three LAK cell infusions. In conclusion, CI is an unusual complication of high-dose IL-2 and IFN immunotherapy. In patients receiving such combination therapy, severe diarrhea is a risk factor for the subsequent occurrence of CI. \nCarcinoma of the pancreas: a personal experience with 100 cases. One hundred patients with pancreatic cancer were evaluated between March 1981 and December 1989. This study showed that 61 were not candidates for definitive surgery because of nonoperability (28 patients) or nonresectability (33 patients). An additional 25 patients had cancers that were unresectable because of metastases (13 patients) or local spread of disease (12 patients) discovered at laparotomy. Fourteen patients had resectable cancers. Ten were treated by total pancreatectomy, three by distal pancreatectomy and one by pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple). There were two operative mortalities. The median patient survival time was 20.5 months. Two patients survived 5 years. Five patients are alive at 3, 14, 18, and 47 months. Palliative surgical procedures performed in 18 patients included 10 biliary bypasses, 9 gastrojejunostomies, and 6 T-tube placements. This was associated with an operative mortality rate of 11%. The median survival time was 5 months. Other palliative measures included endoscopic placement of biliary and pancreatic stents (47 patients, 2.7% mortality rate), endoluminal radiation therapy, interstitial radiation therapy and external beam radiation therapy. The median survival time of patients so treated was 4.5 months. \nSuccessful medical treatment of presumed Candida endocarditis in critically ill infants. Few infants have been reported who survived fungal endocarditis; all have required both surgical and intensive antifungal therapy. We describe three infants, two weighing less than 1000 gm, who survived Candida endocarditis without surgery. Two had Candida parapsilosis, an agent not previously reported as a cause of neonatal endocarditis. All three infants were treated with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. Despite administration of 44, 38, and 48 mg/kg amphotericin B, respectively, no nephrotoxicity was noted; 5-flucytosine therapy was stopped in one infant because of thrombocytopenia. One infant died of an unrelated cause 6 months later; there was no evidence of Candida or endocarditis at autopsy. The other two infants are thriving 2 and 3 years after the completion of antifungal therapy; no remaining evidence of endocarditis is present on echocardiography. We conclude that antifungal therapy without surgery is an option for Candida endocarditis in critically ill infants. \nClinical correlates of abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension. Sixty-five patients with esophageal complaints were studied to determine clinical associations with abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension (esophageal sensory dysfunction). Associations were examined in four categories: motility, esophageal symptoms, recent psychological symptoms, and general clinical features. A positive response to balloon distension (pain with less than or equal to 8 ml volume) was found in 29 (45%) of the subjects. This response was associated with specific findings in each category except recent psychological symptoms. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that an increased frequency of multipeaked waves on motility testing, presence of dysphagia, and shorter height of the subject each had an independent association with positive response to balloon distension (P less than or equal to 0.05 for each). Further comparison of subjects with sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or both (sensorimotor dysfunction) indicated that subjects with the combined disorder appeared more symptomatic than those with either finding alone. These observations indicate that: (1) esophageal motor and sensory dysfunction are partially associated, but both contribute to the symptomatic state; (2) dysphagia may be representative of sensory dysfunction in some cases; and (3) subject height should be taken into consideration when interpreting balloon distension results. \nSmoking, the oral contraceptive pill, and Crohn's disease. Both cigarette smoking and the oral contraceptive pill have been implicated as aggravating factors in Crohn's disease. Based upon the recent demonstration of multifocal gastrointestinal infarction in Crohn's disease, a possible pathogenic mechanism for this condition, we propose how smoking and the oral contraceptive pill may potentiate a tendency for focal thrombosis and hence exacerbate the activity of Crohn's disease. \nLong-term therapy of HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma with recombinant interferon alpha-2a. Five young male patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) were treated with recombinant interferon alpha 2a (rIFN-alpha-2a) over a period of 2-2.5 years. An IFN dose of 18 x 10(6) IU was given subcutaneously every day during the first 3 months of treatment and then on alternate days. Additional treatment with radiotherapy and laser therapy was given and, in some cases, isolated skin nodules were excised. Within 7 months of initiation of therapy one patient had a complete remission of his tumours, however, tumour progression recurred after the patient discontinued treatment. In another patient the tumour cleared within 9 months of rIFN therapy, and after 52 months he is still free of KS. The condition of a third patient tended to become stabilized during the first 6 months of therapy, but after 60 months there has been a slow progression. The fourth and fifth patients died 25 and 28 months, respectively, after the histological diagnosis of KS and the initiation of treatment. While on therapy with rIFN-alpha-2a, no life-threatening opportunistic infections occurred. The side-effects were mostly well tolerated, and no severe changes in haematological parameters were caused by the therapy. \nValue of dual-energy CT in differentiating focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density masses. Focal (irregular, partial) fatty infiltration of the liver may simulate neoplastic or other hypodense masses on CT. On the basis of previous observations of the phenomenon that differences in X-ray attenuation diminish with increasing energy of X-rays used, we performed a preliminary study to determine if dual-energy CT could be used to discriminate between fatty infiltration and hypodense liver masses. Dual-energy CT at 140 and 80 kVp was performed in 14 patients undergoing liver biopsy and in seven control subjects with presumedly normal liver. Attenuation measurements were taken, and the changes in attenuation between 140 and 80 kVp were calculated. The mean changes in attenuation were 3.5 H for normal liver (n = 7), 2.5 H for hypodense liver masses (n = 6), 13 H for fatty liver (n = 5), 0.3 H for fatty liver combined with hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis (n = 3), and 2 H for the spleen (n = 18). The change in attenuation increased as the fat content in the liver increased. Analysis of variance showed a statistically significant difference (p less than .001) between fatty liver and the other groups. A difference greater than 10 H was unique to fatty infiltration. These results suggest that dual-energy CT may help to differentiate focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density neoplastic or other lesions, but only if the iron content of the liver is not increased. \nAbnormal expression of histocompatibility and mitochondrial antigens by cardiac tissue from patients with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Autoantibodies against the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex proteins, and myosin have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Cardiac tissue from patients with DCM and, for control purposes, cardiac tissue from patients with other forms of cardiomyopathy and from patients with no history of cardiac disease were stained with heterologous and ANT-, BCKD-, and myosin-specific affinity-purified sera from DCM patients. Data demonstrate that although anti-myosin stains tissues from both patients and normal controls, the ANT- and BCKD-specific heterologous and affinity-purified sera from DCM patients stain only cardiac tissues from DCM patients. Intense staining in patchy areas of cardiac tissue suggests that abnormal increased expression of these putative autoantigens occurs in discrete areas of cardiac myocytes. The reactivity of the antisera was organ specific and only seen in tissues from DCM patients. The organ and disease specificity of these findings suggests that such expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human DCM. \nNifedipine reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction and transient ischemia in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting. A randomized study was performed on 104 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting to examine whether the infusion of nifedipine (n = 53) reduces the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and necrosis in the early postoperative period. Continuous hemodynamic and three-channel Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours and serial assessment of serum enzymes and 12-lead electrocardiography were performed for 36 hours postoperatively. Nifedipine (minimum dose, 10 micrograms/kg/hr for 24 hours) was applied from the onset of extracorporal circulation. The control group (n = 51) received nitroglycerin (minimum dose, 1 micrograms/kg/min for 24 hours). Using the combined analyses of electrocardiography and Holter recordings, myocardial ischemia was defined as being either a transient ischemic event (TIE), transient coronary spasm (TCS), or myocardial infarction (MI). The two groups did not differ with respect to preoperative New York Heart Association classification, age, history of myocardial infarction, extracorporal circulation and aortic cross-clamp time, number of distal anastomoses, or systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. The incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia was substantially lower in the nifedipine than in the nitroglycerin group [TIE: three of 53 patients (6%) versus nine of 50 patients (18%), p less than 0.001; MI: two of 53 patients (4%) versus six of 50 patients (12%), p less than 0.001; and TCS: none of 53 patients (0%) versus two of 50 patients (4%), p = NS]. \nPrevention of stroke and brain damage with calcium antagonists in animals. In a rat model of embolic stroke (permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery [MCAO]), various 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have been shown to attenuate brain damage and the resultant functional impairment when administered after MCAO. Dose-response curves reveal that isradipine is one of the most potent and efficacious representatives of this class of compounds, reducing the infarct size by more than 60%. These results suggest that isradipine, when administered shortly after stroke onset, may have beneficial effects in patients suffering from brain ischemia. When isradipine is used to normalize the high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, it will, in addition, also protect the brain from damage engendered by a subsequent stroke. This is not the case if blood pressure is controlled with a calcium antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting that the brain protection seen with isradipine is not due to blood pressure normalization. Isradipine, when used as an antihypertensive, appears to have an additional beneficial effect within the brain itself. As high blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke, such an additional benefit with isradipine would be particularly valuable in antihypertensive therapy. \nThe relationship between large airway inflammation and airway metaplasia. To assess the role of acute inflammatory cells in large airways in the pathogenesis of metaplasia, we performed BAL (divided into aliquots) and mucosal biopsies on asbestos workers. They had evidence of asbestos-related lung injury. We found that acute inflammatory cells were significantly increased in the first aliquot. Ex-smokers had a greater percentage of PMN compared with nonsmokers and current smokers. The subjects were subgrouped with respect to biopsy-detected metaplasia. There was no difference between these groups for percentage or total number of PMN in the first aliquot. However, subjects with metaplasia had significant reduction in FEV1/FVC compared with those without. We conclude that there are significant differences in cells between the first and subsequent aliquots. Although inflammatory stimuli may be important in the pathogenesis of metaplasia, PMN present in the first aliquot could not be related to the severity of the metaplastic changes in these workers. \nRisks of leaving the gallbladder in situ after endoscopic sphincterotomy for bile duct stones. There is controversy concerning the subsequent clinical course of patients whose gallbladder is left in situ following successful endoscopic removal of stones from their common bile ducts. A total of 191 patients (median age 76 years) were reviewed between 12 and 100 months (mean 38 months) after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Ten patients (5.2 per cent) had symptoms requiring cholecystectomy which was uneventful, nine in the first year. Cholangitis at presentation or failure to fill the gallbladder by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were not helpful in identifying these patients. Forty-nine (25.6 per cent) patients died during the review period from non-biliary pathology (usually cardiovascular). Elective cholecystectomy is not required in elderly patients with symptomatic bile duct stones if the common bile duct can be cleared of stones after endoscopic sphincterotomy. \nCarcinoma of the cervix treated with radiation therapy. I. A multi-variate analysis of prognostic variables in the Gynecologic Oncology Group. Between 1977 and 1985, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) conducted three clinical trials in locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix, clinical Stages I to IVA as classified by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). All 626 patients had primary carcinoma of the cervix and underwent operative assessment of the para-aortic (PA) lymph nodes. Patients received standardized external radiation therapy to the pelvis or to the pelvis and PA lymph nodes followed by one or two brachytherapy applications. To date, no statistically significant differences in progression-free interval (PFI) or survival time have been identified between the randomization treatment arms on any of these studies. Basic similarities among these studies led us to pool these data to identify patient characteristics and tumor characteristics associated with an increased risk of treatment failure. Multi-variate analysis showed patient age, performance status (PS), PA lymph node status, tumor size, and pelvic node status to be significantly associated with PFI. When modeling for survival, all these factors and clinical stage and bilateral extension were significant. \nIntrahepatic spontaneous arterioportal fistula: duplex ultrasound diagnosis and angiographic treatment. A 54-yr-old male with portal hypertension received ineffective medical therapy for the diagnosis of portal hepatic cirrhosis. Duplex ultrasound (US) revealed pulsatile arterial flow in the right main portal vein. The correct diagnosis of intrahepatic arterioportal fistula was established and confirmed by angiography. Right hepatic artery embolization with three coils was performed. The patient is alive for 16 months after the embolization, and his complaints have disappeared. There has been full resorption of ascites and absence of varices. Nine previously reported similar cases are reviewed. \nTransvaginal sonographic follow-up on the formation of fetal cephalocele at 13-19 weeks' gestation. An occipital meningocele was detected by transvaginal sonography in a fetus of 13 weeks' gestation. This changed at 14 weeks to a cephalocele, which disappeared at 15-16 weeks and was detected again at 19 weeks. It is possible that sliding backward and forward of the herniated brain tissue caused this sequence of events. \nRespiratory problems in emergence from anesthesia. In conclusion, anesthesia and mechanical ventilation have major effects on respiratory function, both intraoperatively and postoperatively. Recognition that mechanical ventilation represents a major departure from spontaneous ventilation should enable anesthesiologists to compensate for the increases in dead space ventilation and the propensity for alveolar collapse that accompany low volume mechanical ventilation. The use of postoperative regional analgesic techniques to alleviate respiratory compromise constitutes both current clinical practice and an area of active, ongoing investigation. Gone are the days when the anesthesiologist's responsibility stopped at the recovery room door. Today, anesthesiologists with expertise in postoperative pain management, cardiovascular physiology, and intensive ventilatory care are able to provide patients an improved likelihood of avoiding postoperative respiratory complications. \nRed cell deformability is an early indicator of infection. Red blood cells (RBC) have been shown to become less deformable during infection. The RBC deformability index (DI) was measured within 24 hours of admission in 37 patients who had suffered trauma and every 48 to 72 hours thereafter while they were in the surgical intensive care unit to assess whether DI could be used as an early indicator of infection after injury. Infection was defined as a temperature of 101 degrees F or more and a white blood cell count of more than 12,000/cm3 associated with a positive culture. Eighteen patients developed an infection, and 19 patients did not. On day 1, both groups showed a significant decrease in DI, compared to controls (0.33 +/- 0.18 and 0.34 +/- 0.25 for patients with infection and patients with no infection vs 1.52 +/- 0.12 for control volunteers; p less than 0.05). In the group with no infection, the DI improved in 16 of 19 patients after injury; the DI in patients with infection continued to decrease in 17 of 18 patients. The decrease in DI occurred 4 +/- 2 days (range, 2 to 8 days) before the diagnosis of infection. No significant differences were apparent in the absolute white blood cell count between the group with infection and the group with no infection at any time after injury. Differences in maximal temperature were noted on day 3 and beyond; however, 30% of patients with no infection had a temperature of more than 101 degrees F for 7 days. These data show that trauma results in a significant decrease in RBC deformability and that serial changes in DI appeared to predict which patients would develop an infection and which patients would recover uneventfully. RBC deformability may be helpful in early detection of infection in patients who have suffered trauma. \nSensitivity of the gastric mucosa to acid and duodenal contents in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia. Nonulcer dyspepsia is a common clinical syndrome whose etiology is unknown. The sensitivity of the gastric mucosa to acid and duodenal contents in 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia was studied. The patients had a normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy specimens were obtained for determination of Helicobacter pylori status. Fifteen of the 18 patients were infected with H. pylori. All patients underwent intubation with double-lumen tube and collection of cholecystokinin-stimulated pancretico-biliary secretions. Subsequently, normal saline, 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and autologous duodenal secretions were infused into the stomach in a randomized blinded fashion. A positive response was defined as the production of epigastric pain by acid and/or bile but not by saline. By this definition, only 6 patients (33%) had a positive response and none had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In patients with a negative response, only 4 remained asymptomatic during all infusions. The remaining 8 had symptoms during infusion of saline, 7 of whom also had symptoms during infusion of acid and/or duodenal secretions. Two of these patients had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In conclusion, the gastric mucosa in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia is not abnormally sensitive to acid or duodenal contents. \nFever response in elderly nursing home residents: are the older truly colder? OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that many nursing home residents with an apparently blunted fever response (maximum temperature less than 101 degrees F) may actually have a significant change in temperature (delta T greater than or equal to 2.4 degrees F) which is not recognized because of a low baseline temperature. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review for cases of infection that met specific criteria and for chart-recorded baseline and infection temperatures. Chart-recorded baseline temperatures were prospectively compared with re-measurement of morning temperatures. SETTING: Nursing Home Care Unit of the VAMC West Los Angeles. PATIENTS: Random review of 40 residents' charts resulted in the detection of 69 infections among 26 residents over a 20-month period. Fifty randomly selected residents prospectively underwent comparison of chart-determined and actual re-measurement of baseline temperatures. RESULTS: In 50 randomly selected residents, the mean oral baseline temperature of 97.4 +/- 0.2 (degrees F +/- SEM) closely approximated the mean nurse-recorded measures in the charts (97.6 +/- 0.1). Chart review detected 69 infections among 26 residents, with 53 episodes having a temperature recorded during the infection. The mean maximum temperature (Tmax) during an infection was 101.3 +/- 0.3 (degrees F +/- SEM) but 47% (25/53) of the episodes had a \"blunted\" fever response (Tmax less than 101 degrees F). Of the 25 \"blunted\" fevers (Tmax less than 101 degrees F), about one-fourth demonstrated an adequate change in temperature from baseline (delta T greater than or equal to 2.4 degrees F) but failed to reach 101 degrees F because of a low baseline. Most infections (89%) had a Tmax greater than 99 degrees F. CONCLUSION: Establishing a nursing home patient's basal temperature and monitoring for changes in temperature (delta T greater than 2.4 degrees F) and/or lowering the threshold for recognition of fevers (to 99 degrees or 100 degrees F) in nursing home residents with a change in function should assist in early recognition of infections. \nPrimary tumors of the facial (extracranial) nerve. Nearly 25% of all primary neurogenous tumors arise from peripheral nerves in the head and neck. The extracranial parts of the facial nerve, however, rank low as potential sites. Their tumors nonetheless pose diagnostic and management problems. In the intraparotid location the neurogenous tumors most often present as mass lesions, accompanied, in one third of patients, by various degrees of facial weakness. With the exception of a peculiar predilection of childhood plexiform neurofibromas to afflict the facial nerve, the majority of the tumors are neurilemomas. Recurrences are unusual after surgical removal of either neurilemomas or neurofibromas. The rare facial nerve sarcoma is a high-grade malignancy. \nMucinous pancreatic tumors: ERCP findings Mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas are rare and difficult to diagnose neoplasms. To further characterize the nature of these lesions, four such cases are described here in which the diagnosis was suspected at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography by the presence of ampullary or intraductal mucus. In one patient, pancreatoscopy directly visualized the tumor. Ultrasound and computed tomography failed to suggest the presence of a neoplasm in the majority of these cases, but endoscopic ultrasound was performed in one and correctly identified the multi-cystic tumor. A high incidence of acute pancreatitis was seen in these cases and was felt to be secondary to intermittent ductal obstruction by mucus. The characteristic appearance of intra-ductal mucus provides an important clue to the presence of this type of pancreatic neoplasia. \nAntibody to hepatitis C virus and liver disease in volunteer blood donors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the specificity of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and their relation to liver disease in blood donors. DESIGN: Case series of consecutive blood donors found positive for anti-HCV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients were evaluated for antibody specificity using a recombinant immunoblotting assay (RIBA) and were evaluated for biochemical evidence of liver disease. Patients showing increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels had a liver biopsy. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive blood donors found to be anti-HCV positive on both an initial and repeat ELISA. Inclusion criteria were as follows: an absence of hepatitis B surface antigens and non-organ-specific autoantibodies; a daily alcohol intake of less than 50 g; no history of recent hepatotoxic drug use; and normal serum levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin, and copper. MAIN RESULTS: Anti-HCV positivity was confirmed by RIBA in only 13 of 50 donors (26%) who had positive ELISA results. These 13 donors had an elevated ALT level and histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis, which was active in 8 patients (62%) and had already produced cirrhosis in 2 patients (15%). In contrast, the 17 donors with an intermediate RIBA pattern had only mild and often nonspecific histologic liver abnormalities. The 20 patients with a negative RIBA result had normal ALT levels. CONCLUSION: In blood donors, the anti-HCV RIBA is not only more specific than the anti-HCV ELISA, but is also useful in identifying patients who have an underlying chronic liver disease. \nCarcinoma of the uterus: use of gadopentetate dimeglumine in MR imaging. This prospective study assessed the role of gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the detection and staging of carcinomas of the endometrium and cervix. Surgical-pathologic findings were used as the standard of reference. In the evaluation of endometrial carcinoma, contrast-enhanced imaging improved tumor detection and differentiation between viable tumor and retained debris. Use of contrast material significantly improved the staging accuracy. The ability to assess the depth of myometrial invasion was also improved. In the evaluation of cervical carcinoma, assessment of tumor location and size did not improve following contrast enhancement. Use of gadopentetate dimeglumine resulted in overestimation of stromal, parametrial, vaginal, and/or bladder wall invasion in eight patients. However, evaluation of intratumoral architecture and large lesions was easier with contrast-enhanced imaging. When only stage II and higher disease was analyzed, use of contrast material improved the evaluation of disease extent. The authors conclude that gadolinium enhancement adds to the accuracy of evaluation of endometrial carcinoma but is useful in only advanced cases of cervical carcinoma. \nOsteogenic sarcoma arising adjacent to a long-standing ameloblastoma. A case report. Ameloblastoma is an uncommon odontogenic tumor usually occurring in the mandible. Rarely do other primary tumors occur with or arise from ameloblastoma. We describe a patient with simultaneous osteogenic sarcoma of the maxilla and recurrent ameloblastoma. \nPostradiation lower motor neuron syndrome presenting as monomelic amyotrophy. Monomelic amyotrophy developed 16 months, nine and 12 years after irradiation of the lumbosacral spinal cord for seminoma in one patient and for Hodgkin's disease in two others. In two patients, involvement was clinically limited to one leg, with a subacute course followed by plateau in the first case and with progressive worsening in the second one. In the third patient, the course was progressive with involvement of the other lower limb occurring five years later. From clinical and electrophysiological data, it seems probable that the disease process was a result of a selective injury to the lower motor neuron in the lower spinal cord. \nRight-to-left shunt across a patent foramen ovale caused by cardiac tamponade: diagnosis by transesophageal echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade can manifest as profound hypoxemia from intracardiac shunting across a patent foramen ovale. As a consequence, pulmonary embolus can be erroneously diagnosed. As demonstrated in the case described herein, transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in determining the correct diagnosis, especially if transthoracic echocardiography is technically limited. In our patient, the findings on transesophageal echocardiography also helped determine the appropriate treatment. The relative inaccessibility of the pericardial effusion to needle drainage prompted open surgical drainage. \nEMG activity in pericranial muscles during postural variation and mental activity in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic tension type headache. EMG activity was recorded over frontalis, temporalis and trapezius muscles in a supine position, a standing position and during a mental task in 32 female patients suffering from chronic tension-type headache and in 20 healthy volunteers. Measurements in patients were made before and after biofeedback therapy. All EMG levels were on average significantly higher in patients than in controls. 62.5% of patients had at least one abnormal EMG level, but only 34% were beyond the normal range, if 1 muscle and 1 recording condition was considered. EMG levels were not correlated with headache severity, anxiety or response to biofeedback treatment. It is therefore suggested that pericranial EMG activity is not pathogenetic in chronic tension type headache, but merely one of several pathophysiologic changes, that are produced by a central dysfunction. \nAnterior uveitis and hypopyon. We undertook a study to determine the incidence of hypopyon, as well as the most common anterior uveitis entities with which hypopyon is associated. A total of 216 patients with anterior uveitis were studied. The uveitis was acute in 155. Of the 155 patients, 11 (7.1%) had hypopyon. Nine of the 11 patients with hypopyon were positive for HLA B27. Of these nine, two had Reiter's syndrome and one had ankylosing spondylitis; the other six had no confirmed systemic disease. Of the two patients with hypopyon who were HLA B27-negative, one had mixed connective-tissue vascular disease, and one had idiopathic anterior uveitis. Of the 155 patients with acute anterior uveitis, 62 were HLA B27-positive. Thus, the incidence of hypopyon uveitis among HLA B27-positive patients was 14.5% (nine of 62 patients), whereas the incidence among HLA B27-negative patients was only 2.2% (two of 93 patients). These results suggest that HLA B27-related anterior uveitis is the most common cause of hypopyon uveitis, and that most patients with anterior uveitis associated with hypopyon will test positive for HLA B27. Although these results reflect a referral population, they should be of benefit in the treatment of patients with anterior uveitis. \nConcurrent eosinophilic fasciitis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Eosinophilic fasciitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome of T-cell malignant neoplasms? Eosinophilic fasciitis has been reported to precede hematologic malignant neoplasms such as myelomonocytic leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this case study, eosinophilic fasciitis occurred concurrently with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). The clinical diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis was based on painful sclerodermatous lesions on the extremities and trunk without acrosclerosis. There was histologic confirmation with edema and lymphocytic inflammation in the superficial muscular fascia and dermis. Deposition of immune reactants was found in the fascia and dermis. In addition, peripheral eosinophilia and circulating immune complexes were detected. The diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) was based on extensive erythematous cutaneous plaques, dermal and epidermal lymphocytic atypia, loss of pan-T-cell immunologic markers, and a cutaneous lesional T-cell receptor beta-chain rearrangement by Southern blot analysis. Eosinophilic fasciitis may occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with hematologic malignant neoplasms, including mycosis fungoides. Cytokines or lymphokines released by activated immunocytes, either malignant leukocytes or normal leukocytes reacting to malignant cells, may be responsible for the eosinophilia and sclerosis seen in these associated hematologic malignant neoplasms. \nAdhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization on patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The rate of adhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization has been described in two selective and unselective groups of patients with PCOS. The rate of this complication in the selective group was 0 from 16 ovaries and in the unselective group (5/25). However, the rate of major adnexal adhesion in the unselective group was 1 from 25 ovaries. \nAsperger's syndrome: who is being abused? Six case histories of children referred and admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit at a tertiary referral centre because of concerns about poor functioning and possible emotional abuse are presented. On initial assessment the children appeared to be well functioning and the impression was confirmed that their emotional needs were not being met by their parents. After detailed inpatient appraisal the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome was made in all six cases, exemplified mainly by a formal concrete way of thinking and an inability to identify and understand human emotions and relationships. The impact of the diagnosis on the parents and their consequent relationships with their child and their willingness to work with professionals is discussed. \nLarge molecular form of serum HBeAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection: relation to liver cell damage. We have separated circulating HBeAg into small and large molecular forms by agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed the relationship between the two forms and other clinical features of chronic hepatitis B, especially in regard to liver cell damage. The large HBeAg accounted for 7.3% +/- 3.4% of serum HBeAg in 9 subjects with normal liver histological findings or nonspecific reactive hepatitis, 38.0% +/- 27.8% in 32 patients with chronic persistent hepatitis and 65.6% +/- 23.3% in 21 patients with chronic active hepatitis (p less than 0.01). A positive correlation was seen between the height of aminotransferase elevations and the percentage of large HBeAg. Three patients who progressed from histologically normal liver or nonspecific reactive hepatitis to chronic active hepatitis had dramatic increases in the percentage of large HBeAg. The finding that the presence of large HBeAg in serum correlated with the severity of hepatitis suggests that HBeAg may play an important role in determining the degree of liver injury in chronic hepatitis B. \nIschaemic myelopathy secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation in AIDS. A 39-year-old patient with AIDS presented with a rapidly progressive myelopathy with a partial Brown-Sequard syndrome. He died, 9 weeks after onset of the first neurological signs, from diffuse encephalopathy. Neuropathological examination revealed multiple, usually small, frequently haemorrhagic, infarcts or various ages and numerous fibrin thrombi in medium and small penetrating vessels and capillaries of the brain and spinal cord, characteristic of disseminated intravascular coagulation. There were no inflammatory changes. Immunohistochemical studies for human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 were negative. Ischaemic spinal cord lesions due to disseminated intravascular coagulation may represent an unusual cause of focal, non-inflammatory, non-tumoral, myelopathic syndrome in AIDS. \nInfection by mink cell focus-forming viruses confers interleukin 2 (IL-2) independence to an IL-2-dependent rat T-cell lymphoma line. The development of T-cell lymphomas in rodents infected with type C retroviruses has been linked to the generation of a class of envelope (env) recombinant viruses called mink cell focus-forming viruses (MCF viruses) in the preleukemic thymus. To determine whether infection by MCF viruses altered the growth phenotype of retrovirus-induced T-cell lymphomas, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent rat T-cell lymphoma line (4437A) was infected with MCF-247, modified MCF-V33 (mMCF-V33), or NZB-xenotropic (NZB-X) virus. The effects of virus infection on the IL-2 dependence of these cells was examined by cultivating them in the absence of IL-2. After IL-2 withdrawal, the uninfected and NZB-X-infected cells went through a crisis period characterized by massive death. All the independently maintained cultures of MCF- and mMCF-V33-infected cells, on the other hand, became IL-2 independent without a crisis. All the polytropic virus-infected IL-2-independent cultures contained a population of cells that was polyclonal with regard to polytropic provirus integration. Over this polyclonal background each culture produced multiple clones of cells that were selected rapidly after IL-2 withdrawal. Furthermore, the resulting MCF- or mMCF-V33-infected IL-2-independent cells retained the expression of IL-2 receptor. These data show that MCF and mMCF-V33 viruses may alter the growth phenotype of a T-cell lymphoma line and suggest that their effect on cell growth may be due to the direct interaction of the MCF envelope glycoprotein with cellular components, perhaps the IL-2 receptor. \nPulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis. The presentation of a patient with multiple pulmonary nodules with or without cavitation and often with signs of a multisystemic vasculitis should suggest one of the pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis syndromes. The five conditions traditionally considered together in the category of pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis differ widely in their cause and pathogenesis and are more appropriately considered as variants or relatives of other processes. The radiologic features of this group of diseases, however, are similar, and it is useful to still consider them together. Table 1 summarizes the radiologic features of these conditions. \nAcanthoma fissuratum. Acanthoma fissuratum secondary to the use of spectacles is a rare clinical finding associated with an ill-fitting frame. An interesting case is presented to highlight such a problem. Surgical excision of such lesions is recommended with advice to the patient regarding the suitable fitting of spectacles. \nElectrophysiologic and anatomic characteristics of ventricular tachycardia induced at the right ventricular outflow tract but not at the apex. The site of ventricular stimulation is an important variable in the initiation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) by programmed ventricular stimulation. Among 169 patients studied consecutively, 17 (10%) had ventricular tachycardia induced by programmed electrical stimulation from the right ventricular outflow tract but not from the apex. Fourteen of these 17 patients had had prior myocardial infarction (12 had inferior, and two had both inferior and anterior myocardial infarction), two had a dilated cardiomyopathy, and one had a localized cardiomyopathy. Fourteen patients had echocardiograms suitable for analysis. Of these, 12 had posterior/inferior ventricular wall motion abnormalities located at the base of the heart. The ventricular effective refractory periods from the right ventricular outflow tract and right ventricular apex were 237 +/- 4 and 244 +/- 5 msec, respectively (p less than 0.05, mean +/- SEM). Induced VT had a cycle length of 229 +/- 4 msec and had the morphology of right bundle branch block in 12 patients, of left bundle branch block in three patients, and had both morphologies in two patients. In 14 patients the axis was superior. VT was initiated with two extrastimuli in 15 patients and with burst right ventricular pacing in two patients. Similar pacing techniques with identical pacing intervals did not induce VT at the right ventricular apex in 14 of these 17 patients. Further, among the 15 patients whose VT was induced at the right ventricular outflow tract with two extrastimuli, neither burst pacing (n = 13) nor two extrastimuli introduced at faster paced rates (n = 12) induced VT at the right ventricular apex. \nEffect of bile diversion and sphincterotomy on gallbladder muscle contractility and gallstone formation. Feeding prairie dogs a diet rich in cholesterol induces gallstone formation that is preceded by a sustained decrease in gallbladder smooth muscle contractility. Sphincterotomy is known to prevent gallstone formation in cholesterol-fed prairie dogs. Experiments were designed to determine whether the effect of sphincterotomy is a consequence of hepatic bile diversion, and whether bile diversion prevents the altered contractility. Following sham operation, surgical biliary enteric bypass, or sphincterotomy, prairie dogs were fed a high-cholesterol or a regular diet. Gallbladder muscle contractility and the presence of crystals and stones were determined. In sham-operated animals, the cholesterol diet induced a decrease in gallbladder muscle contractility and caused the formation of cholesterol gallstones. In animals with bile diversion and sphincterotomy, the effects of cholesterol feeding were reduced or prevented. Thus, these procedures may prevent stone formation by preventing a reduction in gallbladder contractility. Contractility was depressed in animals with bile diversion fed a regular diet, compared with animals with a sham operation fed a regular diet. The mechanism for this depression may differ from that induced by the cholesterol diet. Diversion, and perhaps sphincterotomy, impairs gallbladder filling. Thus, gallbladder muscle is not stretched and does not contract against a load. This could result in a \"disuse atrophy.\" If the results from our study apply to humans, sphincterotomy may reduce stone formation by preventing the effects of lithogenic bile on gallbladder muscle contractility and by enhancing the ability of the muscle to empty the lithogenic bile. \nAntibody to hepatitis C is common among patients with alcoholic liver disease with and without risk factors. Thirty-seven patients with clinically suspected alcoholic liver disease were retrospectively studied for the prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot assay. Twenty-four had biopsy-proven cirrhosis. Nineteen had identifiable risk factors for non-A, non-B viral hepatitis, and 18 did not. Five of 19 high-risk (26%) and 6 of 18 low-risk (33%) patients had positive antibody, compared with two of 179 healthy blood donors (p less than 0.01 for either group of alcoholics compared with blood donors). Nine of 11 ELISA-positive patients were also either positive or indeterminable by immunoblot testing. Histologic scores for parameters commonly associated with chronic viral hepatitis were numerically worse among anti-HCV-positive patients, but none reached statistical significance. Clinically, seven of 11 (64%) of anti-HCV-positive patients versus 14 of 26 (54%) anti-HCV-negative patients were Child's class C. Among the 21 Child's class C patients, seven (33%) were anti-HCV-positive versus four of 16 (25%) of Child's class A/B patients. A weak correlation between IgG and ELISA optical density was observed (r = 0.52). We conclude that antibody to hepatitis C by ELISA and immunoblot is common among alcoholics with liver disease even in the absence of known or suspected risk factors for viral hepatitis. Although hepatitis C-positive patients tended to have more severe histologic disease, neither histologic parameters nor clinical findings were adequate to predict antibody seropositivity. \nSite-directed mutagenesis of the region around Cys-241 of complement component C2. Evidence for a C4b binding site. We probed the functional significance of the region around Cys-241 in human C2 by testing the hemolytic activity of a series of mutant rC2. Mutant C2 cDNA were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis and expressed transiently in COS cells. Wild-type rC2 had threefold higher specific hemolytic activity than native serum C2. Substitution of Gly, Ala, or Ser for Cys-241 resulted in a slightly, but significantly, increased activity. In addition, I2 had no effect on the activity of these mutant C2. Substitution of Lys for Gln-243 increased the hemolytic activity by more than two-fold. Increased activity in all cases was due to slower decay rates of the C3 convertase. Finally, substitution of Leu or Ala for Asp-240 or Ser-244, respectively, resulted in more than 100-fold decrease of hemolytic activity. The results suggest that residues 240 to 244 of human C2 represent an important structural determinant of the C4b binding site of C2a. They also confirm that Cys-241 is the residue responsible for the increased activity of C2 reacted with I2. \nPsychiatric disorders in 36 families with Wolfram syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that heterozygous carriers of the gene for the Wolfram syndrome, who constitute about 1% of the population, are predisposed to significant psychiatric illness. The Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative syndrome in which 25% of the individuals who are homozygous for the condition have severe psychiatric symptoms that lead to suicide attempts or psychiatric hospitalizations. METHOD: The authors collected questionnaires, death certificates, and hospital records for blood relatives and their spouses in 36 families of individuals with the Wolfram syndrome and compared the proportion of blood relatives who had had psychiatric hospitalizations, had committed suicide, or had self-reported mental illness to the proportion of spouses with the same manifestations. RESULTS: The proportion of blood relatives who had had psychiatric hospitalizations, had committed suicide, or had self-reported mental illness significantly exceeded the proportion of spouses with the same manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Since heterozygous carriers of the gene for the Wolfram syndrome are 50-fold more common among the blood relatives than among the spouses, the larger proportion among blood relatives is evidence that heterozygous carriers of the gene for the Wolfram syndrome are predisposed to significant psychiatric illness. \nValue of sonography in monitoring the therapeutic response of mediastinal lymphoma: comparison with chest radiography and CT. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the diagnostic value of mediastinal sonography, compared with that of chest radiographs and CT, in the follow-up of patients with mediastinal lymphomas and in the prediction of clinical outcome. The sonograms, chest radiographs, and CT scans of 40 consecutive patients with Hodgkin (n = 29) and non-Hodgkin (n = 11) lymphoma obtained before and after completion of therapy were analyzed blindly and independently by three radiologists and compared with clinical outcome. Nine patients were treated with radiotherapy, 12 with chemotherapy, and 19 with combined therapy. Therapeutic response was assessed from all available clinical and biochemical findings as well as from the combined results of all imaging studies performed on further follow-up. The sonograms showed obvious changes in the size and echogenicity of the mediastinal lymphomas that corresponded closely with the response to therapy. Sonography showed complete regression of the lymphomas in 30 patients who had complete remission. In five patients with incomplete remission, sonographic diagnoses were correct. All lymph nodes, irrespective of size, detected with sonography after a phase of complete remission indicated recurrence (five patients). Sonographic findings corresponded with those of CT in 25 (81%) of 31 cases. Clinical outcome suggested that the sonographic findings were more reliable in the five cases in which CT and sonographic findings conflicted. Chest radiographs were inadequate for monitoring the response of mediastinal lymphomas to therapy; in 17 (43%) of 40 cases, a false impression was obtained of the extent and therapeutic response of mediastinal lymphomas. The results of this study indicate that sonography is clearly superior to chest radiographs and comparable to CT for monitoring patients with mediastinal lymphomas. \nPyruvate kinase activity and isozyme composition in normal fibrous tissue and fibroblastic proliferations. Pyruvate kinase (PK) was studied in 57 fibroblastic and fibrohistiocytic proliferations and normal fibrous tissue (n = 10). The specific activity was significantly increased in malignant tumors (1.67 +/- 0.25) compared with normal tissue (0.26 +/- 0.04; P less than 0.001) and benign proliferations (0.52 +/- 0.05; P less than 0.005). Although an overlap exists between aggressive fibromatosis and the benign group, high values of PK activity are indicative of Grade 2 and 3 malignancy. Significant shifts in isozyme pattern, favoring the expression of K-type subunits were found in tumors with a metastasizing potential and aggressive fibromatosis. These changes in the isozyme pattern of PK in aggressive fibromatosis may act as another argument to place them in the category of malignant fibroblastic tumors. \nEvaluation of mixed chimerism by in vitro amplification of dinucleotide repeat sequences using the polymerase chain reaction. The influence of mixed hematopoietic chimerism (MC) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation remains unknown. Increasingly sensitive detection methods have shown that MC occurs frequently. We report a highly sensitive novel method to assess MC based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Simple dinucleotide repeat sequences called microsatellites have been found to vary in their repeat number between individuals. We use this variation to type donor-recipient pairs following allogeneic BMT. A panel of seven microsatellites was used to distinguish between donor and recipient cells of 32 transplants. Informative microsatellites were subsequently used to assess MC after BMT in this group of patients. Seventeen of the 32 transplants involved a donor of opposite sex; hence, cytogenetics and Y chromosome-specific PCR were also used as an index of chimerism in these patients. MC was detected in bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood in 18 of 32 patients (56%) by PCR. In several cases, only stored slide material was available for analysis but PCR of microsatellites or Y chromosomal material could be used successfully to assess the origin of cells in this archival material. Cytogenetic analysis was possible in 17 patients and MC was detected in three patients. Twelve patients received T-cell-depleted marrow and showed a high incidence of MC as revealed by PCR (greater than 80%). Twenty patients received unmanipulated marrow, and while the incidence of MC was lower (44%), this was a high percentage when compared with other studies. Once MC was detected, the percentages of recipient cells tended to increase. However, in patients exhibiting MC who subsequently relapsed, this increase was relatively sudden. The overall level of recipient cells in the group of MC patients who subsequently relapsed was higher than in those who exhibited stable MC. Thus, while the occurrence of MC was not indicative of a poor prognosis per se, sudden increases in the proportions of recipient cells may be a prelude to graft rejection or relapse. \nLet sleeping dogs lie: role of the omentum in the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure. A surgical aphorism has long held that the omentum is the \"watchdog of the abdomen.\" However, detractors believe that leaving the omentum behind after colectomy precipitates later small bowel obstruction. A retrospective comparison was made between a group of 406 patients (Group I) having omentectomy with proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis and a group of 239 patients (Group II) having a similar procedure without omentectomy. Follow-up in this series of 645 patients was 4.3 +/- 2.1 years (mean +/- SEM). No difference was present in the rate of partial small bowel obstruction or complete small bowel obstruction between Group I patients (32 percent partial, 12 percent complete) and Group II patients (29 percent partial, 12 percent complete; P greater than 0.1). However, a better outcome with regard to postoperative sepsis and sepsis requiring operation was apparent in Group II patients retaining the omentum (4 percent and 3 percent, respectively) than in Group I patients (10 percent and 8 percent, respectively), in whom the omentum was removed (P less than 0.01). As this experience would support, we urge surgeons to \"let sleeping dogs lie\" and, when possible, retain the omentum when performing colectomy or proctocolectomy. \nHepatosplenic candidiasis: successful treatment with fluconazole. PURPOSE: To determine if fluconazole is effective treatment for hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients (ages 3 to 44) with acute leukemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who did not respond to prior antifungal therapy were treated with fluconazole. RESULTS: All six patients had fever and three had nausea and vomiting; computed tomographic (CT) scan showed lucencies in the liver in six, lucencies in the spleen in five, and lucencies in the kidneys in three. Prior therapy with 1.6 to 4 g of amphotericin B in the five adults and 526 mg of amphotericin B in the child (with the addition of flucytosine in four) failed to improve clinical symptoms or lucencies in the liver, spleen, and kidneys seen on CT scan. Fluconazole was given at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily (70 to 100 mg in the child) for 2 to 14 months. All patients had resolution of fever and other symptoms in 2 to 8 weeks. Improvement of the lesions noted on CT scan was seen in 4 to 8 weeks in all patients. Total resolution of lesions noted on CT scan occurred by 4 weeks in two patients, but took 4 to 5 months for three patients and 13 months for one patient. Three patients had relapse of their acute leukemia and two died, presumably cured of their candidiasis. Two patients underwent successful bone marrow transplantation without relapse of their candidiasis. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole appears to be useful in the treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine therapy. \nModerate protection of renal function and reduction of fibrosis by colchicine in a model of anti-GBM disease in the rabbit. A rabbit model of renal glomerulosclerosis induced by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody was used to determine whether colchicine would protect renal function and reduce fibrosis. Initial studies established the time course of renal function changes and fibrosis. Colchicine at a dose of 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg per day injected ip was begun at day 4 when injury had been initiated, and the experiment was ended at day 21 when fibrotic changes were established. Colchicine significantly reduced the rise in serum creatinine (serum creatinine = 2.7 +/- 0.3 mg% in vehicle-treated animals versus 1.8 +/- 0.1 mg% in colchicine-treated animals) and interstitial fibrosis (fibrosis score = 2.6 +/- 0.2 in vehicle-treated versus 1.5 +/- 0.2 in colchicine-treated animals). Colchicine treatment did not significantly affect weight, anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin level, % fibrocellular crescents formed, hydroxyproline per gram (dry weight) in tissue, or urine protein: creatine ratio. Regression analysis was performed to examine the interrelationships between variables for all animals and the effect of colchicine on pairs of variables. No clear-cut site of colchicine action could be identified. These data show that colchicine, in doses that could be used in humans, protected renal function by about 25% and reduced interstitial fibrosis in a model of severe crescentic nephritis. \nDiarrheal deaths in the United States, 1979 through 1987. A special problem for the elderly. OBJECTIVE.--Diarrhea is an important cause of death among young children in both developing and developed countries, but little is known about diarrheal death among adults. In this study, we examined trends in diarrheal deaths among all age groups in the United States. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS.--We reviewed national mortality data complied by the National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, Md, which consists of information from all death certificates filed in the United States for the period 1979 through 1987. A death for which diarrhea was listed as an immediate or underlying cause was considered a \"diarrheal death\" and included in the analysis. RESULTS.--We found that 28,538 persons died of diarrhea cited as either an immediate or the underlying cause of death during the 9-year period. A majority of diarrheal deaths occurred among the elderly (older than 74 years of age, 51%), followed by adults 55 to 74 years of age (27%), and young children (younger than 5 years of age, 11%). For the elderly, adjusted risk factors for dying of diarrhea included being white, female, and residing in a long-term care facility. Only the elderly and young children had clear, distinct winter peaks of diarrheal deaths, suggesting that the diarrhea may, in part, be infectious in origin. CONCLUSION.--For the elderly, more directed studies of those at risk, such as nursing home residents, are needed to determine if oral rehydration therapy, vaccines, or other preventive measures might benefit this population. \nAcute and chronic hemodynamic effects of xamoterol in mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Xamoterol, a new beta 1 partial agonist, has the potential to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone in patients with heart failure. Its properties should result in beta-receptor stimulatory effects at low levels of sympathetic tone and beta-receptor protective effects at higher levels of sympathetic tone. The acute effects of intravenous (i.v.) xamoterol on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise were studied in 30 patients with mild to moderate heart failure (13 patients in New York Heart Association class II; 17 in class III) due to ischemic (n = 24) or cardiomyopathic (n = 6) heart disease. Cardiac index, stroke volume and stroke work index at rest were significantly improved after i.v. administration of xamoterol and consistent with net agonist effects. During exercise, heart rate and double product were significantly reduced (net antagonist effects), but with preservation of the expected increases in cardiac index and systolic blood pressure. These hemodynamic findings confirm the ability of xamoterol to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone. Tachyphylaxis and arrhythmogenicity limit the chronic use of drugs with full beta-agonist properties as positive inotropes in heart failure. The patients were therefore entered into a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of chronic oral xamoterol therapy, 200 mg twice daily, and the hemodynamic responses to i.v. xamoterol were repeated at the end of the trial. No impairment in either resting or exercise effects was observed, indicative of a maintained response and absence of tachyphylaxis after chronic therapy. Furthermore, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed no change in ventricular arrhythmias during oral treatment. \nTrisomy 12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: an interphase cytogenetic study. Interphase cytogenetics by means of in situ hybridization with the chromosome 12-specific biotinylated alpha satellite DNA probe pSP 12-1 was used for the study of trisomy 12, the most common chromosomal abnormality in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In situ hybridization was performed on methanol/acetic acid fixed cells of conventional cytogenetic preparations from eight patients and on morphologically and immunologically classified cells of cytospin preparations from seven patients. The results show that trisomy 12 is more common than assumed on the basis of karyotype analysis of metaphase chromosomes: 2 of 13 patients with a normal karyotype in G-banding analysis were shown to have trisomy 12 by interphase cytogenetics. Immunophenotyping of the cells of one patient showed that the trisomy was restricted to cells with Ig light chain clonality. For the evaluation of the prognostic, therapeutic, and biologic significance of trisomy 12, in situ hybridization should be used in parallel with karyotype analysis because it allows the study of all cell populations of both interphase and mitotic cells, whether neoplastic or normal. \nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: a 10-year prospective screening study in four kindreds. A total of 80 individuals in 4 kindreds with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) have been subjected to repeated biochemical screening during a 10-yr period with the principal aim being to analyze characteristics of the developing pancreatic lesion. Age at presentation of the MEN 1 trait averaged 18 yr in 7 previously unaffected individuals, and this effect of the screening procedure represented a lowering by almost 2 decades. Pancreatic endocrine involvement was recognized at a mean age of 25 yr and constituted the presenting lesion in a majority of the patients. A standardized meal test and basal values of serum pancreatic polypeptide, insulin, proinsulin, and gastrin were the most efficient markers for the pancreatic lesion and preceded signs of pancreatic tumors upon radiological examinations by a mean of 3.5 yr. A 75% penetrance of the islet cell disease and 90% for primary hyperparathyroidism within the affected individuals equalled the prevalences reported in autopsy studies. Two of the kindreds showed signs of intrafamilial homogeneity with respect to the profile of peptide excess (P less than 0.05) and considerable discrepancy in the malignant potential of the pancreatic lesions. The results of early detection and surgical intervention of the pancreatic tumors in MEN 1 suggested an impact on morbidity, while any effect on the mortality of these individuals remains to be clarified. \nSurgical risk of hemorrhage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is increasingly recognized as a cause of lobar cerebral hemorrhage in normotensive elderly individuals. Isolated reports have suggested that neurosurgical intervention entails a high risk of precipitated hemorrhage. We identified 16 pathologically confirmed cases of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Fourteen of these patients presented with lobar cerebral hemorrhage. Fifteen neurosurgical procedures in eight patients included eight clot evacuations, three abscess drainage procedures, two ventriculoperitoneal shunts, one biopsy, and one lobectomy. Recurrent postoperative cerebral hemorrhage was seen in four patients at 2 days, 9 days, 6 weeks, and 10 months, but surgery was thought to have precipitated the cerebral hemorrhage in only one patient. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage also was seen in two of the eight nonoperated cases. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage is characteristic of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but we conclude that neurosurgical intervention, particularly evacuation of hematomas, is not associated with major risk of precipitated hemorrhage. \nVentricular fibrillation complicating endomyocardial biopsy of a cardiac allograft. Transvenous endomyocardial biopsy remains the most useful diagnostic aid in assessing rejection in the transplanted heart. Although invasive, the complications associated with endomyocardial biopsy are few, and the procedure is generally regarded as safe. We report a case of apparent ventricular fibrillation complicating transvenous endomyocardial biopsy. Histologic section revealed evidence of moderate acute rejection. This case represents the first report of a life threatening ventricular dysrhythmia following routine endomyocardial biopsy in a cardiac transplant recipient. \nCatheter-less suprapubic cystolithotomy in children. Bladder stones in children are common in developing countries and the procedure of choice for their removal is suprapubic cystolithotomy. It is standard practice to drain the bladder for a few days post-operatively to prevent urinary leakage. We have observed that, if the bladder is closed meticulously in 2 layers, bladder drainage by means of a catheter is not required. We have analysed 86 children treated by suprapubic cystolithotomy without a catheter. Size of the stones and intra-operative findings were noted and it was found that 85% of the patients had an excellent result; 10% had a satisfactory result and 4.7% were unsatisfactory. The advantages of the procedure and selection of the patients are discussed. \nDeleted HTLV-I provirus in blood and cutaneous lesions of patients with mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides, a rare form of cutaneous T cell leukemia/lymphoma, is suspected of having a viral etiology on the basis of certain similarities to adult T cell leukemia, which is associated with human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. Cell lines were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of an HTLV-I-seronegative patient with mycosis fungoides. DNA hybridization analysis revealed the presence of HTLV-I-related sequences with unusual restriction endonuclease sites. Sequence analysis of subcloned fragments demonstrated the presence of a monoclonally integrated provirus with a 5.5-kilobase deletion involving large regions of gag and env and all of pol. Additional evidence for the presence of deleted proviruses was found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA from cutaneous lesions of five other HTLV-I-seronegative patients. The findings suggest that HTLV-I infection may be involved in the etiology of at least certain cases of mycosis fungoides. \nProstate specific antigen in the management of patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with primary radiation therapy. The records of 143 patients treated at 5 institutions with external beam megavoltage irradiation for localized prostatic cancer were reviewed to evaluate post-treatment changes in prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the context of subsequent events. Complete responders were defined as patients clinically well with normal PSA, clinical failures were patients with documented local tumor recurrence or distant metastases and chemical failures were patients clinically well but with a PSA level above the upper limits of normal. Correlations with pre-treatment PSA values were also made for the 50 of 143 patients for whom pre-treatment PSA data were available. Median patient followup was 27 months (range 18 to 91 months). The data were analyzed with parametric and nonparametric univariate and multivariate statistical procedures. Pre-treatment PSA levels increased with increasing tumor stage (p = 0.004) but not with increasing summed Gleason pattern scores (p = 0.15). The probability of remaining a complete responder decreased with increasing stage (p = 0.008) but not with increasing Gleason score (p = 0.14). Increasing pre-treatment PSA correlated with clinical failure (p = 0.01) and chemical failure (p = 0.006). Of the patients with a pre-treatment PSA level of less than 4 times the upper limits of normal 83% remained as complete responders compared to 30% of those with a higher pre-treatment PSA (p = 0.0002). The return of PSA levels to the normal range within 6 months after treatment was strongly correlated with a favorable outcome when analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. The status at last followup of patients who had a normal PSA level at 6 months versus those with an elevated PSA level 6 months after treatment is 94% versus 8% for complete responders (p = 0.0001), 0% versus 60% for clinical failures (p = 0.002) and 6% versus 32% for chemical failures (p = 0.14). Similar results occurred when analyzing outcomes in relationship to PSA normalization within 12 months after treatment (p = 0.001 for clinical failures, p = 0.02 for chemical failures and p = 0.001 for complete responders). We conclude that the pre-treatment level of PSA is an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer patients treated with primary radiation therapy, and that the failure of PSA to return to the normal range within 1 year after completion of treatment identifies a group of patients at high risk for tumor recurrence. \nHemodynamic effects of direct angiotensin II blockade compared to converting enzyme inhibition in rat model of heart failure. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the chronic effects of converting enzyme inhibition with captopril to direct blockade of angiotensin II (AII) with DuP 753 in the rat model of hear",
