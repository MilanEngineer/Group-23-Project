        "text": " relative use of the two coffees was used to assess caffeine self-administration. Reliable caffeine self-administration occurred in three of 10 subjects in study 1 and seven of 12 subjects in study 2. Withdrawal symptoms were headaches, drowsiness, and fatigue. The major adverse effect from self-administration was tremulousness. The occurrence of headaches on substitution of decaffeinated coffee prospectively predicted subsequent self-administration of caffeine. These results indicate that some coffee drinkers exhibit signs of a caffeine dependence, ie, they self-administer coffee for the effects of caffeine, have withdrawal symptoms on cessation, and experience adverse effects. \nFour years of North American registry home parenteral nutrition outcome data and their implications for patient management. The OASIS Registry started annual collection of longitudinal data on patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in 1984. This report describes outcome profiles on 1594 HPN patients in seven disease categories. Analysis showed clinical outcome was principally a reflection of the underlying diagnosis. Patients with Crohn's disease, ischemic bowel disease, motility disorders, radiation enteritis, and congenital bowel dysfunction all had a fairly long-term clinical outcome, whereas those with active cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had a short-term outcome. The long-term group had a 3-year survival rate of 65 to 80%, they averaged 2.6 complications requiring hospitalization per year, and 49% experienced complete rehabilitation. The short-term group had a mean survival of 6 months; they averaged 4.6 complications per year and about 15% experienced complete rehabilitation. The registry data also indicated HPN was used for 19,700 patients in 1987 with therapy growth averaging about 8% per year. This growth was chiefly from new cancer patients. The number of new patients with long-term disorders in whom HPN was initiated appeared rather constant. We conclude that these clinical outcome assessments justify HPN for long-term patients, but the utility and appropriateness of HPN for the cancer and AIDS patients remains uncertain and requires further study. Medical, social, and fiscal aspects of HPN management in long-term and short-term patients appear to involve quite separate considerations. \nPost-endarterectomy headache and the role of the oculosympathetic system. A study was carried out on headache after carotid endarterectomy. A specific type of headache, similar in its characteristics to \"cluster headache\", occurred on the operative side in 30% of 54 patients, whereas no such headache occurred after extra-intracranial bypass or peripheral vascular surgery. This postoperative headache was not spontaneously reported by 56% of patients unless they were specifically asked about it. Pharmacological pupillary testing performed in 37 patients revealed that a decreased oculosympathetic activity (with or without adrenoceptor supersensitivity) was constantly associated with post-endarterectomy headache. Although this same abnormality was also observed in 54% of the patients without headache, a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) higher prevalence of decreased oculosympathetic responses was found in the patients with headache. The results suggest that damage to the sympathetic plexus due to the surgical procedure is involved in the development of postoperative \"cluster-like\" headache. \nImprovement of psoriatic arthritis in a patient treated with bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia. We describe a woman with psoriatic arthritis who experienced a remarkable improvement of her skin and joint disease while only taking bromocriptine therapy. She was treated with bromocriptine for primary infertility due to hyperprolactinemia. The improvement in joint symptoms appeared to parallel that of the skin. More studies are required to determine the reproducibility of this observation. \nRecovery of costal and crural diaphragmatic contractility from partial paralysis. Since the two muscles (costal and crural) that constitute the diaphragm are separate and histologically different, their individual recovery pattern from neuromuscular blockade also may be different. Therefore, we studied the recovery of force and shortening in the in vivo diaphragm from atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade in seven pentobarbital anesthetized dogs to assess segmental differences. Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), shortening of costal and crural segments, integrated electromyogram (EMG), and tidal volume (VT) were measured during spontaneous breathing. After atracurium had reduced VT to 30% of control, breathing parameters were followed until recovered to 90% of control values. In addition, force-frequency curves generated by supramaximal tetanic stimuli of the phrenic nerve were measured. Recovery times for tidal Pdi, tidal EMG, tidal shortening, low-frequency shortening, and twitch Pdi were twice as fast as for VT (40 +/- 4 min), reflecting a slower rate of recovery of accessory inspiratory muscles. High-frequency recovery was typically slower than that of VT. During tidal breathing and tetanic stimulation, costal and crural shortening recovered simultaneously. On the other hand, comparison between costal and crural by analysis of pressure-shortening relationships showed a segmental difference (crural shortened 30% more than costal at the same Pdi), which implied reduced afterload on the crural segment. However, since shortening and pressure were linearly related during paralysis and recovery, measurements of Pdi alone can accurately reflect changes in contractile mass when heterogeneity and afterload are controlled. \nTrends in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of spasticity [editorial] Spasticity develops after supraspinal or spinal lesions of descending motor systems, with obligate involvement of the corticospinal tract. Spasticity is characterized by an increase in muscle tone, which, in contrast to many other types of enhanced muscle tone, shows a marked velocity-dependent increase when the muscle is passively stretched. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this spastic muscle tone remain obscure. Three major causes are currently considered possible: (1) changes in the excitability of spinal interneurones; (2) receptor hypersensitivity; (3) formation of new synapses by sprouting. The latter mechanism could account for the long time course over which spastic muscle tone develops in hemiplegic or paraplegic patients, but there is no experimental evidence for this hypothesis. The electromyographic (EMG) gait analysis of patients with spasticity has thrown doubt on the common belief that the velocity-dependent increase in spastic muscle tone is evoked by stretch reflex activity and has led to the idea that spastic muscle tone resides in the muscle fibres themselves. While such a mechanism may contribute to the slowness of active movements in spastic patients, recent experiments on patients with spastic arm paresis have confirmed the classical view that the spastic muscle tone is related to the EMG activity evoked in the passively stretched muscle. This pathological EMG activity is seen during the entire range of the dynamic phase of the stretch, during which a normal muscle exhibits only an early, phasic burst at the highest stretch velocities employed. For the pharmacological treatment of spasticity, substances with different central or peripheral actions are available. Their assumed receptor actions are described, together with their main indications and side-effects. \nFatal brainstem stroke following internal jugular vein catheterization. Neurologic complications of central venous catheterization are uncommon, and there are no reports of cerebrovascular events. We report a case of massive postoperative vertebrobasilar territory stroke following internal jugular vein cannulation due to inadvertent vertebral artery injury. Autopsy revealed thrombosis at the site of puncture wound in the right vertebral artery, with emboli present in the distal basilar artery. \nEfficient diagnosis of common complaints: a comparative study in the United States and England. BACKGROUND. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the diagnostic efficiency of American and British family and general practitioners, as measured by their utilization of health care resources and the average length of the diagnostic interval, in diagnosing common complaints. METHODS. Several hundred charts from teaching practices in the United States and England were identified by computer search and reviewed. The charts were those of patients who had presented between 1978 and 1988 with a complaint of chest pain and were subsequently diagnosed as having angina pectoris or reflux esophagitis, or who presented with a complaint of shortness of breath and were subsequently diagnosed as having heart failure or asthma. RESULTS. The results of this study, which compared teaching family medicine practices in the United States and England, suggest that American family physicians diagnose common complaints such as chest pain and dyspnea in a shorter time with fewer visits and fewer consultations than their English counterparts, but order approximately the same number of diagnostic tests. CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates the difficulties in interpreting international (cross-cultural) comparisons. Differences may be due to varying health care systems, economic factors, physician training, and physician practice styles, as well as patient expectations. \nComplications associated with brachytherapy alone or with laser in lung cancer. Relatively little has been reported about destruction through brachytherapy of mucosa-perforating and extraluminary tumors with probable large vessel involvement causing major hemorrhagic or fistular complications. We report 12 patients subjected to laser and brachytherapy for centrally occluding lung cancer, whom we have periodically followed up from June 1986 until they died. Although all laser procedures were free from complications, necrotic cavitation in five cases, two of which were accompanied by large bronchoesophageal fistulas, and massive fatal hemoptysis occurred in six. Minor complications included radiation mucositis (two), noncritical mucosal scarring (two), and cough (four). Characteristics that will identify patients at risk of developing fatal hemoptysis and fistulas should be better defined by imaging and endoscopic techniques. In such cases, modifying the protocol or using alternative procedures should be considered. Minor complications, such as cough, can be avoided by using topical steroid therapy (eg, beclomethasone dipropionate). \nGenetic control of immunopathology induced by Mycobacterium leprae. The pathogenesis of leprosy is almost totally attributable to the immune response of the host towards Mycobacterium leprae, a virtually non-toxic intra-cellular parasite. At one end of the leprosy spectrum are tuberculoid leprosy patients, who develop immunity but also delayed-type hypersensitivity towards M. leprae; at the other end are lepromatous leprosy patients, who lack helper T cell activity and therefore do not develop immunity, but who can nevertheless produce antibodies that may cause immunopathology due to immune complexes. A range of immunopathology is seen between these poles. \nGenital human papillomavirus infection in men. Diagnosis and treatment with a laser and 5-fluorouracil. One hundred twenty-eight consecutive men, sexual partners (for more than six months) of women treated for genital condylomata acuminata, were evaluated with colposcopy to assess the percentage of infected men among the couples. Ninety-three (73%) of the men were found to have a genital human papillomavirus infection on colposcopically directed biopsies. All but one patient were treated with outpatient colposcopically guided laser vaporization under local anesthesia (one patient with extensive condylomata required general anesthesia). Two weeks after laser surgery, 5% 5-fluorouracil cream, used in the genital area, was initiated on a weekly basis for two months and every other week for two more months. Patients were followed in the clinic with colposcopy performed every eight weeks for six months to evaluate the regimen's results. Thirty-seven (40%) of the 93 men had \"clinically\" apparent genital HPV infection, and 56 (60%) of the 93 had \"subclinical\" disease (as determined with colposcopy). The majority of the patients (87 of 93, or 94%) responded to one laser treatment followed by 5-fluorouracil cream and had no visible lesions at six months. Colposcopic evaluation of the male partners of infected women and laser surgery followed by topical 5-fluorouracil therapy appear to be safe and effective in controlling genital HPV infection. \nSensorineural hearing loss and the Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. Sensorineural hearing loss has not been previously reported in patients with the Marinesco-Sjogren Syndrome. Two siblings are described where hearing was initially normal but subsequently deteriorated. \nCoughing and central venous catheter dislodgement. Silastic central venous catheters are subject to dislodgement from a variety of causes. Only one occurrence of catheter dislodgement has been previously reported in connection with coughing. We report four additional cases of silastic central venous catheter dislodgement associated with forceful coughing paroxysms, alone or in combination with emesis or rectal tenesmus. Three episodes of catheter dislodgement occurred in adolescents or young adults with cystic fibrosis, who may constitute a particularly high-risk group. Dislodgement in two patients was asymptomatic. These case suggest that patients with frequent or severe paroxysms of increased intrathoracic pressure may be at higher risk of catheter dislodgement. Since dislodgement may be initially asymptomatic and can cause serious complications, a high index of suspicion for dislodgement in patients with silastic central venous catheters and coughing paroxysms is advised. \nInfluence of human immunodeficiency virus infection on cell-mediated immunity in chronic D hepatitis. To determine whether the abnormalities of cell-mediated immunity described in chronic D hepatitis are associated with hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection or concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, serologic and tissue hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV markers and T lymphocyte subsets were studied in serum samples from 38 patients with chronic D hepatitis, 26 of whom had HIV infection. Patients with chronic D hepatitis and HIV infection had significantly lower peripheral blood T4:T8 ratios resulting from a significant increase in T8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells, while numbers of T lymphocyte subsets were normal in cases with chronic D hepatitis only. HIV+ patients showed an increase in HBV replication (identified by hepatitis B core antigen in liver and hepatitis B e antigen and HBV DNA in serum) and in HDV replication (tissue D antigen and HDV RNA) without evidence of more active liver disease. Probably the immunologic disturbances detected in chronic D hepatitis are secondary to HIV infection, do not contribute to the pathogenesis of liver injury, and are associated with increased viral B and D replication. \nDuP 753 increases survival in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats fed a high sodium diet. We studied the effects of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DuP 753, on blood pressure, body weight, plasma renin activity, sodium excretion, and mortality in male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp) fed a 4% NaCl diet for 12 weeks. The rise in blood pressure, due to high sodium intake, was blunted in the first 8 weeks of the study in the DuP 753-treated group; however, it started slowly to rise in the following weeks. In the untreated group, blood pressure rose steadily and it was significantly higher than that of the treated group during the whole experimental period. DuP 753-treated rats gained weight continuously during the study in contrast to the untreated group, where weight gain was arrested after 4 weeks. Plasma renin activity rose significantly after 4 weeks of treatment with DuP 753; by week 6 its values returned to baseline values and remained at these lower values until week 12. In the untreated group, plasma renin activity was not suppressed by high sodium intake after 4 weeks; it continued to rise and it was significantly elevated by 8 and 12 weeks. Survival at 12 weeks was 84% in DuP 753-treated group and 26% in the untreated group. The data demonstrate that DuP 753 decreased mortality and dramatically blunted the blood pressure rise in SHRsp fed a high sodium diet. \nEndometriosis of the terminal ileum simulating the clinical, roentgenographic, and surgical findings in Crohn's disease. A 38-yr-old nulliparous female presented with endometriosis of the terminal ileum which mimicked the clinical, roentgenographic, and surgical findings of Crohn's disease. The patient presented with diarrhea, right lower quadrant pain, fever, and significant weight loss. At surgery, the terminal ileum was inflamed, indurated, thickened, and angulated. Ileal endometriosis may be expected to simulate Crohn's disease, because intestinal endometriosis frequently produces local bowel inflammation, adhesions, stricture, and angulation. Ileal endometriosis should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease in menstruating females who are nulliparous and have dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, menometrorrhagia, or other perimenstrual symptoms. It is important not to mistake endometriosis for Crohn's disease because endometriosis has a different therapy. \nClinical and flow cytometry characteristics of malignant pleural effusions in patients after intracavitary administration of methylprednisolone acetate. Ten patients with recurrent pleural effusions due to advanced cancer were treated by intracavitary methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol [DM], Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI). They received one to six courses of DM (median, three courses per patient) with doses ranging from 80 to 160 mg per course. Effusion cells were cryopreserved before and during DM installation for subsequent determination of ploidy by flow cytometry. Pleural effusion in all three patients with advanced breast cancer resolved and did not reaccumulate throughout follow-up for 11+, 10+, and 8+ months. Pleural effusion in a patient with metastatic gastric cancer and in two of four patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown origin partially resolved. Altogether six of ten patients (60%) subjectively and objectively benefited from this therapy. All patients tolerated the treatment well with no local or systemic side effects. Flow cytometry showed a reduction in ploidy of effusion cells in all three patients with breast cancer, from a peak mean channel of 6C to nearly 2C after therapy. Transient reduction of ploidy was seen also in the effusion of a patient with unknown primary tumor associated with clinical improvement. The clinical and laboratory data reported offers initial evidence that DM when instilled into the pleural cavity after incomplete thoracentesis may act as effective palliative therapy either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents. \nTotal hip arthroplasty following failed internal fixation of hip fractures. A retrospective review was performed on 27 consecutive patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) following failure of internal fixation of fractures of the proximal femur. The results were comparable to primary THA in femoral neck fractures. Considerably less satisfactory results were obtained in THA in intertrochanteric fractures. Bone loss and medial displacement of the femoral shaft led to high incidence of intraoperative complications and postoperative dislocations. Extreme care must be taken to avoid fracture and penetration of the femoral shaft. Autograft, allograft, or head and neck replacement components should be available for reconstruction of the difficult cases. \nA randomized trial of amsacrine and rubidazone in 39 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Thirty-nine patients with untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were randomly allocated to receive rubidazone (zorubicin) 200 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 4 plus cytarabine (Ara C) 200 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 7 (arm A, 21 patients), or amsacrine (Amsa) 150 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 4 plus Ara C 200 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 7 (arm B, 18 patients). Prophylaxis of disseminated intravascular coagulation was made by platelet transfusions and heparin. In case of leukemic resistance, patients received a second course with 2 days of rubidazone (arm A) or Amsa (arm B) and 3 days of Ara C. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received three consolidation courses with the two drugs used for induction and maintenance therapy for 3 years. Two patients in arm A and one in arm B were allografted in first CR. Initial characteristics were similar in both arms. In arm A, 18 patients (86%) reached CR, two had hypoplastic death, and one had leukemic resistance after two courses. In arm B, 12 patients (66%) achieved CR, two had early death (CNS bleeding, one case; ventricular fibrillation, one case), and four had resistant leukemia after two courses. The difference in CR rate between the two arms was not significant. In arm A, disease-free survival (DFS) showed a plateau at 54.3% after 34 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.1% to 74.9%), with eight CRs longer than 34 months. In arm B, DFS was significantly shorter (P less than .03), showing a plateau at 16.7% after 38 months (95% confidence interval, 4.7% to 44.6%), and only two prolonged CRs were seen. The difference in DFS remained significant after censoring allografted patients and patients who died in CR (one in arm A, two in arm B). Our results suggest that Amsa-Ara C combinations may be inferior to anthracycline-Ara C combinations in the treatment of APL, because they seem to provide shorter DFS and, possibly, a higher incidence of initial leukemic resistance. However, studies with larger numbers of patients are required. \nClinical findings associated with pulmonary embolism in a rehabilitation setting. In a rehabilitation setting, pulmonary embolism is a relatively frequent and life-threatening complication. Deciding when a patient may be experiencing this condition is difficult, however, because of frequent deficits in patient communication skills (eg, aphasia and cognitive deficits) and the multisystem illnesses affecting many rehabilitation patients. We reviewed the charts of 30 rehabilitation patients transferred emergently during the years 1986 to 1988 with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, which was subsequently documented by ventilation-perfusion scanning. The average age of the 30 patients was 65; 63% were women and 20 (67%) had an admitting diagnosis of stroke. The most common new-onset clinical findings in the 24 hours before discharge were unusual facial skin color changes (pale, flushed, or cyanotic) (57%), chest or upper back pain (47%), tachycardia (heart rate more than 100 bpm) (40%), hypoxemia (arterial oxygen saturation less than or equal to 90%) (40%), and fever less than 101F (37%). In 63% of the patients, either anxiety, restlessness, diaphoresis, or dyspnea was also noted in the 24 hours before discharge. The data suggest that careful physician and nursing scrutiny may identify clinical signs characteristic of pulmonary embolism, and that the de novo appearance of these constellations of findings may help to select candidates for ventilation-perfusion scanning. \nLong-term survival in patients operated on for benign peptic ulcer disease. Survival rate was analysed in a cohort of 6459 patients who had undergone partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease and who had survived the first year after operation. The cohort was followed for 27-35 years. There was a slight but significant decrease in relative survival rate to 92 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval 87-97 per cent) 35 years after operation. No decrease in relative survival rate was observed during the first 20 years after operation. There was no difference by gender or surgical procedure, but patients operated on for gastric ulcer, compared with duodenal ulcer, and patients operated on at younger ages had a poorer relative survival rate. The effects of partial gastrectomy on survival, both overall and by diagnosis or age at operation, are probably attributable to confounding factors linked with the peptic ulcer disease rather than to the surgical procedure itself. We conclude that partial gastrectomy seems to have very little impact on survival once the patient has survived the first year after operation. \nMineral spirits inhalation associated with hemolysis, pulmonary edema, and ventricular fibrillation. A previously healthy 42-year-old woman developed severe dyspnea, chest discomfort, and malaise several hours after prolonged exposure to concentrated vapors from mineral spirits. On the way to the hospital, she sustained a cardiopulmonary arrest; on arrival several minutes later, she was found to be in ventricular fibrillation and was resuscitated. Her hospital course included slowly resolving cardiac abnormalities, amnesia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, abrupt hemolytic anemia, sustained rhabdomyolysis, and other metabolic abnormalities. It is highly probable that this syndrome represented acute and near-lethal toxicity caused by the inhalational exposure to the petroleum distillate known as mineral spirits. It is important that physicians be aware of this syndrome in order to recognize it on presentation and to warn patients of the risk of such toxic exposure. \nPituitary adenoma: correlation of half-dose gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging with surgical findings in 26 patients. Sellar magnetic resonance imaging studies obtained with half doses of gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.05 mmol/kg) were prospectively interpreted and retrospectively rated in 26 patients who subsequently underwent transsphenoidal sellar surgery for suspected pituitary adenoma. Studies included a sagittal scout view followed by a non-contrast-material-enhanced, an immediate postcontrast, and a delayed postcontrast T1-weighted image (obtained at 1.0 or 1.5 T). Ten of 11 confirmed microadenomas were identified prospectively; all were identifiable in retrospect. Macroadenomas (12 cases) were well demonstrated. The high signal intensity of the posterior pituitary and of intrasellar hemorrhage was obscured on postcontrast studies. Delayed images proved unnecessary. This prospective evaluation suggests that a half-dose study is comparable to retrospective studies in which full-dose techniques were used for detection of micro- and macroadenomas. Imaging times are reasonably short, and cost of contrast material is potentially reduced. Confirmation with larger studies is required, and careful endocrinologic and clinical follow-up of nonsurgical patients is necessary. \nMetastatic basal cell carcinoma: report of a case presenting with respiratory failure. Metastasis from basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of skin is rare. A case of a 58-year-old male presenting with increasing shortness of breath and right pleural effusion is described. Open right pleural biopsy demonstrated metastatic carcinoma consistent with BCC. Review of medical records from another hospital revealed that four years previously a recurrent BCC had been excised from the left back. One and three years prior to this excision, a skin lesion at this same site had been treated with electrocautery. Review of the skin excision slides demonstrated infiltrating BCC histologically very similar to the metastatic pleural neoplasm. The patient died two months after the pleural biopsy. At autopsy, the cutaneous BCC had not recurred and metastatic BCC extensively infiltrated the pleura bilaterally, with focal involvement of underlying lung parenchyma, subcarinal lymph nodes, diaphragm, and pericardium. \nEffect of temporary occlusion of hypogastric arteries on blood loss during radical retropubic prostatectomy. We report on a prospective, partially randomized study of 130 patients, examining the effect of temporary occlusion of the hypogastric arteries on intraoperative blood loss, perioperative blood replacement and change in preoperative to postoperative hematocrit. We observed no significant difference in any of these parameters when comparing patients who did and did not undergo intraoperative occlusion of the hypogastric arteries. These findings suggest that temporary occlusion of the hypogastric arteries during radical prostatectomy does not have a major effect on the blood loss associated with this operation. Extensive collateral circulation to the prostate and a substantial venous component of blood loss may explain these findings. Banking of 3 units of autologous blood preoperatively would have decreased the need for homologous transfusions in the majority of patients. \nA new manifestation and treatment alternative for heparin-induced thrombosis. We treated a coronary artery bypass patient whose postoperative course was complicated by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and resultant pulmonary artery and saphenous vein graft thromboses. The pulmonary thromboemboli were found first, and pulmonary blood flow was restored with intravenously administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A short time later, the vein grafts were found to be occluded, and we subsequently performed multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) using tPA as an adjuvant to oral warfarin sodium therapy with excellent results. We conclude that heparin-induced thromboses in the pulmonary arteries are amenable to thrombolytic therapy, including tPA, whereas this regimen appears to have little effect on saphenous vein grafts. We also found that a combination of warfarin and thrombolytic therapy is an alternative regimen for heparin-intolerant patients who require PTCA. \nSeminal polyamines as agents of cervical carcinoma: production of aneuploidy in squamous epithelium. The effects of several polyamines found in seminal fluid on the cell cycle and ploidy of three cervical cell lines and of primary epithelial cells cultured from cervical biopsy specimens were monitored by fluorescent flow cytometry. The rate of cell growth did not change but there were indications of either hypodiploidy or hyperdiploidy in some cultures at certain concentrations of spermine and spermidine. An interaction of exogenous polyamines with the DNA of cervical cells was shown to occur, leading to changes in ploidy with, perhaps, the potential to induce or promote dysplasia. \nThe value of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs for acute conversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter to sinus rhythm. In a single-blind randomized study, the efficacy and safety of intravenous propafenone (2 mg/kg body weight per 10 min) versus flecainide (2 mg/kg per 10 min) were assessed in 50 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Treatment was considered successful if sinus rhythm occurred within 1 h. Conversion to sinus was achieved in 11 (55%) of 20 patients with atrial fibrillation treated with propafenone and in 18 (90%) of 20 with atrial fibrillation treated with flecainide (p less than 0.02). If atrial fibrillation was present less than or equal to 24 h, conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 8 (57%) of 14 patients in the propafenone group and 13 (93%) of 14 in the flecainide group (p less than 0.05). Atrial flutter was converted in two (40%) of five patients treated with propafenone and in one (20%) of five with flecainide (p = NS). Mean time to conversion was 16 +/- 10 min in the propafenone group versus 18 +/- 13 min in the flecainide group (p = NS). QRS lengthening (83 +/- 15 to 99 +/- 20 ms) was observed only in the patients treated with flecainide (p less than 0.001). Patients successfully treated with propafenone showed significantly higher plasma levels than those whose arrhythmia did not convert to sinus rhythm. Transient adverse effects were more frequent in the flecainide group (40%) than in the propafenone group (8%) (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, at a dose of 2 mg/kg in 10 min, flecainide is more effective than propafenone for conversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. However, considering the propafenone plasma levels and very few adverse effects, the dose or infusion rate, or both, used in the propafenone group may not have been sufficient to achieve an optimal effect. Neither drug seems very effective in patients with atrial flutter. \nLongitudinal study of cerebral spinal fluid drainage in polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase in paraplegia associated with thoracic aortic cross-clamping. It has been hoped that pharmacologic prophylaxis in thoracic aortic cross-clamping may avert the unpredictable complication of spinal cord paraplegia, may avoid the mechanical difficulties associated with shunts, partial bypass, or monitoring devices, and may serve as a substitute for or as an adjunct to cerebral spinal fluid drainage. Toward this end 21 mongrel dogs were studied in four groups and underwent 60 minutes of thoracic aortic cross-clamping: group I, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping; group II, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and cerebral spinal fluid drainage; group III, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping, cerebrospinal fluid drainage and intravenous administration of a single dose (5000 units/kg) of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) given 15 to 20 minutes before thoracic aortic cross-clamping; and group IV, six with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and PEG-SOD. Paraplegia was graded by the Tarlov method at 24 hours and up to 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. The carotid and femoral artery pressures, the central venous pressure, and core temperature, taken during the experiment and at the time the dogs were killed, were found to be similar between groups. At 24 hours all dogs in group I were paraplegic; groups II and III had no paraplegic dogs (p less than 0.01), and group IV had fewer paraplegic dogs (two of six) than group I (p less than 0.05). Paraplegia was averted in all dogs treated with cerebral spinal fluid drainage, even 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. \nQTc prolongation measured by standard 12-lead electrocardiography is an independent risk factor for sudden death due to cardiac arrest. BACKGROUND. QTc prolongation has been implicated as a risk factor for sudden death; however, a controversy exists over its significance. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the Rotterdam QT Project, 6,693 consecutive patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were followed up for 2 years; of these, 245 patients died suddenly. A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and clinical data at the time of 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were collected for all patients who died suddenly and for a random sample of 467 patients from the study cohort. In all patients without an intraventricular conduction defect (176 patients who died suddenly and 390 patients from the sample), QT interval duration was measured in leads I, II, and III and corrected for heart rate with Bazett's formula (QTc). In patients without evidence of cardiac dysfunction (history of symptoms of pump failure or an ejection fraction less than 40%), QTc of more than 440 msec was associated with a 2.3 times higher risk for sudden death compared with a QTc of 440 msec or less (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.9). In contrast, in patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction, the relative risk of QTc prolongation was 1.0 (0.5, 1.9). Adjustment for age, gender, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and the use of drugs did not alter these relative risks. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that in patients without intraventricular conduction defects and cardiac dysfunction, QTc prolongation measured from the standard electrocardiogram is a risk factor for sudden death independent of age, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and drug use. In patients with cardiac dysfunction, QTc duration is not related to the risk for sudden death. \nGadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced chemical-shift MR imaging of the breast. Standard T1-weighted MR images enhanced with gadopentetate dimeglumine show relatively minimal enhancement of breast lesions due to the high background signal from fat in the breast. Strongly enhancing lesions may become isointense relative to the fat signal and become invisible or indistinct after contrast administration. Fat-suppressed chemical-shift imaging (CSI) combined with administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine improves lesion detection and characterization in other areas of the body where a strong lipid signal is present. We evaluated this technique in the breast. Twenty patients with mammographic lesions were studied with standard unenhanced T1- and T2-weighted images and enhanced T1-weighted images, as well as with CSI before and after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. The series were ranked independently for border and matrix characteristics. The border was assessed for a smooth, irregular, or spiculated margin. The matrix or internal substance was evaluated for visibility and type of enhancement, homogeneous or inhomogeneous. The enhanced CSI images were superior to all other images in the depiction of border and matrix characteristics. Of 20 patients, a corresponding mass was detected on MR in 14. In two of the 14 patients, the lesion was seen only in the enhanced CSI images. Chemical-shift artifacts on enhanced T1-weighted images obscured border detail in several cases. Enhanced CSI improves visualization of breast lesions as compared with conventional MR imaging with or without enhancement. The enhanced CSI technique produces differential enhancement between glandular tissue and lesions while suppressing the signal from fat. This improves the visualization of border and matrix characteristics and depicts lesions that otherwise might be obscured. \nSafety-belt injuries in children with lap-belt ecchymosis: CT findings in 61 patients. We have noted a complex of common injuries in children wearing lap-styled safety belts during vehicular accidents. Sixty-one children who were restrained passengers in motor vehicle crashes had linear ecchymosis across the abdomen and had CT for abdominal trauma. Thirteen children (21%) had a lumbar spine injury, and 14 children (23%) injured a hollow viscus (bowel, 12; bladder, two); five children (8%) had both spine and hollow viscus injuries. Abnormal findings on abdominal CT were recognized retrospectively in three of 13 children with lumbar spinal injury. Lateral radiographs of the spine showed lumbar spinal injury in all cases. Free intraperitoneal air was noted in on three (25%) of 12 children with bowel injury. In eight of those children, CT showed large, unexplained collections of peritoneal fluid. The presence of lap-belt ecchymosis should prompt a careful search for spine, bowel, and bladder injury. Recognition of the limitations of CT diagnosis of these injuries is important to reduce errors in interpretation. \nAchromobacter xylosoxidans. An unusual neonatal pathogen. Perinatal acquisition of a rare pediatric pathogen, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, with evidence for in utero transmission, is described. Cultures from the mother and neonate demonstrated A. xylosoxidans. An ascending bacterial infection in the mother with clinical chorioamnionitis is presented as the probable mode of transmission. Postmortem examination of the infant confirmed Achromobacter meningitis. In contrast to the current case with transmission from mother to neonate, previously published neonatal cases of Achromobacter infections indicate that nosocomial transmission of the organism is most common (79%). In addition, the literature review revealed a high mortality associated with meningitis (77%), frequent hydrocephalus, and subsequent neurologic sequelae (36%). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first documented case of maternal-fetal transfer of A. xylosoxidans. \nComplexes of activated protein C with alpha 1-antitrypsin in normal pregnancy and in severe preeclampsia. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent regulator of blood coagulation. Activated protein C is regulated in plasma in large part by two inhibitors, protein C inhibitor and alpha 1-antitrypsin. Complexes of activated protein C with both inhibitors in plasma samples from subjects with normal or pathologic pregnancy were measured. In normal pregnancy we observed a progressive and significant increase in activated protein C/alpha 1-antitrypsin complex levels, from 9 +/- 3 ng/ml in the first trimester to 16 +/- 3 ng/ml in the third trimester, as well as an increase in alpha 1-antitrypsin plasma levels. In severe preeclampsia, but not in chronic hypertension with superimposed severe preeclampsia, there was a greater increase in activated protein C/alpha 1-antitrypsin levels (25 +/- 10 ng/ml) (p less than 0.001) and a decrease in protein C and protein C inhibitor levels as compared with normal pregnant women at similar gestational ages. These data show an increase in the activation of the protein C pathway in both normal and pathologic pregnancy and provide evidence for an enhancement of thrombin generation in severe preeclampsia compared with chronic hypertension with superimposed severe preeclampsia. \nBroncholithiasis: CT features in 15 patients. Broncholithiasis is a disorder characterized by peribronchial calcific nodal disease that either erodes into an adjacent bronchus or distorts the bronchi. The key radiologic finding is a calcified endobronchial or peribronchial lymph node. To determine the CT findings of broncholithiasis, we retrospectively reviewed the chest radiographs and CT scans of 15 patients with proved broncholithiasis. Ten patients had endobronchial nodes as proved by bronchoscopy, surgery, or lithoptysis. Broncholiths were identified on bronchoscopy in only five cases. Five patients had peribronchial nodes with associated bronchial distortion. Collimation of the CT scans varied; 1.0-cm-, 0.6-cm-, and 0.5-cm-thick sections were obtained. Three patients had both 1.0-cm- and 0.5-cm-thick sections. The calcified lymph node was identified on CT in all 15 patients. CT correctly localized six of 10 endobronchial nodes and four of five peribronchial nodes. Findings due to bronchial obstruction also were seen on CT; atelectasis (n = 11), infiltration (n = 4), bronchiectasis (n = 4), and air trapping (n = 1). An associated soft-tissue mass was not seen in any case. Difficulty in determining the relationship between lymph node and bronchus is due to volume averaging, which can be decreased by scanning thinner sections. CT can suggest the diagnosis of broncholithiasis and is useful when bronchoscopy does not show a broncholith. \nTocainide therapy in muscle cramps and spasms due to neuromuscular disease. Significant improvement in symptoms of disabling cramps and muscle spasms was obtained in 9 patients with motor neuron diseases, tetany, and myotonic disorders who were treated with tocainide, a lidocaine analog. No significant side effects were observed except for light-headedness and fatigue in 1 patient, who also showed slight prolongation of intraventricular conduction time. Tocainide is useful in treating disabling muscle spasms and cramps associated with conditions characterized by neuromuscular irritability. This effect is probably based on stabilization of the membrane potential at various levels (motor neurons, peripheral nerve, or muscle fiber membrane). \nHeadache in transient or permanent cerebral ischemia. Dutch TIA Study Group. We studied headache features in 3,126 patients with acute cerebral or retinal ischemia. Headache occurred in 18% of these patients (in 16% of all patients with transient ischemic attacks, in 18% of patients with reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, and in 19% of patients with minor strokes) and was mostly continuous in all types of attacks. Headache was present in 16% of patients with monocular visual symptoms. The occurrence of headache was not related to the mode of onset, mode of disappearance, or duration of the attack. Patients with headache more often were known to have heart disease. Headache was less frequent in patients with small deep infarcts, who were more often hypertensive, and in patients with infarcts in the anterior circulation; headache was more frequent in patients with cortical infarcts and in patients with infarcts in the posterior circulation. Patients with a relevant small deep infarct on computed tomographic scan and accompanying headache relatively often reported symptoms compatible with cortical ischemia, such as language disorders or a visual field defect. We conclude that headache is a frequent accompanying symptom in patients with acute cerebral and retinal ischemia and that the occurrence of headache is partly related to the underlying cause of the ischemic lesion. \nArteriovenous malformation in meningothelial meningioma: case report. An unusual association of a meningioma and an arteriovenous malformation is reported. A 68-year-old man developed left homonymous hemianopsia, left hemiparesis, and gaze palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a right occipital mass lesion containing multiple signal-void areas with tubular and honeycomb appearance, suggesting a marked vascular component. An angiogram showed abnormal vasculature in the mass supplied by the posterior cerebral artery and a dural arteriovenous malformation on the tentorium. Neuropathological examination after total removal of the mass revealed a meningothelial meningioma including major portions of an arteriovenous malformation that extended from the dura and leptomeninges, through the meningioma, and into the occipital lobe, where the tumor was located. \nPrognostic significance of the Karnofsky Performance Status score in patients with acute myocardial infarction: comparison with the left ventricular ejection fraction and the exercise treadmill test performance. The MILIS Study Group. The prognostic significance of functional status has not been previously studied in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. We assessed the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score, a simple functional status scale that is commonly used to categorize physical ability, in 849 patients with acute myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the Multicenter Investigation of the Limitation of Infarct Size (MILIS) study. We then compared the KPS score with other predictors of prognosis in these patients. In patients who presented with acute myocardial infarction, a lower KPS score (less than 8 on a scale of 1 to 10) 3 weeks before the index infarction was associated with a higher incidence of congestive heart failure, in-hospital cardiac arrest, and mortality during hospitalization, as compared with patients with KPS scores greater than or equal to 8 (each p less than 0.001). Cumulative 1-year and 4-year mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with KPS scores less than 8, as compared with patients with KPS scores greater than or equal to 8 (42.5% vs. 12.6% at 1 year and 61.6% vs 25.1% at 4 years, respectively; both p less than 0.001). The left ventricular ejection fraction on admission was significantly lower in patients with KPS scores less than 8, as compared with those with KPS scores greater than or equal to 8 (p less than 0.019). The cumulative mortality rate was equally well predicted by low KPS score and by left ventricular ejection fraction (both p less than 0.0001). \nCerebrovascular disease in hypertensive blacks. There is convincing evidence that all grades of persistent diastolic hypertension, especially in blacks, should be treated in order to prevent stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Studies are now in progress to gather additional information concerning isolated systolic hypertension, especially in the aged. Inasmuch as at least one half or more of stroke deaths in blacks develop as the result of hypertension, lowering blood pressure offers the perfect opportunity to reduce considerably the frequency of this devastating illness. The recent dramatic fall in U.S. stroke mortality, greatest in the black female, is a commendable achievement, but the flattening of the declining mortality curve over the past several years should be a cause for alarm and intensive investigation. \nChoroidal detachment associated with malignant choroidal tumors. The association of choroidal detachment with malignant choroidal tumors is not well recognized. The authors' experience with six cases suggests that choroidal detachment may be associated with both metastatic tumors and choroidal melanoma. In two of these cases, the choroidal or retinal detachment was so massive that echography was necessary to detect the underlying tumor. Three patients presented with painful visual loss, and three patients presented with painless visual loss or a visual field defect. In one patient, the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the choroidal metastasis with external radiation relieved the patient's pain and improved visual acuity from 1/200 to 20/35. Metastatic and primary uveal malignant tumors should be added to the list of causes of choroidal detachment and can be excluded only after thorough clinical, and often echographic, examination. \nCoronary risk factors and the postbypass patient. Atherosclerosis frequently develops in SVGs during the first 10 years. This process appears related to coronary risk factors. Several studies have found an association between hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis documented at pathology. Late changes attributed to atherosclerosis that were observed at angiography were also significantly related to elevated serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides. They also were found in association with diabetes, systemic hypertension, and smoking in some studies. Several clinical studies have documented an association of one or several coronary risk factors with postoperative clinical events, including recurrence of angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, reoperation because of clinical deterioration, and survival. These factors have been shown to act alone or in combination. The most important is an abnormal lipid profile and diabetes. Smoking and hypertension were seldom found to be significant predictors when considered separately, but appear to play an important role in association with the others. Control of coronary risk factors, particularly hyperlipidemia and smoking, seems mandatory in order to prevent SVG atherosclerosis and progression of the disease in the native coronary arteries. \nShort-term effect of dynamic exercise on arterial blood pressure BACKGROUND. To quantify the duration of postexercise hypotension at different exercise intensities, we studied six unmedicated, mildly hypertensive men matched with six normotensive controls. METHODS AND RESULTS. Each subject wore a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor at the same time of day for 13 consecutive hours on 3 different days. On each of the 3 days, subjects either cycled for 30 minutes at 40% or 70% maximum VO2 or performed activities of daily living. There was no intensity effect on the postexercise reduction in blood pressure, so blood pressure data were combined for the different exercise intensities. Postexercise diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were lower by 8 +/- 1 (p less than 0.001) and 7 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), respectively, than the preexercise values for 12.7 hours in the hypertensive group. These variables were not different before and after exercise in the normotensive group. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 5 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) for 8.7 hours after exercise in the hypertensive group. In contrast, systolic blood pressure was 5 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) higher for 12.7 hours after exercise in the normotensive group. When the blood pressure response on the exercise days was compared with that on the nonexercise day, systolic blood pressure (135 +/- 1 versus 145 +/- 1 mm Hg) and mean arterial pressure (100 +/- 1 versus 106 +/- 1 mm Hg) were lower (p less than 0.05) on the exercise days in the hypertensive but not in the normotensive group. We found a postexercise reduction in mean arterial pressure for 12.7 hours independent of the exercise intensity in the hypertensive group. Furthermore, mean arterial pressure was lower on exercise than on nonexercise days in the hypertensive but not in the normotensive group. CONCLUSION. These findings indicate that dynamic exercise may be an important adjunct in the treatment of mild hypertension. \nThe management of geriatric hypertension in health maintenance organizations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of medical care received by Medicare enrollees with hypertension in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) compared to that received by a similar group of elderly hypertensives in a fee-for-service (FFS) setting. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design was used to study an historical cohort of newly evaluated hypertensive patients over a 2-year period. SETTING: Medicare HMO and FFS practice settings. PARTICIPANTS: Eight Medicare HMOs and 87 FFS primary care physicians in the same communities were selected. A sample of 685 elderly hypertensive patients was studied, 336 in FFS settings and 349 in HMOs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An expert panel of physicians selected standards of care for the management of geriatric hypertension, and medical records were reviewed. The results showed significant differences (P less than 0.01) in recording medications (94.5% HMO versus 88% FFS) and smoking histories (75.8% HMO versus 64.7% FFS), checking orthostatic blood pressures (9.5% HMO versus 3.3% FFS), performing funduscopy (44.4% HMO versus 27% FFS), completing cardiac examinations (90.8% HMO versus 79.8% FFS), and obtaining chest x-rays (72.8% HMO versus 64.3% FFS, P less than 0.05). Treatment and follow-up were similar between the two groups, except that FFS hypertensives were more likely to have medications adjusted and electrolytes ordered. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that elderly hypertensives in HMOs received equal or better quality of care for most criteria compared to elderly hypertensives in FFS settings. \nProarrhythmic response to sodium channel blockade. Theoretical model and numerical experiments. BACKGROUND. The use of flecainide and encainide was terminated in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial because of an excess of sudden cardiac deaths in the active treatment group. Such events might arise from reentrant rhythms initiated by premature stimulation in the presence of anisotropic sodium channel availability. Drugs that bind to sodium channels increase the functional dispersion of refractoriness by slowing (a result of the drug-unbinding process) the transition from an inexcitable state to an excitable state. It is interesting that encainide and flecainide unbind slowly (15-20 seconds), whereas lidocaine and moricizine unbind rapidly (0.2-1.3 seconds). METHODS AND RESULTS. With a computer representation of a cable with Beeler-Reuter membrane properties, we found a small (6 msec) vulnerable window that occurred 338 msec after the last drive stimulus. Premature stimuli falling within the vulnerable window resulted in unidirectional block and reentrant activation. In the presence of a slowly unbinding drug, the window was delayed an additional 341 msec, and its duration was extended to 38 msec. The delay (antiarrhythmic effect) before the onset of the vulnerable window and its duration (proarrhythmic effect) were both dependent on the sodium channel availability and the recovery process. Both effects were also prolonged when sodium channel availability was reduced by membrane depolarization. Defining the proarrhythmic potential as the duration of the vulnerable window, we found that hypothetical use-dependent class I drugs have a greater proarrhythmic potential than non-use-dependent drugs. CONCLUSIONS. The antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic properties of pure sodium channel antagonists are both dependent on sodium channel availability. Consequently, the price for increased antiarrhythmic efficacy (suppressed premature ventricular contractions) is an increased proarrhythmic vulnerability to unsuppressed premature ventricular contractions. \nComparison of chlorambucil and prednisone versus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone as initial treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: long-term follow-up of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group randomized clinical trial. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a study in which patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were randomized between a regimen consisting of chlorambucil (30 mg/m2 orally day 1) and prednisone (80 mg orally days 1 to 5) (C + P) administered every 2 weeks and a more intensive regimen of cyclosphosphamide (300 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 5), vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] day 1), and prednisone (100 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 5) (CVP) given every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued for up to 18 months to maximal response. Of the 122 eligible patients, 60 received C + P, while 62 received CVP. With a median follow-up of 7 years, there were no significant differences in survival (4.8 v 3.9 years, P = .12), complete remission (CR) rate (25% v 23%; P = .83), or duration of response (2.0 v 1.9 years; P = .78) between C + P and CVP. Toxicity was modest despite the prolonged treatment. The long median survival of 4.1 years for stage III and IV patients is superior to that usually reported. This could stem from continuing treatment to maximal response rather than an increase in intensity of therapy. These results are comparable to those reported with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) therapy by other investigators. The data suggest that intermittent C + P administered to maximal response continues to be the standard treatment approach for advanced CLL. \nImpact of changing attitudes in carotid surgery on community hospital practice. In 1985, institutional guidelines for the evaluation and performance of carotid surgery were established in our community hospital. During the 5-year period from 1985 through 1989, 159 carotid reconstructions were done. There were four major strokes (3%), one eventually resulting in death, with the second death in this series from a myocardial infarction (mortality 1%). The combined mortality/major stroke morbidity incidence was 3%. Three transient ischemic attacks (2%) postoperatively cleared promptly without residua. During the latter 1980s, an increasing number of vascular surgeons were doing less carotid surgery. Monitoring institutional quality assurance and individual surgeon performance within the community hospital is becoming a reality. Our experience with institutional guidelines for the evaluation and conduct of carotid surgery, together with an assessment of results and ongoing individual surgeon performance, is presented. Maintaining acceptable morbidity and mortality statistics can be enhanced by having a plan for assessment, management, and concurrent review. \nClonal analysis of T-cell deficiencies in autotransplant recipients. We have used limiting dilution culture methods to determine the frequency of mitogen-responsive T cells in peripheral blood of patients after bone marrow autotransplantation, and have compared their responsiveness to that of allotransplant recipients and normal controls. Autotransplant patients were found to have low responder cell frequencies in tests for lymphokine-secreting helper function, and for IL-2 dependent proliferator and cytotoxic function. Multiple regression analysis showed that function was lower in autotransplant patients than in allorecipients, and lower in male patients for all three functional assays. Patients with clinically significant infection tended to have lower proliferative function in both transplant groups and lower cytotoxic function in the allotransplant population. Graft-versus-host disease was associated with lower T-cell function, but was present only in the allotransplant group; therefore, it cannot account for the even lower levels of function observed in the autotransplant population. Because we observe deficits in T-cell regeneration in autotransplant recipients that are even more severe than in allorecipients, we postulate that cellular immunodeficiency after bone marrow transplantation may reflect limitations in thymic-dependent repopulation rather than an effect of genetic disparity between host and donor (eg, clinical or subclinical graft-versus-host). \nNecrotizing bronchial aspergillosis in a patient receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung carcinoma. We describe a case of necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis which developed after lobectomy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a 73-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer. The lesion was visualized and biopsied through FBS, which played a useful role for early diagnosis of this disease. Itraconazole therapy was effective and safe. \nChoriocarcinoma of the testis metastatic to the skin. A case of choriocarcinoma of the testis metastatic to the skin is reported. In this case report the primary tumor was first diagnosed by the histopathologic findings in the cutaneous biopsy of a single nodule that appeared on the chest, with both syncytiotrophoblastic and cytotrophoblastic cells in the metastatic solid tumor islands. Using peroxidase-antiperoxidase techniques, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) was positive within the cytoplasm of syncytiotrophoblastic cells. The patient was treated with orchiectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. With these measures there was a decrease of chorionic gonadotropin serum levels to normal limits and 2 years after this treatment there is no evidence of recurrence. \nCor triatriatum dexter: recognition and percutaneous transluminal correction. Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital anomaly in which an obstructive membrane is located in the right atrium. The detection usually occurs after the sequelae of systemic congestion, coagulopathy, and hepatic dysfunction have set in, leading up to a high surgical risk. A percutaneous balloon correction of cor triatriatum dexter in a patient with advanced right-sided congestive symptoms and hepatic dysfunction is presented. This efficacious method is an alternative to surgical correction and could be extended to the more common cor triatriatum sinistra. \nRenal cell carcinoma involving penis and testis: unusual initial presentations of metastatic disease. Solitary parenchymal metastases of renal cell carcinoma to the penis or testis are rare. We report 1 case of each: in one instance the patient presented with priapism and an asymptomatic primary tumor; in the other, the metastasis presented as an acute change in a long-standing hydrocele more than one year after nephrectomy. Both patients had either positive margins at resection or recurrence after resection of the metastasis. While long-term, disease-free survival has been reported after orchiectomy for isolated metastatic disease, penile involvement appears to carry a very poor prognosis. \nIntratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity in a benign neoplasm. Cytogenetic findings are reported in a 64-year-old man who had a history of rapid growth of a mass in the left groin area. The histopathologic diagnosis of the tumor was consistent with that of a lipoma with atypia. Cytogenetic analysis was done on an incisional biopsy specimen. The initial biopsy specimen revealed, in addition to normal cells, three different clones: 46,XY,t(12;21)(q13;q21), 46,XY, t(2;12)(q11.2'1.2), t(19;20)(q13.1'3), and 47.XY,+ r. The subsequently excised specimen showed a normal male karyotype (46,XY) and a predominant clone with the karyotype, 47,XY,t(2;12)(q11.2'1.2),t(3;11)(p24'5), + r. One cell with 47,XY, + r was present. In addition, polyploid cells with large markers, rings, and a high frequency of telomeric associations were also observed. \nPossible involvement of inositol-lipid metabolism in malignant hyperthermia. Alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation may induce malignant hyperthermia (MH) in vivo. Consequently, we have investigated the effects of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine and, for comparison, the effects of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol on inositol-lipid metabolism of malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) and healthy control (MHN) swine. The experiments were performed on electrically stimulated (frequency 0.2 Hz) trabeculae isolated from the right ventricles of the hearts of MHS and MHN animals. After labelling with [3H]inositol for 6 h, different inositol phosphates were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography, including inositol 1-phosphate, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. After stimulation with isoproterenol, the inositol phosphate content did not increase or vary between muscle from MHS and MHN animals. In contrast, all inositol phosphates increased after stimulation with phenylephrine in both muscle types, the effects being greater in MHS than in MHN, especially as regards 1,4,5-IP3 content. As 1,4,5-IP3, a presumed second messenger, has been shown to mobilize intracellular calcium, it is concluded that an enhanced alpha-adrenergic response is involved in the development of MH. \nUsefulness of high-frequency analysis of signal-averaged surface electrocardiograms in acute myocardial infarction before and after coronary thrombolysis for assessing coronary reperfusion. The incidence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram before and after coronary thrombolysis was studied in 54 patients with an acute myocardial infarction of less than or equal to 5 hours' duration and with an angiographically documented total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery on admission. A significant (p = 0.038) 50% relative reduction in the incidence of late potentials was observed in the group of 35 patients who underwent reperfusion: from 16 of 35 (46%) before to 8 of 35 (23%) at 120 minutes after the start of thrombolytic treatment. No significant reduction was seen in the 19 patients in whom thrombolysis was unsuccessful: from 8 of 19 (42%) before to 7 of 19 (37%) afterward. Despite successful recanalization, late potentials persisted or newly developed after thrombolytic therapy in 8 of 54 patients (15%). It is concluded that successful thrombolysis reduces the incidence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram but that the sensitivity and specificity of this finding are not high enough to allow reliable monitoring of coronary reperfusion at the bedside. \nThe use of soap and water in two Bangladeshi communities: implications for the transmission of diarrhea. Efforts to reduce the incidence of diarrheal infections in which enteropathogens are endemic have focused on education about the importance of hand washing to interrupt transmission of such organisms. Since the effectiveness of health education depends on an understanding of the recipients' ideas and customs, we studied perceptions of cleanliness and the role of soap and hand washing in two poor Bangladeshi communities, one rural and one urban. We found that ideas about cleanliness generally are not based on germ theory; cleanliness is viewed in a larger, socioreligious context of purity vs. impurity. Washing serves both physical and spiritual needs and is performed according to defined patterns that may not effectively interrupt transmission of microorganisms. Soap is regarded as a cosmetic rather than an agent for removal of microorganisms. \nTranscatheter occlusion of pulmonary arterial circulation and collateral supply: failures, incidents, and complications. Failures and complications were analyzed retrospectively in 45 patients treated with embolotherapy or occlusion of pulmonary arterial circulation. Pulmonary arterial branches were occluded with steel coils in 19 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, 17 with hemoptysis of pulmonary artery (PA) origin, and one with massive parenchymal shunt. Bronchial arterial supply to the lung was embolized with small particles in eight cases of hemoptysis and systemic to pulmonary arterial antegrade shunt secondary to chronic thromboembolism. Asymptomatic incidents included catheterization failures, vascular damage, partial occlusion, partial recanalization of the thrombus, ectopic deposition of a coil, and delayed bacterial contamination of the thrombus. A few cases of transient clinical and radiologic signs of pulmonary infarction were observed after complete occlusion of the PA and bronchial artery embolization. This complication was never observed after complete occlusion of main right or left PA, inferior right or left PA, or segmental branches. The management and prevention of these complications, the role of bronchial arterial collateral pathways, and the importance of the site of PA occlusion in the development of pulmonary infarction are discussed. \nEffect of aspirin on heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty in men who have osteoarthrosis. The severity of heterotopic ossification was determined from the radiographs of eighty-three men in whom osteoarthrosis had been treated with a primary total hip arthroplasty with cement. The medical records of these patients were then reviewed, with the reviewer having no knowledge of the radiographic findings. A similar operative approach and technique had been used in all patients. There was no association between the amount of intraoperative loss of blood or the duration of the operation and the severity of formation of heterotopic bone. The over-all rate of occurrence of heterotopic ossification was 72 per cent. Of the fifty-eight patients who had received aspirin throughout their course in the hospital, two (3 per cent) had severe ectopic ossification (grade III or IV8). In contrast, twelve (48 per cent) of the twenty-five patients who had received no aspirin or in whom aspirin had been discontinued so that anticoagulation could be begun had severe heterotopic ossification. The difference in the severity of the ossification between the two groups is significant (p less than 0.0001). \nInhibition of the metabolism of atrial natriuretic factor causes diuresis and natriuresis in chronic heart failure. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone secreted by the heart that is degraded in vivo by endopeptidase 24:11 (atriopeptidase). UK 69,578 is a novel atriopeptidase inhibitor that raises plasma levels of ANF in animals and normal volunteers, with associated diuresis and natriuresis. This study examines the effects of UK 69,578 in patients with mild heart failure. UK 69,578 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 min in a placebo-controlled, cross-over study to six patients with stable (NYHA Class 2) chronic heart failure. The atriopeptidase inhibitor was well tolerated and no side effects were encountered. Mean baseline plasma ANF was elevated at 88 pg/mL (normal less than 50), and increased 2- to 5-fold after UK 69,578 administration. Plasma ANF did not change significantly following placebo. There was a marked diuresis after UK 69,578 compared to placebo. Urinary sodium excretion doubled for 4 to 6 h, but there was no significant rise in potassium excretion. There was no increase in plasma active renin concentration during the study period. Noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring revealed no significant changes in heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, or echocardiographic left ventricular dimensions. However, invasive measurements using a Swan-Ganz catheter demonstrated falls in mean right atrial and pulmonary artery wedge pressures after UK 69,578. There was no change in cardiac output. Thus, inhibition of endopeptidase 24:11 by UK 69,578 results in significant elevation of plasma ANF, with associated diuresis, natriuresis and venodilatation. The compound was well tolerated in these patients with mild chronic heart failure. \nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma in acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A clinical and pathologic study with results of treatment with radiation. Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma occurs frequently in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Seventeen patients with AIDS and biopsy-proven CNS lymphoma were treated with whole-brain radiation. At presentation, most patients were severely debilitated from previous AIDS-related illnesses. Patients generally had focal neurologic symptoms such as seizures and paralysis. Headaches and mental status changes, often noticed after hospital admission, seldom brought our patients to seek medical attention. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed low-density, contrast-enhancing, mass lesions with variable amounts of peritumor edema. Size, location, and pattern of contrast enhancement of the lesions varied. No specific pattern was seen that could be used to distinguish between CNS lymphoma, toxoplasmosis, or other CNS diseases that occur in patients with AIDS. Biopsy results showed angiocentric, high-grade, large cell tumors with frequent necrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed B-cell phenotype with small amounts of T-cells, presumably reactive. All patients received irradiation to the whole brain with parallel opposed fields. A variety of doses and treatment regimens were used. Mean survival was only 72 days. Survival was longer in patients with higher pretreatment Karnofsky scores. The correlation between dose and survival was not significant. At completion of therapy, most patients showed improvement in Karnofsky score and had partial improvement in neurologic symptoms. CNS lymphomas in patients with AIDS are responsive to radiation. Posttreatment CT scans showed regression of tumors. Autopsy examinations showed regression of tumors, but also showed concurrent CNS infections, AIDS encephalopathy, and radiation-induced changes within the normal CNS tissue. Opportunistic infections rather than cerebral herniation or uncontrolled lymphoma was the most common cause of death. \nGradation of unstable angina based on a sensitive immunoassay for serum creatine kinase MB. A newly developed, highly sensitive immunoassay for creatine kinase MB isoenzyme was evaluated in 68 patients with or without different types of ischaemic heart disease. Patients were classified on the basis of clinical criteria in four groups: no ischaemic heart disease, stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. Enzyme concentration in patients with stable angina was the same (even during exercise) as seen in the patients without ischaemic heart disease. Patients with unstable angina, however, could be divided into two groups. One group showed clear evidence of severe myocardial ischaemia by serial changes and higher mean values of creatine kinase MB up to 40 hours after the onset of symptoms, whereas in the remainder values were stable and resembled those seen in the patients without ischaemic heart disease. The changes in concentration correlated with signs of repetitive ischaemic episodes deduced from continuous ST segment monitoring during the first 24 hours after admission. These findings indicate that patients with unstable angina are a heterogenous group. In some, severe and prolonged ischaemia can be detected by a serological assay with high sensitivity. \nIs it time to use evoked potentials to predict outcome in comatose children and adults? OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of multimodality-evoked potential recordings in predicting outcome in comatose children. DESIGN: Prospective series and literature review. SETTING: Pediatric ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-one children with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 8, who were admitted to the pediatric ICU between 1984 and 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Forty-one patients underwent brainstem auditory-evoked potential testing within 72 hrs of admission. Of these patients, 37 also had somatosensory-evoked potential testing at the same time. Four patients did not receive somatosensory-evoked potential testing for various nonmedical reasons. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multimodality-evoked potential recordings were used to predict outcome in these comatose children. Outcomes were categorized as bad (death or chronic vegetative state) or good (all other outcomes). Survivor outcomes were determined at discharge and on subsequent follow-up visits from 1 to 3 yrs later. There were no false pessimistic predictions, and two false optimistic predictions in this series. A comprehensive literature review of coma outcome prediction, using multimodality-evoked potential recordings, revealed 20 series with 982 additional patients in whom the predictive errors of false optimism and false pessimism could be determined. Five cases of false pessimism and 99 cases of false optimism were identified in the 982 additional patients. If neonates are excluded, the false pessimism number is reduced to three. CONCLUSIONS: A bad outcome can be reliably predicted using multimodality-evoked potential recordings with little chance of a false pessimistic prediction. The acceptable error of false optimism occurs frequently, since patients often die of progressive neurologic and nonneurologic problems that may or may not be present at the time of the evoked potential recordings. Thus, in comatose children, multimodality-evoked potential recordings are a useful adjunct to clinical examination and other diagnostic aids in predicting outcome and in making decisions regarding the degree of intervention to offer. \nPrevention of chronic erosive streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis in rats by treatment with a monoclonal antibody against the T cell antigen receptor alpha beta. Rats treated with an mAb (R73) against the TCR-alpha beta failed to develop chronic persistent arthritis after injection of streptococcal cell walls. Histologically, R73 mAb-treated rats had mild hyperplasia of synovial lining cells and minimal destruction of cartilage. In contrast, control-treated animals developed marked pannus formation, with pronounced infiltration of mononuclear cells and severe destruction of cartilage and subchondral bone. The preventive effect of R73 mAb on streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis was associated with the marked depletion of alpha beta + T cells by R73 mAb. These results indicate that T cells play a crucial role in chronic erosive streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis. \nHypertrophy of nodules of Arantius and aortic insufficiency: pathophysiology and repair. Aortic insufficiency (AI) due to fibrosis and thickening of the nodules of Arantius in the otherwise normal aortic valve was found in 11 adults (age range, 41 to 65 years) between 1976 and 1988. Nine had concomitant mitral stenosis; 2 had coronary artery disease. In 6 patients AI was graded 3+ or greater; in 5 it was less than 3+. Correction of AI and restoration of cuspid flexibility and apposition by shaving the hypertrophied nodules was accomplished in all, with postrepair AI graded as 1+ or less. There was one hospital death, a patient who had prior mitral operation. Mean follow-up was 68 +/- 56 months. Only 1 patient had late (6 years) recurrent serious (3+) AI. Nine continued to have 1+ or less AI, based on echocardiography or catheterization (n = 6) or on physical examination performed at a mean of 74 months. We conclude that thickening of the nodules of Arantius may cause AI. Long-term correction can be accomplished by sculpturing of the involved cusps. \nThe consistency of pulse frequencies and pulse patterns of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) used by chronic pain patients. This study records the consistency of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) pulse frequency and pulse pattern used by 13 chronic patients over a 1 year period. The results show that patients prefer specific pulse frequencies and pulse patterns unique to the individual and that they turn to such frequencies and patterns on subsequent treatment sessions. Pulse frequencies and pulse patterns were not related to the cause and site of pain, a finding consistent with previous study in this laboratory. This observation, coupled with the large variability in pulse frequencies and pulse patterns used between individuals, implies that patients prefer such frequencies and patterns for reasons of comfort which may not be related to mechanisms specific to the pain system. \nTuberculosis of the pancreas: report of three cases. Three cases of pancreatic tuberculosis are described. The first patient presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, anorexia, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and mass in the head of the pancreas, on computerized tomographic (CT) scan. The second patient presented with low grade fever, anorexia, and weight loss, and was investigated for gallbladder disease. The third patient presented with obstructive jaundice and mass lesion in the head of the pancreas. Two patients underwent laparotomy for suspected pancreatic tumors. The findings of pancreatic disease was incidental during laparotomy in the second patient. The histopathology revealed caseating granuloma in all of them. The first patient responded well to treatment, and the second patient stopped treatment after 2 months and is well. The third patient is being followed. If malignancy can be ruled out, tuberculosis should be considered in relevant geographic areas, and a tissue diagnosis should be made. \nMyocardial infarction: assessment with an intravascular MR contrast medium. Work in progress. The effect of a new intravascular magnetic resonance (MR) contrast medium (gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid [DTPA] polylysine) was evaluated in acute, subacute, and chronic myocardial infarctions in rats. Signal intensity (SI) was measured before and after intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA polylysine. Before administration of contrast material, chronic infarctions had lower SI than normal myocardium. With Gd-DTPA polylysine, three zones were identified in acute and subacute stages of myocardial infarction, but in the chronic stage, images demonstrated two zones. In acute and subacute infarctions, Gd-DTPA polylysine produced greater enhancement (over 60 minutes) in the peri-infarction zone than in the normal or infarcted myocardium. In chronic infarctions, Gd-DTPA polylysine had no discernible effect on the SI of the central infarction zone. Overall, it caused no significant hemodynamic effects. MR imaging with Gd-DTPA polylysine produced differential tissue enhancement in myocardial infarctions, which varied according to the age of the infarction. \nAluminium sulphate in water in north Cornwall and outcome of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the excess aluminum sulphate accidentally added to the local water supply in north Cornwall in July 1988 had an adverse effect on the outcome of pregnancies. DESIGN--Outcomes of all singleton pregnancies in the affected area at the time of the incident (n = 92) were compared with those in two control groups: pregnancies in this area completed before the incident (n = 68) and pregnancies in a neighbouring area (n = 193). SUBJECTS--Mothers in the three groups, among whom there were 13 miscarriages, five terminations of pregnancy, and 336 live births. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Fetal and perinatal loss, birth weight, gestation, obstetric complications, neonatal condition, and congenital defects. RESULTS--Among 88 pregnancies in women exposed to excess aluminum sulphate there was no excess of perinatal deaths (n = 0), low birthweight (n = 3), preterm delivery (n = 4), or severe congenital malformations (n = 0). There was, however, an increased rate of talipes in exposed fetuses (four cases, one control; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS--Because of small numbers it is not possible to say that high doses of aluminum sulphate are safe in pregnancy, but there is no evidence from this study of major problems apparent at birth. \nAcute cardiogenic pulmonary edema treated with mechanical ventilation. Factors determining in-hospital mortality. We reviewed 88 episodes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) treated with mechanical ventilation to define the clinical features that predict in-hospital mortality. Fifty-six patients survived to hospital discharge. APACHE II scores were not helpful in prediction. Multiple logistic regression models to predict outcome were developed using variables present at the time of intubation and 24 hours later. The model at the time of intubation indicated mortality was related to systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg, the presence of anterior myocardial infarction, use of calcium channel blockers, age, and absence of prior hospitalization for CPE. A model using additional variables available 24 hours later showed that mortality was related only to the need for vasopressor medication at 24 hours, and systolic blood pressure at intubation less than 130 mm Hg. The predictive power of these models was confirmed by applying them to 46 additional patients. The variables contained in these models suggest that the prognosis of patients with CPE treated with mechanical ventilation depends primarily on the severity of acute left ventricular injury. Variables relating the degree of respiratory failure, however, were not predictive of mortality. These multiple logistic regression models provide a means to compare patients with CPE for quality assessment purposes and for studies of treatment regimens, and may also provide information useful to patient and family counseling regarding the value of continued aggressive intensive care. \nIntra- and interindividual variability of glucose tolerance in an elderly population. The intra- and interindividual variability of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and other risk factors was investigated in 237 subjects, aged 64-87, examined annually in the period 1971-1975. Coefficients of intraindividual variation (CVa) were calculated from individual regressions on time. The lowest CVa was found for the summary index including fasting glucose (area under the curve, AUC): 10.0 +/- 4.9%. For fasting and 30, 60, and 120 min glucose the values ranged from 12 to 18%. The CVa's were not associated with age, gender, drug use, and disease prevalence, and may also be applied to other populations. The reliability coefficient depended on the prevalence of diabetes in the population and was higher than observed in younger populations. The highest reliability coefficient was observed for AUC: 0.81. For the combined information of OGTT, reflected by AUC or by classification according to WHO criteria, the variability was comparable to that of other cardiovascular risk factors such as serum total cholesterol. \nTolerance to intravenous nitroglycerin in patients with congestive heart failure: role of increased intravascular volume, neurohumoral activation and lack of prevention with N-acetylcysteine To better understand the mechanism of nitrate tolerance in patients with congestive heart failure, 13 patients received a 24 h infusion of nitroglycerin (1.5 micrograms/kg body weight per min) with or without N-acetylcysteine (225 mg/kg per 24 h). The infusions were separated by a 24 h nitrate-free interval. By the end of the nitroglycerin infusion, mean arterial pressure had returned to baseline values and there was a significant increase in ventricular filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance compared with values after 1 h of treatment. The simultaneous infusion of N-acetylcysteine had no effect on these changes. Although a strict fluid restriction of 1.5 liters/day was maintained for 1 week before and throughout the study, after 24 h of nitroglycerin infusion there was a significant and similar degree of hemodilution whether nitroglycerin was infused alone (9.1 +/- 4.3%) or with N-acetylcysteine (8.7 +/- 4.1%). This hemodilution corresponded to an increase in intravascular volume of 745 +/- 382 ml, most of which occurred during the 1st h. Plasma renin activity increased and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide decreased during the infusion. The results of this study suggest that nitrate tolerance is multifactorial. In addition to the previously described pharmacologic tolerance to the effect of nitroglycerin on vascular smooth muscle, a capillary fluid shift from the extravascular to intravascular space appears to be involved, especially during the 1st h of the infusion. A third mechanism, reflex neurohumoral activation, also seems to contribute to the genesis of nitroglycerin tolerance. \nA new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia. A new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia is described, based upon the demonstration of a fall in the intramural pH of the small bowel after introduction of a test meal into the stomach. Intramural pH (pHI) is determined indirectly by tonometry, utilizing a tonometer passed per os. Postoperative assessment of revascularization procedures is also possible by the same technique. Application of the test in an 84-yr-old woman showed good correlation between a preoperative fall in jejunal intramural pH and abdominal pain, and the absence of a fall postoperatively after successful revascularization. \nHigh dietary linoleic acid affects the fatty acid compositions of individual phospholipids from tissues of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): association with stress susceptibility and cardiac lesion. For 16 wk Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts were fed practical-type diets that contained either fish oil (FO) or sunflower oil (SO) as the lipid component. Both diets contained adequate (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). All the phospholipids of heart and liver from SO-fed fish had increased levels of 18:2(n-6), 20:2(n-6) and 20:3(n-6); phosphatidyl choline (PC) and phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) also had increased 20:4(n-6). There was a general decrease in 20:5(n-3) in the phospholipids, reflected in an increase in the 20:4(n-6)/20:5(n-3) ratio, especially in PC and PE. The fatty acid compositions of phospholipids from brain and retina were much less affected by dietary linoleate than those of heart and liver. Fish fed SO developed severe heart lesions that caused thinning of the ventricular wall and muscle necrosis. The fish fed SO also were susceptible to a transportation-induced shock syndrome that caused 30% mortality. These results establish that a diet with a low (n-3)/(n-6) ratio can cause changes in fatty acid metabolism that are deleterious to the health of salmonid fish, especially when subjected to stress. \nMolecular heterogeneity and cellular localization of carboxypeptidase H in the islets of Langerhans. The intracellular distribution and molecular heterogeneity of carboxypeptidase H was studied in rat insulinoma tissue and isolated islets of Langerhans by a combination of immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, subcellular fractionation, and immunoblotting analyses. Immunofluorescence microscopy of islets demonstrated the presence of carboxypeptidase H in both insulin-containing B cells and glucagon-containing A cells. Quantitative ultrastructural analyses of islet B cells indicated that the enzyme was concentrated in mature insulin secretory granules, clathrin-coated condensing granules, and to a lesser extent the Golgi apparatus. Carboxypeptidase H activity was localized principally to secretory granule subfractions of insulinoma tissue, where it was present for the major part (70%) as a form which is readily solubilizable at pH values prevailing in the granule interior (5.5). This species migrated as a diffuse band of 53-57 kilodaltons (kDa) on immunoblot analysis using antisera raised against the purified native enzyme. In contrast, the insoluble form which was associated with the granule membrane at pH 5.5, migrated as a relatively compact band of 55-57 kDa. Carboxypeptidase H activity was also present in subcellular fractions which contained Golgi membranes together with elements of the endoplasmic reticulum, and in a low density secretory granule fraction which may represent immature granules. The enzyme in these compartments, like the granule membrane species, migrated as a compact 55-57 kDa band on immunoblots. Two-dimensional electrophoretic immunoblot analysis of secretory granules suggested that both membrane and soluble forms of the enzyme were glycoproteins and that the terminal glycosylation was similar in both instances. Antiserum raised against the deduced C-terminal 11 amino acids of the cloned carboxypeptidase H sequence recognized the 55-57 kDa membrane component in granules but did not react with the 53-57 kDa soluble species. A major difference between the soluble and membrane forms therefore appears to be a structural modification or proteolytic removal of the C-terminal domain in the trans-Golgi or early secretory granule compartment. The concept that proteolysis is involved is further supported by the observation that the relative proportion of the high and low mol wt forms of the enzyme in different subcellular fractions correlated with that of proinsulin and insulin, respectively. The membrane association of the 55-57 kDa form of carboxypeptidase H is disrupted at pH values of 9 and is dependent on ionic strength. This further suggests that the C-terminus of the protein may have an important role in the sorting or concentration of the enzyme in vesicular elements of the regulated pathway of secretion. \nRelation of stenosis morphology and clinical presentation to the procedural results of directional coronary atherectomy BACKGROUND. Directional coronary atherectomy has recently become available to treat coronary stenoses. This study was performed to determine the relation of patient characteristics and stenosis morphology to procedural outcome with directional coronary atherectomy to gain insight into which patients might be best treated with this device. METHODS AND RESULTS. Four hundred stenoses from 378 patients consecutively treated at six major referral institutions were analyzed. Angiographic data were assessed at a central angiographic laboratory using standardized morphological criteria and computer-assisted quantitative dimensional analyses. Procedural success was achieved in 87.8% of stenoses, and major ischemic complications (death, myocardial infarction, and emergency bypass surgery) occurred in 6.3% of patients. Lesion success and complications were closely correlated with recognized modified American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force lesion morphological criteria. Observed for type A stenoses were 93% success and 3% complication rates; for type B1 stenoses, 88% success and 6% complication rates; and for type B2 stenoses, 75% success and 13% complication rates, respectively. There were too few type C stenoses treated to analyze. Furthermore, multivariate testing demonstrated stenosis angulation (multivariate p less than 0.001), proximal tortuosity (p less than 0.001), decreased preatherectomy minimum lumen dimension (p = 0.032), and calcification (p = 0.041) to correlate independently with adverse outcome and complex, probably thrombus-associated stenoses to have a favorable outcome (p = 0.055). Operator experience (p = 0.020) and a history of restenosis (p = 0.022) also favorably influenced outcome. CONCLUSIONS. The procedural outcome of directional coronary atherectomy is highly associated with coronary stenosis morphology. Furthermore, after appropriate stratification for morphology and clinical presentation, overall atherectomy procedural outcome may be similar to that achieved with coronary angioplasty. However, specific subsets of patients may have relatively better outcome with either atherectomy or balloon angioplasty. \nThrough a looking glass. A new technique to demonstrate directional hypokinesia in unilateral neglect. A line cancellation task was performed by right brain-damaged patients with neglect in two response conditions. The task was presented either in normal view or through a 90 degree angle mirror with direct view prevented. The latter decouples the direction of visual attention and of arm movement. In the mirror condition, 4 of 18 patients cancelled lines only in right hemispace which means that they directed their visual attention to the left but failed to execute movements towards contralateral hemispace--what has been termed directional hypokinesia. In contrast, 10 patients cancelled lines only in left hemispace in the mirror condition, which accords better with attention-representation deficit hypotheses. Our results support a division of the neglect syndrome according to whether perceptual or premotor deficits are predominant. \nMalignant peritoneal mesothelioma in childhood with long-term survival. A diffuse, well-differentiated, malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) developed in a nine-year-old girl. She received limited chemotherapy and radiation therapy and is alive and well without clinical evidence of disease 109 months after diagnosis. The neoplastic cells stained immunohistochemically for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen but were unreactive with B72.3, anti-carcinoembryonic antigen, and anti-Leu-M1. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells had abundant desmosomes, numerous tonofilament bundles, and variable-length microvilli. These findings confirm the mesothelial nature of the cells. Features consistent with malignancy included DNA aneuploidy by flow cytometric analysis and diffuse peritoneal involvement. The three previously described survivors with MPM were also premenarchal girls. Some MPMs in premenarchal girls have an indolent biologic behavior similar to that of low-grade peritoneal serous neoplasia or well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma in adult women. \nValve-related complications with the Hancock I porcine bioprosthesis. A twelve- to fourteen-year follow-up study. Valve-related morbidity and mortality after heart valve replacement with the Hancock I porcine bioprosthesis has been retrospectively analyzed. From June 1974 through December 1976, 253 Hancock I bioprostheses (150 mitral and 103 aortic) were inserted in 220 selected patients who survived the operation and had follow-up until June 1989 (mean follow-up 13.5 years, with an accumulative follow-up of 2956.4 patient-years). One hundred seventeen patients had mitral valve replacement, 70 had aortic valve replacement, and 33 had combined mitral and aortic valve replacement. There were 27 thromboembolic events. The probability of being free from thromboembolism at 14 years was 81.0% +/- 7.4% for the mitral valve replacement group, 85.4% +/- 6.7% for the aortic group, and 67.1% +/- 18.4% for the mitral-aortic group. Fifteen episodes of prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred. There were 10 instances of nonstructural dysfunction (paravalvular leaks) in seven mitral valves (4.6%) and in three aortic valves (2.9%). One hundred twenty-two bioprostheses in 106 patients resulted in structural deterioration. The probability of freedom from structural deterioration at 14 years was 37.2% +/- 3.9% for the mitral group, 43.9% +/- 7.1% for the aortic group, and 30.1% +/- 8.9% for the mitral-aortic group. The logistic regression analysis between age at the time of operation and bioprosthetic life (structural deterioration-free period) de",
