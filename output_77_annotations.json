        "text": "oth Asian men and women had more frequent hospital admissions, but similar levels of out-patient attendance. Body mass index, blood pressure and shoulder joint range of movement were similar for both Asians and the indigenous population. Asian subjects had significantly lower peak expiratory flow rates and hand grip strength. Asian elders have a higher risk of chronic diseases, but the impact of disease (indicated by life satisfaction, mood, and common disabilities) is less than among the indigenous population. Lower peak expiratory flow rates and grip strength among Asian elders are of concern since they may lead to premature arrival at age-related thresholds of physical capacity essential for independence in activities of daily living. \nAbrupt vessel closure following platelet transfusion post-PTCA. A successful PTCA was complicated by abrupt closure following a platelet transfusion which was given for control of local bleeding. Possible mechanisms of abrupt closure are discussed. Recommendation is made to avoid giving platelet transfusion following PTCA. \nWhy all placentas should be examined by a pathologist in 1990 Placental pathology is rarely a part of the training for either obstetrician or pathologist. As a result there has been confusion regarding the potential benefits of routine placental examination. These benefits include clarification of the causes of many adverse pregnancy outcomes, improvement of the risk assessment for future pregnancies, and ascertainment of newborn risk for long-term neurodevelopment sequelae. Information on placental abnormalities may reveal the presence of chronic fetal insults and allow their differentiation from acute (peripartum) stresses. Current methods of risk assessment fail to identify the majority of pregnancies that end in prematurity, stillbirth, growth retardation, or fetal distress. We suggest that placental pathology should be a routine component of obstetric-neonatal care. \nGaze-dependent hemianopia without hemispatial neglect. A hemispheric field is the space defined by the midsagittal plane of the body. Hemianopia, in the absence of hemispheric spatial neglect, has been thought to be purely retinotopic. Confrontation testing of visual fields in eccentric positions of gaze in hemianopic patients permits the discrimination of hemispheric from retinotopic deficits. In the primary position of gaze, a patient with an ischemic lesion of the right occipital and temporal lobes, who was without unilateral spatial neglect, was unable to detect finger movement, name objects, or identify shapes or colors in the left retinotopic hemifield, but when gazing 30 degrees to the right (so that the left retinotopic field was in the right hemispheric field), he performed nearly as well in the left retinotopic field as in the right. The mechanism of this gaze-dependent hemifield visual impairment is unknown, but we discuss four possibilities: (1) eccentric gaze enhances an alternative visual system; (2) the lesion led to modality-specific hemispheric inattention that was corrected by directing intention (plan to act) and gazing to the right; (3) the lesion led to modality specific inattention that was corrected by compensatory mechanisms that may normally enhance attentive vigilance in central space during eccentric gaze; and (4) the neuronal substrate for hemispheric vision was destroyed, whereas that for retinotopic vision was preserved. \nCoronary heart disease risk markers in users of low-dose oral contraceptives. Seven combination oral contraceptives (OCs) were studied for their effects on glucose, insulin, triglyceride and lipoprotein concentrations. Subjects included 925 women using fixed-dose (monophasic) or variable-dose (triphasic) formulations and 418 premenopausal women not using OCs. The monophasics contained 150 or 250 micrograms of levonorgestrel, 500 or 1,000 micrograms of norethindrone or 150 micrograms of desogestrel as the progestin. Triphasic progestin doses were 50-125 micrograms of levonorgestrel or 500-1,000 micrograms of norethindrone. All the formulations increased the fasting serum triglycerides. No changes were seen in serum total cholesterol. The effects on serum lipoproteins depended on the progestin type and dose. Monophasics containing 500 micrograms of norethindrone or 150 micrograms of desogestrel lowered low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Monophasics containing levonorgestrel reduced HDL cholesterol. The triphasics did not affect LDL or HDL cholesterol but altered the balance of HDL subfractions. All the formulations caused a deterioration in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance and increased pancreatic insulin secretion. The greatest effects were seen with formulations containing levonorgestrel. The study showed that a reduction in the progestin dose and use of novel progestins can reduce the potentially adverse effects of OCs on metabolic risk markers for coronary heart disease. \nMagnetic resonance imaging evaluation of uveal tumors. We detected seven tumors with magnetic resonance imaging, which demonstrate some of the uses and limitations of this diagnostic technique. In one patient, the correct diagnosis of extraocular extension was demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging when both clinical and ultrasonographic data were not diagnostic. In another case, an extremely small area of extraocular extension was detected with ultrasound evaluation but was not noted on magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging is highly reliable in the detection of intraocular tumors. In pigmented uveal melanomas it is both sensitive and highly specific. In amelanotic processes magnetic resonance imaging can identify a mass but cannot always adequately characterize it. Further experience will be necessary to determine the proper role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of uveal tumors. \nSocioeconomic status and visual impairment among urban Americans. Baltimore Eye Survey Research Group. The Baltimore Eye Survey is a population-based study of ocular disorders conducted in East Baltimore, Md, designed to determine the prevalence and severity of vision loss and ocular disease and their relationships to socioeconomic and other risk factors. This survey comprised 5300 subjects (2911 whites and 2389 blacks). Visual impairment was associated with age, race, general health status, educational level, income, and employment status. An identified association of race with blindness and visual impairment was reduced, but not eliminated, after adjustment for these socioeconomic factors, indicating that socioeconomic status itself is an important determinant of visual impairment. \nOpen reduction and internal fixation of two-part displaced fractures of the greater tuberosity of the proximal part of the humerus. Twelve patients, ranging in age from thirty-four to seventy-two years (average, fifty-three years), were evaluated an average of five years (range, two to eight years) after open reduction and internal fixation of a two-part displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity of the proximal part of the humerus. The indication for operative reduction was one centimeter or more of displacement of the fracture as seen on the diagnostic radiographs. The anterosuperior deltoid-splitting approach, combined with rotation of the humerus, allowed adequate exposure of the retracted tuberosity. Internal fixation of the greater tuberosity with heavy, non-absorbable sutures and careful repair of the rotator cuff permitted early passive motion. All fractures healed without postoperative displacement. Six patients had an excellent result and six had a good result; active elevation averaged 170 degrees. There was one partial, transient palsy of the axillary nerve. \nSteps towards cost-benefit analysis of regional neurosurgical care OBJECTIVE--To determine the cost of averting death or severe disability by neurosurgical intervention. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of one year's admissions for neurosurgery; comparison of outcome with expected outcome in the absence of neurosurgical intervention and with the cost of neurosurgery. SETTING--Wessex Neurological Centre. PATIENTS--1026 Patients were admitted to the neurosurgical service in 1984. Of 1185 admissions, 978 case records were available and outcome was known in 919. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow outcome scale, modified as necessary, from the case notes, or by letter follow up to the general practitioner. Expected outcomes for each of the 54 diagnoses were derived from both published reports where available and an expert panel of 18 consultant neurosurgeons. The cost of the neurosurgical service for 1983-4 was known from a separate study and the cost per patient was calculated using the length of stay. RESULTS--The cost of neurosurgery in 1983-4 was 1.8 million pounds. In all, 243 deaths or severe disabilities were estimated to have been averted at an average cost of 7325 pounds (range 5000 pounds to 70,000 pounds). The overall cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was 350 pounds (range 34 pounds to greater than 400,000 pounds). The cost of long term care for severely disabled survivors is at least 18-fold greater than the cost of neurosurgical intervention to avert such disability. CONCLUSIONS--In Britain neurosurgery is not expensive in comparison with the costs and benefits of other areas of medicine, and the cost per QALY is unexpectedly low except for severe diffuse head injury, malignant brain tumors, and cerebral metastases. The neurosurgical budget should be assessed in the context of managing a patient in hospital and subsequently in the community. \nDouble-blind placebo-controlled trial of buflomedil in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon: six-month follow-up. The efficacy of buflomedil in reducing the mean daily frequency and severity of winter ischemic attacks has been shown in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including 31 patients (16 in the buflomedil group, 15 in the placebo group) suffering from idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon and followed up for six months. The efficacy was confirmed by nail fold capillaroscopy, which showed a significant alleviation of hemodymanic disturbances and background pallor in comparison with the placebo. Results in terms of clinical and laboratory safety parameters assessed over a six-month period were satisfactory, thus demonstrating the possibility of a long-term treatment. \nReview article: migraine and pregnancy. A 27-year-old woman with no family or personal history of migraine presented with headache associated with unilateral paresthesias and blurred vision. This was her first, and so far only, attack of migraine with aura and led to the diagnosis of her pregnancy and to this review. Migraine can begin for the first time with pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. Cases of migraine with aura are the most commonly reported. Preexisting migraine usually improves with pregnancy, particularly if it was associated with menstrual migraine. Headache occurs frequently in the post-partum period, particularly in known migraineurs. Migraineurs have no increased risk of complications during pregnancy and their children have no increased incidence of birth defects. \nFoodborne outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7--North Dakota, 1990. In late July and early August 1990, an outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred among persons who had eaten a meal while attending an agricultural threshing show in North Dakota on July 28-29. At least 70 (3.5%) of the more than 2000 attendees were affected; of these, 16 persons were hospitalized, and two children, aged 2 and 8 years, were diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome. An epidemiologic investigation was conducted by the North Dakota State Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories. \nKaposi's sarcoma in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis possible responsibility of captopril in the development of lesions. Kaposi's sarcoma appeared 8 months after the start of captopril treatment in a 70-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis. A marked reduction of cutaneous and gastric lesions occurred when captopril was stopped. These findings are compared to immunosuppressive drug induced forms of Kaposi's sarcoma. \nNon-invasive assessment of perioperative myocardial cell damage by circulating cardiac troponin T. Troponin T is a unique cardiac antigen which is continuously released from infarcting myocardium. Its cardiospecificity as a marker protein might be particularly useful in assessing myocardial cell damage in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Therefore, circulating troponin T was measured in serial blood samples from 56 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and in two control groups--22 patients undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery and 12 patients undergoing lung surgery by median sternotomy. In both control groups no troponin T could be detected, whereas activities of creatine kinase were raised in all 12 lung surgery controls and activities of the MB isoenzyme were raised in five of the 12 patients in the lung surgery group and in four of the 22 patients in the orthopaedic surgery group, respectively. All the patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 47) and cardiac surgery for other reasons (n = 9) had detectable concentrations of troponin T. Five patients had perioperative myocardial infarction detected as new Q waves and R wave reductions. In these five patients troponin T release persisted and serum concentrations (5.5-23 micrograms/l) reached a peak on the fourth postoperative day. In the 51 patients without perioperative myocardial infarction serum concentrations and the release kinetics of troponin T depended on the duration of cardiac arrest. In patients in whom aortic cross clamping was short troponin T increased slightly on the first postoperative days; in patients with longer periods of aortic cross clamping troponin T concentrations were higher and remained so beyond the fifth postoperative day. \nHemodialysis grafts: color Doppler flow imaging correlated with digital subtraction angiography and functional status. Twenty-two patients with hemodialysis grafts were prospectively evaluated with color Doppler flow imaging and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Eighteen patients had normal functional parameters during hemodialysis, and four had increased venous pressure during hemodialysis. Color Doppler flow imaging allowed identification of nine macroaneurysms related to wall degeneration, two cases of spontaneous fistula formation between the graft and peripheral veins, and 20 stenoses. Use of color Doppler flow imaging led to overestimation of the degree of stenosis at the venous anastomosis when compared with use of angiography. Three cases of subclavian venous stenosis were identified only at angiography. Color Doppler flow imaging appears accurate in the detection of stenoses and seems sufficient for follow-up of normally functioning grafts. However, because of its low sensitivity for identification of proximal stenoses and the necessity of obtaining an angiogram to plan surgical or percutaneous correction, DSA remains the technique of choice. \nCoronary artery narrowing due to extrinsic compression by myocardial abscess. A case of aortic valve endocarditis complicated by perivalvular abscess extending into myocardium is presented. Echocardiography and aortography failed to detect the abscess, but coronary angiography revealed its presence by extrinsic compression of left anterior descending and diagonal arteries. Morphological features of this rare cause for coronary narrowing are described. \nLow angiotensinogen levels are related to the severity and liver dysfunction of congestive heart failure: implications for renin measurements. PURPOSE: To compare the determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) and the direct measurement of active renin by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) as methods of assessing the renin system in patients with congestive heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The status of the renin-angiotensin system in congestive heart failure was assessed by measuring the plasma renin substrate concentration, PRA, and plasma concentration of active renin in 37 patients with mild to severe congestive heart failure. Natremia and plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were determined as biologic indexes of the severity of heart failure, and concentrations of prealbumin and retinol-binding protein were used as indexes of liver dysfunction. RESULTS: The PRA and the concentrations of active renin and ANF were markedly higher in patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure than in patients with class II to III heart failure, while natremia and the concentrations of renin substrate, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein were markedly lower in the class IV patients than in the class II to III patients. Plasma renin substrate concentration was negatively correlated with active renin concentration (n = 37, r = -0.45, p = 0.005), and positively related to natremia (r = 0.56, p less than 0.0005), prealbumin (r = 0.54, p less than 0.001), and retinol-binding protein (r = 0.60, p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of plasma renin substrate can be considered as an indirect index of the severity of heart failure that reflects both the high level of circulating active renin and the decrease in hepatic protein output. In patients with class IV heart failure, low levels of renin substrate led to a marked underestimation of active renin concentration from measurements of PRA. In contrast, direct IRMA of active renin measures the true plasma active renin concentration, independent of plasma renin substrate, and closely reflects renin secretion. \nHuman astrocytes contain two distinct angiotensin receptor subtypes. The ability of angiotensin peptides to stimulate prostaglandin release and raise intracellular calcium levels by activating a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C was assessed in three human astrocytoma cell lines (CRTG3, STTG1, and WITG2). The addition of angiotensin II to CRTG3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent release of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin, the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and the mobilization of intracellular calcium. Angiotensin-(1-7), previously considered to be an inactive metabolite of angiotensin II, was as potent as angiotensin II for prostaglandin release but did not activate phospholipase C or mobilize intracellular calcium. In contrast, angiotensin-(2-8) caused only a slight increase in prostaglandin release, even though it was as effective as angiotensin II in augmenting inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and calcium mobilization. Moreover, neither the release of prostaglandins in response to angiotensin II or angiotensin-(1-7) nor the mobilization of intracellular calcium in response to angiotensin II required extracellular calcium. Angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) caused the release of prostaglandins from all three human astrocytoma cell lines, but changes in the level of intracellular calcium in response to angiotensin II only occurred in CRTG3 cells. Although previous studies have provided evidence for angiotensin receptor subtypes on the basis of selectivity of antagonists or signal transduction mechanisms, these data suggest that human astrocytes contain multiple angiotensin receptor subtypes on the basis of their response to different angiotensin heptapeptides--angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(2-8). \nSurgical and chemotherapeutic treatment of hepatic metastases from carcinoma of the breast. To date, no five year survival rates have been reported for patients with hepatic metastases (HM) from breast origin treated by chemotherapy or hormone therapy. This study was done to evaluate whether or not surgical excision of such metastatic disease associated with chemotherapy has any effect on such a poor prognosis. Between May 1985 and September 1988, 22 patients with a diagnosis of isolated (solitary or multiple) HM have been surgically treated. The therapeutic approach also included systemic preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. Laparotomy findings for those 22 patients are presented. There were benign hepatic lesions in four patients (four different histologic types) and hepatectomy was done in two patients. Diffuse metastatic disease contraindicated any attempt at hepatic resection in six patients. Hepatectomy was possible in 12 patients. There was no postoperative mortality and minimal morbidity. One-half of the patients with metastases had one or more positive lymph nodes at the hepatic pedicule. Median survival time for 12 patients treated by hepatectomy was 37 +/- 9 months after hepatectomy and 42 +/- 3 months after the discovery of HM. Eleven patients had other metastases after an average period of 11.8 months after hepatectomy, and the liver was the first site of recurrence in eight. One patient underwent a hepatectomy twice. Two patients were free of disease 29 to 46 months postoperatively in spite of poor prognostic features on the excised specimen. Although the median survival time was two times better than with usual treatment, we believe this procedure is of doubtful benefit. In this situation, hepatectomy acts as cytoreductive surgical treatment, with the main limiting factor being the relatively low effectiveness of chemotherapy. This type of therapy can be applied only to a restricted number of patients, and if we decide to proceed with this study, we will have to modify the protocol of chemotherapy radically. \nThe Health of the Public Program at the University of Washington: a new role for academic medical centers. The University of Washington Health of the Public Program has convened a consortium composed of the region's academic medical center, the two largest managed care plans in Washington, and representatives of the state's major private and public purchasers of health care. The consortium's purpose is to test the feasibility of collaboratively collecting cross-system data, assessing variations in practice, and implementing site-specific interventions to improve the management of common illnesses and encourage preventive care. Changes under way in the ambulatory training environment and in the undergraduate curriculum as a result of the consortium's initial efforts are described. In today's climate of cost consciousness and concerns about quality, academic medical centers can play an important role in helping to improve community-wide outcomes of care. \nNoninvasive detection of reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction based on plasma activity of creatine kinase MB subforms. Successful thrombolytic therapy is associated with an accelerated release of creatine kinase (CK) MB from necrotic myocardium. With use of a previously validated assay, the plasma kinetics of the myocardial subform (MB2) and the plasma-modified subform (MB1) were determined in blood samples obtained from 56 patients with acute Q wave myocardial infarction: 33 patients who received thrombolytic therapy (group A) and 23 patients managed conservatively (group B). Plasma MB2 activity increased more rapidly in the group A patients, but there was substantial overlap with group B. Plasma MB1 activity did not differ significantly between the two groups. The MB2/MB1 ratio was significantly higher in group A patients than in group B patients between 2 and 10 h after the onset of infarction. Among group A patients, the ratio increased from 2.4 +/- 1.6 to 4.6 +/- 2.0 in the 1st h after therapy (p less than 0.001). The peak ratio was 6.3 +/- 2.5 in group A patients and 3.1 +/- 1.2 in group B patients. Twenty-seven of the 33 group A patients had a peak ratio greater than 3.8 versus 5 of the 23 group B patients (p less than 0.001). In seven group A patients, the ratio was greater than 3.8 before plasma CK MB activity was out of the normal range. Angiography was performed at 5.0 +/- 3.5 days in 39 patients. Eighteen (90%) of 20 patients with a patent infarct-related artery had a peak ratio greater than 3.8; 17 (89.5%) of 19 patients with an occluded infarct-related artery had a ratio less than 3.8 (p less than 0.001). \nEstimate of breast cancer risk reduction with weight loss. Upper body fat localization has been associated with an increased risk of cancer. This study demonstrated that 64.2% of 124 women with at least a 4.5-kg weight loss decreased their upper body fat localization, as measured by a reduction in their suprailiac-thigh skin fold ratio and other skin fold thicknesses associated with upper body fat localization. Based on a risk model previously developed for breast cancer and upper body fat localization, a reduction in estimated breast cancer relative risk of 45% was calculated for the entire group of women who lost 4.5 kg or more in weight. Greater weight loss further reduced upper body fat localization and estimated breast cancer risk based on this model. \nSeverity of childhood bacterial meningitis and duration of illness before diagnosis. Rapid diagnosis of childhood bacterial meningitis (BM) is generally believed to be essential to avoid poor outcome. To see whether duration of illness before admission to hospital was related to the severity of illness, data from children with BM diagnosed in 18 paediatric hospitals in Finland from 1984 to 1989 were collected prospectively. We divided 286 cases with culture-positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into three groups: BM with a history of up to 24 h (short-history group, n = 141), of more than 24 h and up to 48 h (intermediate-history group, n = 75), and of more than 48 h (long-history group, n = 70). The longer the history, the better the clinical condition of the child. If symptoms or signs of BM lasted 48 h or less, the child did significantly worse, as judged by seven variables, than if the history was longer than 48 h (level of consciousness, p less than 0.001; seizures, p less than 0.01; CSF protein concentration, p less than 0.001; positive CSF gram-stain, p less than 0.01; positive blood culture, p less than 0.05 in Haemophilus influenzae meningitis; serum C-reactive protein, p less than 0.01 between intermediate-history and long-history groups; and urine sodium concentration, p less than 0.001). The differences were not affected by causative organism, sex, age, or preadmission oral antimicrobial agents. The findings show that if BM follows an insidious pattern of disease, diagnostic delay may be unavoidable, which may have medicolegal implications. \nSuccessful treatment of a persistent cyst, developing after ovarian transposition, with leuprolide acetate. Persistent ovarian cysts are considered to be the most troublesome complication of ovarian transposition. Transabdominal drainage or surgical removal is often required. This paper reports the successful use of leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, in the treatment of a symptomatic and persistent ovarian cyst which developed after ovarian transposition. The benefits of this therapy over others are discussed. \nHereditary ataxias and paraplegias in Cantabria, Spain. An epidemiological and clinical study. A clinical, genetic and epidemiological study of hereditary ataxias and paraplegias was conducted within a defined area (Cantabria) in Northern Spain from 1974 to 1986. The series comprised 48 index cases and 65 affected relatives. On prevalence day, 103 patients were alive, giving a prevalence of 20.2 cases per 100,000. There were 24 patients (18 families) with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), 12 (6 families) with early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA) differing from FA, 6 (3 families) with dominantly transmitted late onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA), 11 with 'idiopathic' LOCA, 49 (9 families) with 'pure' hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), and 1 patient with congenital cerebellar ataxia. The prevalence found here is comparable with the highest figures described in previous surveys. This may in part be due to the great number of secondary cases in our series. A high frequency of parental consanguinity occurred in FA patients, 'pseudodominant' inheritance being observed in 1 family. The clinical features were those of classical FA except for later onset and slower course in 1 family, and retained tendon reflexes in the lower limbs in 2 cases. Such data indicate the need for modification of the essential criteria for the disease. EOCA included 4 patients with normoreflexic ataxia and 1 patient with ataxia and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone deficiency. In addition, there were 7 patients from 2 unrelated families with a homogeneous syndrome characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and sensory neuropathy. This syndrome is therefore a well defined nosological entity to be added to the list of autosomal recessive mendelian phenotypes. The clinical picture of patients with LOCA was either a 'pure' cerebellar or a 'cerebellar-plus' syndrome. Genetic subgroups of 'pure' HSP were autosomal dominant type I in 5 families and type II in 2, and autosomal recessive in 2 families. \nC-reactive protein as an index of disease activity. Comparison of tenidap, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in rat adjuvant arthritis. C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations are a useful plasma protein measure that correlate with disease severity and radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We compared 3 drugs with different mechanisms, i.e., tenidap, dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, on both CRP levels and soft tissue swelling in the rat adjuvant arthritis model. CRP rose from a normal concentration of approximately 400 micrograms/ml during the first phase of adjuvant arthritis to approximately 1200 micrograms/ml (primary response), then fell to approximately 900 micrograms/ml and rose again as the disease became systemic during the secondary response to approximately 1400 micrograms/ml. When treatment was administered prophylactically, tenidap and dexamethasone suppressed both the primary and secondary CRP and swelling responses. Cyclophosphamide was without effect in the primary response, but inhibited both swelling and CRP in the secondary response. When therapeutic treatment was begun after secondary disease was established, only tenidap and dexamethasone inhibited CRP and swelling. Both dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide decreased lymphocyte numbers during treatment whereas lymphocyte numbers were elevated during tenidap treatment, suggesting a different mechanism of action for tenidap. CRP levels were more closely linked to the rate of change of paw swelling (disease progression) than to paw volume. \nTreatment of ulcerated hemangiomas with the pulsed tunable dye laser. Hemangiomas are the most common tumor of infancy and are characterized by rapid growth during the first 6 months of life. During the rapid growth phase, approximately 5% to 10% of the hemangiomas ulcerate. Ulcerated lesions are painful, may bleed, and are at risk for bacterial infection. Previous therapy has included daily local wound care, topical antibiotics, and local and systemic steroids. We treated nine infants (eight female and one male) with ulcerated hemangiomas by means of a vascular-specific (585-nm) pulsed (450-microsecond) tunable dye laser. Eight of the nine patients had a single ulceration, whereas one patient had two ulcerations within a large hemangioma. Six of the ulcerations healed with a single laser treatment. One ulceration required two treatments to heal, and the remaining two required three treatments. Pain was subjectively decreased within 2 to 3 days in all patients after a single treatment. The pulsed tunable dye laser should be considered in the treatment of all ulcerated hemangiomas. \nRandomised trial of laxatives in treatment of childhood encopresis. Primary faecal incontinence (encopresis) in children is usually treated with laxative medication and a behaviour modification programme aimed at promoting regular toileting, but the effectiveness of laxatives has never been adequately investigated. 169 children with encopresis and evidence of stool on plain abdominal radiograph were randomly allocated to receive multimodal (MM) therapy (laxatives plus behaviour modification; n = 83) or behaviour modification alone (BM; n = 86). Mean (SD) follow-up was 55.1 (27.0) weeks and 56.7 (32.0) weeks, respectively. By 12 months' follow-up 42 (51%) of the MM group and 31 (36%) of the BM group (p = 0.079) had achieved remission (at least one 4 week period with no soiling episodes) and 52 (63%) vs 37 (43%) (p = 0.016) had achieved at least partial remission (soiling no more than once a week). MM subjects achieved remission significantly sooner than BM subjects, and the difference in the Kaplan-Meier remission curves was most striking in the first 30 weeks of follow-up (p = 0.012). The patterns of compliance with toileting in the treatment groups were almost identical, although about 1 in 8 children overall did not comply with the sitting programme. After exclusion of the 24 poor compliers, there was no significant difference between BM and MM groups. This study shows a clear advantage overall for the use of laxative medication, although the benefit may not be as great for children who are able to maintain regular toileting. \nBenign pleural effusions in long-standing diabetes mellitus. We studied intractable pleural effusions in five patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus and an additional 40 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction to determine whether the frequency of pleural effusions is increased in diabetic patients and, if so, the relation of pleural effusions to left ventricular dysfunction. In our initial observations, effusions were benign, were not always associated with congestive heart failure (CHF), and reaccumulated following thoracentesis. Effusions associated with CHF persisted despite medical treatment and improvement of CHF. In our study of 40 patients with similar degrees of left ventricular dysfunction, the incidence of pleural effusions in diabetic patients was 83 percent and in our nondiabetic patients was 14 percent (p less than 0.001). We conclude that pleural effusions occur more commonly in diabetic than nondiabetic patients and may be related to left ventricular dysfunction and possibly other factors leading to increased effusion. \nAdjuvant chemotherapy of high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity. Updated results of the Multi-Institutional Osteosarcoma Study. The Multi-Institutional Osteosarcoma Study (MIOS) was designed to determine whether intensive multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy improves the outcome of patients with nonmetastatic high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity as compared with concurrent controls. After definitive surgery of the primary tumor, patients were randomly assigned to immediate adjuvant chemotherapy or to observation without adjuvant treatment. Updated results of this trial indicate that the projected six-year event-free survival for the control group is 11% compared to 61% for the chemotherapy group (p less than 0.001). Similar results were observed in patients who declined randomization but who were followed according to the treatment arms of the protocol. When randomized and nonrandomized patients are pooled according to assigned treatment, a survival advantage favoring those patients treated with immediate adjuvant chemotherapy is apparent. An analysis of prognostic factors among patients receiving immediate adjuvant chemotherapy reveals that elevation of the serum lactic dehydrogenase at diagnosis is the factor most predictive of adverse outcome. Location of the primary site in the tibia confers a favorable prognosis. The authors conclude that the natural history of high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity has not changed over the past two decades. The administration of immediate adjuvant chemotherapy has a significant favorable impact on event-free survival and should be recommended for all such patients. \nThe transmandibular implant: a 13-year survey of its use. During the period from August 1976 until July 1989 the transmandibular implant was introduced in a total of 31 oral and maxillofacial surgery departments in the Netherlands and 1,466 patients were treated. This study includes 1,356 treated patients from 28 departments. The treatment course of 1,201 patients (89.6%) was uneventful. Of the 157 complications, 58 related to the anatomic contour of the mandible, 49 to the surgery, 25 to the prosthetic reconstruction, 8 to the psychosocial attitude of the patient, 8 to the use of medication, 5 to trauma, and 4 to the presence of a skin graft. Treatment of the complications included removal of the implant in 44 patients; in 106 patients the complication was treated satisfactorily. In the remaining 7 patients, hypesthesia was present. The reasons for the removal of the 44 implants were infection (11), operative error (5), premature loading of the implant (3), insufficient width of the mandible after a visor osteotomy (1), loss of osseointegration caused by the prosthesis (14), psychological problems (4), trauma (3), drug-related gingival hyperplasia (2), and inexplicable pain (1). The present survey shows a consistent success rate of 96.8%. \nConservative management of intraductal carcinoma (DCIS) of the breast. Collaborating NSABP investigators. Seventy-six patients with intraductal carcinoma (DCIS) of the breast have been observed for 83 months (range 50-141) following treatment by lumpectomy (L) only (21), L and breast irradiation (XRT) (27), or mastectomy (28). All represented examples of DCIS retrieved after pathologic examination of a much larger cohort of patients with stage I and II invasive breast cancer enrolled in NSABP protocol 6. Local breast recurrences were similar for women with DCIS and those from this cohort at a similar period of follow-up with invasive cancer treated by L only (43% vs. 39%) and L + XRT (7% vs. 10%). The presence of moderate/marked comedonecrosis was suggestively related to local breast recurrence (P = .07). This latter was significantly reduced for patients receiving post L XRT (P = .01). All local breast recurrences in this study and 29 of 31 recorded by others occurred at or close to the site of extirpation of the index cancer minimizing multicentricity as a contraindication for the conservative surgical treatment of DCIS. Survival rates which were similar for patients with DCIS regardless of form of local treatment were better than that observed for negative node patients with invasive cancer enrolled in protocol 6. Thus, DCIS is a less, not more, ominous disease than invasive cancer. This and other features of its natural history indicate that it would be a contradiction to treat invasive cancer but not DCIS conservatively. \nMaple syrup urine disease. Complete defect of the E1 beta subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex due to a deletion of an 11-bp repeat sequence which encodes a mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in a family with the disease. Branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) deficiency results in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). We examined the molecular basis of familial cases of MSUD by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA sequence, and genome structure of the affected enzyme. The BCKDH activity in the proband with MSUD was approximately 6% of the normal control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH was absent and that the E1 alpha subunit of BCKDH was markedly reduced. We amplified the cDNAs of the E1 alpha subunit and the E1 beta subunit of the BCKDH complex obtained from cells of the patient, using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNAs. The deduced amino acid sequence for the E1 alpha subunit of the patient's cell was normal. An 11-bp deletion was identified in the region that encoded the mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in the E1 beta cDNA. This 11-bp sequence is found in the first exon of the BCKDH-E1 beta gene, as a direct tandem repeat. Amplification of genomic DNA revealed that the consanguineous parents were heterozygous for this mutant allele, and sister and brother of the patient with the disease were homozygous for this mutant allele. This 11-bp deletion mutation caused a change in the reading frame and the mature E1 beta protein was defective. These observations show the biological importance of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the enzyme activity. The absence of the E1 beta subunit results in instability of the E1 alpha subunit. \nEosinophilia myalgia syndrome: I. Immunocytochemical evidence for a T-cell-mediated immune effector response. Specimens of muscle and fascia from 13 patients fulfilling the Centers for Disease Control criteria for the eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS) were studied by quantitative immunocytochemical analysis. The immunolocalization of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD22, and CD56 markers, the gamma delta T-cell receptor, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I complex and class II antigens, and complement membrane attack complex (MAC) were examined. The distribution and relative proportions of T cells and T-cell subsets, B cells, macrophages, and eosinophils were determined at perivascular, perimysial, endomysial, and fascial sites of accumulation. At all sites, T cells were predominant, CD8+ cells outnumbered CD4+ cells 6- to 20-fold, and between 60 and 80% of T cells were activated. B cells and eosinophils each accounted for less than 3% of inflammatory cells. Very few cells expressed either the gamma delta T-cell receptor or natural killer cell markers. As in dermatomyositis (DM), MHC class I antigen complex expression was increased on many structurally normal muscle fibers, but in contrast to DM, microvascular MAC deposits were not a feature of EMS. The findings implicate a cellular immune response directed against a connective tissue component in EMS. \nThe expression of epidermal growth factor receptor on human bladder cancer: potential use in radioimmunoscintigraphy. Monoclonal antibody 425, which binds to an extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor, was used to evaluate the expression of this antigen on bladder cancer cells. Epidermal growth factor receptor was found on all bladder cancer cell lines tested. Immunoperoxidase staining of fourteen invasive human bladder cancers with monoclonal antibody 425 demonstrated that ten showed strong staining, one showed weak staining and three were negative. Five noninvasive tumors were similarly examined. Four of these were negative and one showed weak staining. Biodistribution experiments with human bladder tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice using radiolabeled monoclonal antibody 425 and an isotype matched control antibody demonstrated specific tumor localization at five and seven days following antibody injection. Successful imaging of a human bladder tumor xenograft was achieved five days post antibody injection. These data confirm that epidermal growth factor receptor expression correlates with bladder cancer stage and suggests that epidermal growth factor receptor may serve as a target antigen for radioimmunoscintigraphy. \nA quantitative histopathological study of right bundle branch block complicating acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether necrosis of the right bundle branch is responsible for development of right bundle branch block in acute myocardial infarction. Twenty patients with acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction were studied--10 with right bundle branch block (group A) and 10 without (group B)--to evaluate by serial sectioning the pathological extent of myocardial infarction surrounding the right bundle branch and also that of right bundle branch necrosis. Myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch more than 8 mm above the moderator band in all of group A, whereas myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch less than 3 mm above the moderator band in only three patients in group B. Nine hearts in group A showed significant necrosis of the right bundle branch. In group B and in one case with transient right bundle branch block no necrosis was found. The occurrence of right bundle branch block was almost entirely explained by necrosis of the right bundle branch, but transient right bundle branch block did develop without necrosis of the right bundle branch. \nThe role of hospital delivery systems in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction: rural hospital setting. Discussions on the use of thrombolytic therapy include when is the best time for administration, where is the best place for administration, and who is the most appropriate to begin the administration. Rapid triage and intervention for patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction are special challenges in rural communities. To evaluate the possibility of instituting rapid, \"golden hour\" treatment for the patient with acute myocardial infarction, rural health care resources must be reviewed. Changes in the health care environment and access to emergent care for the patient with acute myocardial infarction directly affect any treatment. Timely interventions depend on available personnel, appropriate clinical protocols, and regional network systems. \nAntibodies against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes: presence in alcoholic, non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects. Several studies have recently shown the presence of antibodies against acetaldehyde-modifications in the sera of alcoholic patients. To assess the specificity of this immune response, plasma immunoreactivity with proteins modified in vitro by acetaldehyde was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 97 alcoholic patients with varying degrees of alcoholic liver disease, in 35 patients with non-alcoholic liver diseases and in 33 control subjects who were social drinkers. All three groups showed some response against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes. The highest plasma reactivities were found in alcoholics, especially those with steatosis and alcoholic hepatitis. Plasma from patients with non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects also reacted with the acetaldehyde conjugates, but to a lesser extent than plasma from alcoholics. The reliability of these antibodies as markers of either alcohol abuse or alcoholic liver disease therefore appears to be low. However, further studies using more precisely modified proteins or elucidation of the classes of immunoglobulin involved in the immune response against the modified proteins may give clearer differences between the three groups. \nEndoscopic laser therapy for obstructing tracheobronchial lesions. The Lahey Clinic experience using laser bronchoscopy for relief of obstructive tracheobronchial lesions during a 7-year period from 1982 to 1989 involves 269 patients treated with 400 procedures. The carbon dioxide (CO2) laser was used for tracheal stenosis and granulation tissue. The neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used for all obstructing endobronchial neoplasms. Indications for therapy included severe dyspnea, hemoptysis, and postobstructive pneumonitis. All patients had relatively central lesions. A rigid bronchoscope was used to treat 88% of patients, and 12% of patients were treated with a flexible bronchoscope. One death occurred during the intraoperative period. Eleven deaths occurred within 1 week of therapy and were related to the presence of extensive malignant lesions or to coronary artery disease. Our experience indicates that bronchoscopic application of the CO2 or Nd:YAG laser affords effective palliation for patients with obstructive tracheobronchial lesions. The Nd:YAG laser is recommended for patients with bulky vascular endobronchial neoplasms, and the CO2 laser is best reserved for patients with benign tracheal stenosis and granulation tissue. \nCause of death in unsuccessful prehospital resuscitation. During 1987-1988, prehospital resuscitation was unsuccessful in 204 of 381 patients who suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest due to presumed coronary heart disease in Helsinki. The cause of death was verified by autopsy in 80 (39%) of the 204 patients. Their cause of death could not be estimated on the basis of previous patient history, and their autopsy diagnoses were then related to the initial cardiac rhythm recorded at the scene. At autopsy, coronary heart disease was considered to have been the cause of death in 78% of the patients with ventricular fibrillation, in 43% of the patients with electromechanical dissociation (EMD), and in 60% of the patients in asystole. Cardiac tamponade or massive pulmonary embolism was the cause of death in 15 of the 28 patients with EMD who underwent autopsy. These findings support previously noted relationships between some causes of cardiac arrest and the initial cardiac rhythm, and also in prehospital cardiac arrest patients with unsuccessful resuscitation. \nEvidence from cadavers suggestive of entrapment of fifth lumbar spinal nerves by lumbosacral ligaments. Lumbosacral spines from 51 geriatric-age cadavers (25 men and 26 women) were examined both grossly and under the dissecting microscope for evidence of compression of fifth lumbar spinal nerves by their respective lumbosacral ligaments. These ligaments were found to extend from the transverse process and body of L5 to the ala of the sacrum in 97% of the specimens, and from the transverse process and body of L5 to the promontory of the sacrum in 3% of the specimens. Anterior primary rami of the fifth lumbar spinal nerve were observed to be compressed in 11% (11 of 102) of the specimens examined grossly and under the dissecting microscope. Histologic evidence of chronic compression, as suggested by perineurial and endoneurial fibrosis, peripheral thinning of myelin sheaths, or subjective evidence of a shift in fiber diameter to a population of smaller size fibers was found, deep to the lumbosacral ligament, in three of the 11 nerves judged to be compressed. The information derived is of interest to the clinician whose patient presents with L5 root signs and a myelogram, discogram, and computed tomographic scan which do not show any abnormality. The possibility of extraforaminal compression must be considered as a possible source of the clinical signs. \nMR evaluation of CNS tumors: dose comparison study with gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoteridol. In phase II and III trials of gadoteridol (Gd-HP-D03A), a new nonionic, low-osmolar contrast agent, 40 patients with intracranial neoplasms underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with experimental doses of 0.05-0.3 mmol/kg. Fifteen patients also underwent contrast studies with the standard dose (0.1 mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Both gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoteridol appear to have a similar effect when given in equal doses (0.1 mmol/kg, n = 5). Lesion enhancement and delineation were better at higher experimental doses (0.2 or 0.3 mmol/kg, n = 7) and worse at a lower experimental dose (0.05 mmol/kg, n = 3). Quantitative analysis of 10 lesions examined with identical imaging protocols revealed a directly proportional relationship (r = .975) between lesion contrast ratio and dose over a range of 0.05-0.3 mmol/kg. Phantom experiments support the clinical results. Improved enhancement, detection, and delineation of central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms resulting from increased injected doses of gadoteridol have the potential to be clinically significant and may justify the possibly higher cost of increased contrast material dosage. Lower doses may not be adequate for the evaluation of most CNS tumors. \nImportance of the renin-angiotensin system in sodium regulation in essential hypertension. To elucidate the effect of natriuretic and antinatriuretic factors on the excretion of an intravenous sodium load, we observed the natriuretic responses of 12 patients with essential hypertension (EHT) and 7 age- and sex-matched normotensive (NT) subjects following the intravenous administration of 1500 mL of normal saline over a 3 h period. After saline infusion, both groups showed increases in urinary sodium excretion (UNaV). The increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and urinary dopamine excretion (UDAV) and the suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) were similar in both groups. However, no significant change in blood pressure (BP) was seen in either group. Since significant negative linear correlations between the basal level of PRA and percent change in UNaV or GFR were seen only in EHT, we observed the influence of suppressing the renin-angiotensin system with a converting enzyme inhibitor. After a 7 day treatment with enalapril, GFR and UNaV in EHT after saline infusion were comparable to data obtained in the absence of enalapril, despite a reduction in preexpansion BP. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between the basal BP and the percent increase in UNaV was seen among EHT after enalapril treatment. These results suggest that the state of the renin-angiotensin system is important in renal sodium excretion in EHT. \nMechanisms of otitis media development. Involvement of neurogenic inflammation. The mucosal lining of the middle ear cavity, in particular that of the tympanic membrane and its pars flaccida, exhibits a number of sensory nerves containing the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The mucosa is not only rich in nerves and blood vessels but also contains numerous mast cells. It is possible that interactions between histamine-containing mast cells and SP-containing and CGRP-containing nerves--neurogenic inflammation--is one of the mechanisms involved in vessel permeability changes in otitis media with effusion. \nTelangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma of the extremities. Results in 17 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seventeen patients with telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma (TOS) of the extremities were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, according to two different protocols. Preoperatively, the patients received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cisplatinum (CPD) (HD-MTX/CPD) and doxorubicin. CPD was delivered intraarterially, the other drugs intravenously. Limb-salvage surgery was performed in 12 instances, and five patients were treated with amputation. Postoperative chemotherapy was tailored according to the grade of chemotherapy-induced necrosis. In 13 cases (86%), the resultant grade of necrosis was greater than 90% (good responders). The mean follow-up interval was 3.5 years with a range of 18 to 78 months. Fourteen patients (82%) remained continuously disease-free, while three patients developed lung metastases. Two of these died because of uncontrolled disease, whereas the third patient is alive and disease-free after metastasectomy. No local recurrences were observed. These results are better than those observed in 215 contemporary cases of conventional osteosarcoma treated with the same protocols. This study confirms that TOS is not a uniformly lethal tumor as suggested by prior reports. By employing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a high percentage of patients with TOS can be cured, and in most of them, a limb-sparing surgery is possible and safe. \nClinical features of 31 patients with Ki-1 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma Thirty-one patients were diagnosed by morphologic and immunophenotypic features as having primary Ki-1 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (Ki-1 ALCL). the median age was 35 years (range, 4 months to 78 years); the male:female ratio was 18:13. B symptoms were observed in 13 patients. Peripheral adenopathy was present in 26 patients, while mediastinal adenopathy occurred in five. There was extranodal disease in 13 patients; the most common extranodal site was skin with seven affected. Seventeen patients had stage III/IV disease. Immunophenotypes were T cell in 24 patients and B cell in four patients; immunophenotype could not be determined in three patients. Cytogenetic abnormalities in chromosomes 2, 5, and 7 were detected in three patients. Although therapy was heterogeneous, the actuarial 2-year survival was 73%. Two-year disease-free survival was 39% for all patients; for stages I and II, it was 62% compared with 20% for stages III and IV (P = .001). Complete remission (CR) occurred in 21 of 23 patients receiving combination chemotherapy; however, nine relapses, including six of seven stage IV patients, occurred within 21 months of diagnosis. Preliminary observations suggest that Ki-1 ALCL may have a quiescent phase in the rare patient with only localized skin disease. However, the disease generally behaves as an intermediate- to high-grade lymphoma, and patients with Ki-1 ALCL should receive curative-intent combination chemotherapy. \nRenal vascular response to sodium loading in sons of hypertensive parents. Studies of normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents offer the potential to identify inherited abnormalities that contribute to essential hypertension. We compared renal and systemic hemodynamic responses to saline infusion between normotensive sons of two hypertensive parents (SOHT) and sons of two normotensive parents (SONT) selected from the general population of Rochester, Minn. Hemodynamic measurements were performed after a week of low sodium intake (10 meq/day) and were repeated after a week of high sodium intake (200 meq/day). Despite being in the normotensive range, blood pressures in SOHT were higher than those in SONT during low sodium (124 +/- 3/85 +/- 3 versus 118 +/- 2/71 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and high sodium (122 +/- 3/80 +/- 3 versus 112 +/- 2/70 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) conditions. Higher pressures in SOHT were associated with elevated systemic and renal vascular resistance. After a high sodium diet, renal vascular resistance in SOHT rose further during acute saline infusion, whereas systemic vascular resistance did not change. After a low sodium diet, this renal vasoconstrictor response to saline infusion in SOHT was not present, and renal vascular resistance fell to levels not different from SONT. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide did not differ between SONT and SOHT. Circulating levels of norepinephrine were higher in SOHT. These data demonstrate a renal vasoconstrictor response to saline infusion in normotensive SOHT, which depends on prior sodium intake. This alteration in renal hemodynamics may represent an inherited abnormality related to the development of hypertension. \nSolitary polyclonal autonomous thyroid nodule: a rare cause of childhood hyperthyroidism. Solitary autonomous thyroid tumors are an unusual cause of hyperthyroidism, particularly in childhood. We describe the youngest individual so far reported with this condition, a 22 month child with a large hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule who became overtly hyperthyroid after iodinated contrast administration. The histology of the nodule was compatible with follicular cell hyperplasia. These tumors are often called toxic adenomas, although there is no solid evidence that they are true neoplasms. We examined the clonal composition of the child's thyroid tumor by X-chromosome inactivation analysis, taking advantage of a polymorphism in the X-chromosome gene phosphoglycerate kinase. The tumor consisted of an even mixture of cells containing activated paternal and maternal PGK alleles, indicating that the tumor was polyclonal. Furthermore, the nodule had no structural rearrangements or activating point mutations of ras oncogenes, which are found in up to 50% of solitary monoclonal follicular adenomas. Solitary hot nodules may at least in some cases be secondary to hyperplasia, and not to clonal expansion of an abnormal, mutated cell. This may also explain the relatively low frequency of malignant transformation observed in hyperfunctioning thyroid tumors. \nTemperature and total white blood cell count as indicators of bacteremia. This study was designed to quantify more precisely the accuracy of magnitude of rectal temperature and total white blood cell (WBC) count as indicators of bacteremia in children with an obvious focal bacterial infection. A total of 955 children, aged 3 to 36 months, who had rectal temperature greater than or equal to 39.0 degrees C and were seeking care at either of two urban pediatric emergency departments had blood drawn for culture; 885 had blood drawn for WBC count. Twenty-seven had bacteremia. Various combinations of temperature and WBC count were selected to construct receiver-operating-characteristic curves by plotting sensitivity vs false-positive rate (1 - specificity). The receiver-operating-characteristic curve of WBC count provided significantly better diagnostic information than the curve for temperature increments above 39.0 degrees C. Each increment of 0.5 degrees C led to large decrements in sensitivity and false-positive rates. At a WBC count cutoff of 10,000/mm3, the sensitivity was 92% while the false-positive rate was 57%. Using this cutoff point, the clinician could have avoided performing 368 of 955 blood cultures and missed only 2 of 26 children with bacteremia. Receiver-operating-characteristic curves combining WBC count and temperature increments above 39.0 degrees C provided no better diagnostic information than that of WBC count at a temperature cutoff of 39.0 degrees C. It is concluded that increments in temperature above 39.0 degrees C provided additional diagnostic specificity for bacteremia only at the expense of unacceptable decreases in sensitivity. Total WBC count provided better information. A WBC count cutoff of 10,000/mm3 increased specificity with minimal decrease in sensitivity. \nPulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Fatal progression of pulmonary hypertension despite steroid-induced remission of interstitial pneumonitis. This report describes a 28-yr-old patient with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). She presented with pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia, and interstitial pneumonitis. We report the discordance between the response of her hypoxemia and interstitial pneumonitis, which resolved with corticosteroid therapy, and her progressive pulmonary hypertension, which caused fatal right heart failure. This report emphasizes that the radiographic interstitial shadowing of PVOD may be caused by either (1) an inflammatory interstitial pneumonitis (which may be responsive to anti-inflammatory therapy) or (2) interstitial pulmonary edema, or both. \nLow-dose isradipine once daily effectively controls 24-h blood pressure in essential hypertension. In one study of 10 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, equivalent total daily doses (13 +/- 2 mg) of isradipine given twice daily and a modified-release formulation of isradipine (isradipine MR) given once daily were found to control adequately 24 h ambulatory blood pressure compared with placebo (P less than .001 for each v placebo). In another study of 22 patients with essential hypertension, 5 and 10 mg isradipine MR once daily has been shown to reduce the average 24 h blood pressure by 11 +/- 1/6 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than .001) and 13 +/- 2/9 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than .001), respectively, compared with placebo. There was no loss of efficacy with isradipine MR during the 24 h observation period with either dose. In conclusion, low-dose isradipine MR once daily is an effective first-line treatment in essential hypertension. \nPediatric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed 42 times in 38 patients aged 14 months to 20 yr at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from 1982 to 1990. The adult side-viewing duodenoscope, Olympus JF1T, was used for all procedures. Intravenous sedation was used in 68% of the patients, whereas general anesthesia was employed in the remainder. Visualization of the appropriate ductal system was accomplished in 35 patients (92%). No therapeutic maneuvers were performed at endoscopy. Eleven of the 22 patients with ductal abnormalities underwent surgical treatment, based on the ERCP findings. The only complication encountered was mild pancreatitis in three patients (8%), all with a history of pancreatitis. We conclude that ERCP is a safe, useful procedure in the evaluation of children with pancreaticobiliary disorders, and in the identification of surgically correctable lesions in 29% of those patients. \nVenous emboli occurring caesarean section: the effect of patient position. The effect of position, horizontal versus 5 degrees reverse Trendelenburg's, on the incidence of venous emboli during Caesarean section was evaluated in 207 patients. Venous emboli were diagnosed using precordial ultrasonic Doppler monitoring. In the horizontal position, 44% (60 of 134) parturients had venous emboli compared with 1% (1 of 73) parturients in the 5 degrees reverse Trendelenburg's position (P less than 0.0001). Epidural anaesthesia was performed in 171 patients, and 36 patients had general anaesthesia. In the epidural group, pulse oximetric haemoglobin oxygen desaturation and complaints of chest pain and/or dyspnoea were associated with the venous emboli. Venous emboli, probably air, occur frequently during Caesarean section with the patient in the horizontal position. This occurrence was minimized by placing the patient in the 5 degrees reverse Trendelenburg's position. \nRecognizing early Parkinson's disease. Differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should cover not only the classic disorder described by James Parkinson in 1817 (paralysis agitans) but also numerous other idiopathic and secondary disorders that have varying degrees of parkinsonian features. Because treatment options can vary greatly among mimicking disorders and differ from those effective for Parkinson's disease, a prompt, accurate diagnosis is essential. Physicians can distinguish between these often-overlapping disorders by differentiating primary from secondary parkinsonism and by classifying primary syndromes into disorders with prominent tremor and those without. \nSpontaneous haematomyelia: a necropsy study. Spontaneous haematomyelia (intramedullary spinal haematoma), is an uncommon event. Predisposing conditions have been reported including syringomyelia, pregnancy and delivery, angioma, spinal artery aneurysm, and haemophilia, but only rarely has a pathological evaluation been performed. Two such cases studied at necropsy are reported. In one case, the haematoma was restricted to the cervical spinal cord, while in the second case it extended from the medulla into the lowest thoracic cord segments. In both cases the haematomyelia was fatal. In the first case the clinical course was subacute, but in the other the course was more acute. Careful neuropathological examination showed no apparent cause for the haemorrhages. \nAn in vivo model of experimental arterial stenosis, intimal damage, and periodic thrombosis. Coronary artery bypass grafts, angioplasty, and thrombolysis are beneficial procedures for patients with coronary artery disease. However, these procedures can fail by mechanisms related to interactions between platelets and the damaged arterial wall. An experimental model for studying some of the mechanisms of platelet interaction with endothelial- and medial-damaged stenosed arteries is described. Dogs or pigs are anesthetized, and the chest opened. The heart is exposed, the circumflex or left anterior descending coronary artery is dissected out, and an EMF or Doppler flow probe is placed on it. Distal to the flow probe, the artery is clamped with a vascular clamp to produce endothelial and/or medial injury. Then, an encircling plastic cylinder is placed around the outside of the injured artery, producing a \"critical stenosis.\" Acute platelet thrombus formation begins to occur in the stenosed lumen, gradually increasing the amount of stenosis. This causes the coronary flow to decline and reach zero flow when the artery is completely occluded. Then, the thrombus is embolized into the distal circulation, and flow is restored to normal levels. This occurs repeatedly causing cyclic flow reductions (CFRs). These CFRs can be made larger and to occur more frequently by increasing in vivo platelet activity, by raising the plasma catecholamine levels, or by increasing the collagen exposed in the stenosed lumen by increased medial damage. If an effective dose of an antiplatelet agent is given, the CFRs will be decreased in size and frequency or abolished entirely. Aspirin and other agents abolish the CFRs in this model; however, CFRs can be renewed by infusions of catecholamines or platelet activating factor. Thus, the model may be useful for studying mechanisms that enhance or inhibit arterial thrombosis in stenosed arteries with endothelial and medial injury. \nCharacterization of recombinant factor VIII and a recombinant factor VIII deletion mutant using a rabbit immunogenicity model system. The use of factor VIII prepared genetically engineered cell lines (rFVIII) may avoid some of the problems inherently associated with administering plasma-derived factor VIII (pdFVIII) concentrates to hemophilia A patients. Although rFVIII may represent an improvement over traditional therapeutics, the chance exists that protein production in cell culture may result in the presence of novel epitopes that may enhance the formation of inhibitor antibodies capable of neutralizing either rFVIII or pdFVIII. To assess the differences between rFVIII and its plasma-derived homologue, a rabbit immunogenicity model system was developed. Antibodies raised to rFVIII in rabbits were tested for the presence of antibodies capable of binding rFVIII but not pdFVIII, the presence of which would suggest that novel epitope(s) were present. This analysis was performed using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as well as immunoadsorption. For either technique, rFVIII-specific antibodies were not detected, indicating that differences between rFVIII and pdFVIII were not found. When a rFVIII B-region deletion mutant was similarly tested, antibodies specific for this protein were found. These specific antibodies appeared to bind in the vicinity of the deletion site and their binding was not affected by carbohydrate removal. These results indicate that the rabbit immunogenicity model system is sensitive to alterations in the factor VIII molecule and suggest that full-length rFVIII will not be any more immunogenic in human patients than pdFVIII. \nThrombin and parathyroid hormone mobilize intracellular calcium in rat osteosarcoma cells by distinct pathways. The mechanisms by which PTH and thrombin mobilize intracellular Ca2+ (Cai2+) were examined in UMR 106-H5 rat osteosarcoma cells. Bovine PTH-(1-34) (24 pM to 240 nM) produced a dose-dependent increase in Cai2+ (EC50, 3 nM), which returned to baseline within 75 sec. Human alpha-thrombin produced an increase in Cai2+ (ECmax, 10 U/ml) which was similar to that of PTH with respect to both magnitude and time course. Chelation of extracellular calcium with 5.0 mM EGTA did not alter the Cai2+ response to either PTH or thrombin. When added together at maximally effective concentrations, PTH and thrombin produced additive effects on Cai2+ in the presence and absence of EGTA. The additive effects of PTH and thrombin on Cai2+ were confirmed at the single cell level, using laser-based image analysis. Bradykinin (1 microM) produced a significant increase in Cai2+ in UMR 106-H5 cells which was of lesser magnitude than the peak 2- to 3-fold increase elicited by PTH or thrombin. Preexposure of cells to 10 U/ml thrombin for 2 min abolished the Cai2+ response to bradykinin, whereas preexposure to 240 nM PTH had no effect on the Cai2+ response to bradykinin. Thrombin elicited a rapid increase in the accumulation of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates (IP2 and IP3) in UMR 106-H5 cells, with increases in [3H]1,4,5-IP3 detectable as early as 15 sec after the addition of thrombin. Bradykinin increased [3H]IP production to a lesser extent than thrombin, whereas PTH neither increased [3H]IP accumulation nor potentiated the [3H]IP response to thrombin. The results suggest that thrombin and bradykinin mobilize Cai2+ from a shared IP3-responsive calcium pool, whereas PTH may use signals in addition to 1,4,5-IP3 to mobilize calcium from a distinct cellular calcium pool. Alternatively, specific calcium compartmentalization exists, and there is differential coupling of these agonists to the 1,4,5-IP3/Cai2+ pathway. \nDisturbed secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with persistent atrial standstill: endocrinologic silence. Persistent atrial standstill is a very rare pathophysiologic condition whose diagnosis is established when both electrical and mechanical silence of the atria are confirmed. To test the hypothesis that secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide is disturbed in patients with persistent atrial standstill, the response of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and other neurohormonal factors during exercise was investigated in three patients with a rate-responsive ventricular demand (VVI) pacemaker implanted for confirmed persistent atrial standstill. The results were compared with those observed in eight normal subjects and patients with a rate-responsive VVI (Group A) or atrial demand (AAI) (Group B) pacemaker implanted for confirmed sick sinus syndrome. Patients in Group A displayed significant elevation of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide secretion both before and during exercise (122.5 +/- 14.8 and 207.5 +/- 8.3 pg/ml, respectively) compared with those in Group B (55 +/- 14.1 and 116.4 +/- 51.5 pg/ml, respectively) and the normal subjects (18.9 +/- 9.8 and 30.8 +/- 19.2 pg/ml, respectively). This indicated development of a nonphysiologic increase in atrial volume or pressure overload, or both, in rate-responsive VVI pacing because of lack of atrioventricular synchrony. However, patients with persistent atrial standstill had undetectable (less than 10 pg/ml) or almost undetectable secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide as well as lower levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the circulation both before and during exercise. Changes in plasma catecholamines during exercise were similar in patients with persistent atrial standstill compared with the other groups. This study indicates that \"endocrinologic silence\" accompanies electrical and mechanical silence of the atria, which may constitute a third diagnostic clue to persistent atrial standstill. \nKinetics of Borrelia burgdorferi dissemination and evolution of disease after intradermal inoculation of mice. Borrelia burgdorferi dissemination to selected target organs was examined on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 21, and 30 after intradermal inoculation of 4-week-old C3H mice. Infection was determined by culture (blood, spleen, kidney, ear punch); polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for outer surface protein A (OSP A) DNA (ear punch); histology and spirochete histochemistry (spleen, kidney, skin, heart, joints); and OSP A DNA in situ hybridization (joints, heart). Blood or spleen of most mice were culture positive by day 3 and ear punch by day 10. Polymerase chain reaction performed on ear punches was also positive by day 10. Inflammation of joints and tendons began on days 4 through 7 and heart on days 7 through 10, which coincided with colonization of tissues with spirochetes. Spirochetes were multifocal in distribution, with a predilection for collagenous connective tissue of joints, heart, arteries, nerves, muscle, skin, and other tissues. Relative numbers of spirochetes peaked at 15 days, then decreased by 21 days. Gamma M immunoglobulin (IgM) antibody was detectable on immunoblots as early as day 4, with subsequent declining reactivity, and IgG antibody was detectable by day 7, with expanding reactivity to multiple antigens through day 30. \nEfficacy and toxicity of thromboxane synthetase inhibitor for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The efficacy and possible side effects of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthetase inhibitor in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were assessed for 24 patients who presented with grades I to IV of the Hunt and Hess classification. All patients underwent aneurysmal clipping within 48 hours after SAH. Postoperatively, TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, Cataclot [sodium (E)-3-[p-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)phenyl]-2-propenoate] was administered to 13 patients by continuous drip infusion at a dose of 1 microgram/kg/min for 8 to 14 days (group A). The remaining 11 patients did not receive this drug (group B). Of the 13 patients in group A, seven patients (54%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm after SAH. Four patients (31%) developed a transient deterioration of consciousness and/or motor disturbance. Three of these patients fully recovered, while one of them showed a mild neurological deficit on discharge. One patient (8%) developed permanent dysphasia and hemiparesis as a result of ischemic brain damage due to vasospasm. One patient (8%) died of the side effect. On the other hand, of the 11 patients in group B, only three (27%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm. One (9%) patient presented a transient neurological deficit but fully recovered upon discharge. Four patients (36%) showed permanent neurological deficits, although they all could lead an independent life after discharge. The three remaining patients developed a severe disturbance of consciousness caused by ischemia due to vasospasm, and two of them died within 1 month after the onset of SAH. In the group treated with Cataclot, two patients developed an epidural hematoma late during the administration of the drug. Of these two, one patient died of increased intracranial pressure that was accelerated by the complication. These results indicate that TXA2 synthetase inhibitor is effective in not only decreasing the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm but also reducing the neurological deterioration due to vasospasm after SAH. However, this drug has a hazardous side effect in that it may promote a tendency to bleed, which caused death in one of our patients. \nConstrictive pericarditis masquerading as Budd-Chiari syndrome. Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and constrictive pericarditis (CP) share many common clinical features. Over the last year we encountered three patients in whom CP clinically mimicked BCS. Two of the three did not even have raised jugular venous pressure. One patient with severe jaundice and hepatic coma ultimately died. Liver biopsy features were not discriminating. The final diagnosis of CP was established by echocardiography, chest computed tomography (CT), or cardiac catheterization. We conclude that in all patients with apparent BCS and atypical features, a noninvasive test like echocardiography or chest CT should be done to rule out treatable illness like CP before embarking on such invasive procedures as liver biopsy for diagnosis. \nCalcium and carcinogenesis of the mammary gland. Effects of dietary calcium on mammary carcinogenesis in rats were investigated because of evidence that calcium counteracts the promotion of colon cancer by dietary fat and because experimental diets for rats normally contain higher amounts of calcium and vitamin D than do human diets. Our earlier experiments indicated that yields of tumors induced in young, Sprague-Dawley rats by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene (DMBA) were higher when dietary calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D were decreased. Results of an experiment in which dietary amounts of calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D were varied independently suggested that phosphate and vitamin D have interactive effects with calcium. Another experiment in which dietary vitamin D alone was varied provided evidence that higher amounts inhibited tumorigenesis in the presence of low amounts of calcium and phosphate but the results with a high-calcium and -phosphate diet were inconclusive. The findings suggest that low amounts of dietary calcium and vitamin D and high amounts of phosphate increase susceptibility to DMBA-induced mammary neoplasia. \nHuman beta-galactosidase gene mutations in GM1-gangliosidosis: a common mutation among Japanese adult/chronic cases. Molecular analysis of the human beta-galactosidase gene revealed six different mutations in 10 of 11 Japanese GM1-gangliosidosis patients. They were the only abnormalities in each allele examined in this study. A 165-nucleotide duplication (positions 1103-1267) was found in two infantile patients, producing an abnormally large mRNA; one patient was probably a homozygote, and the other was a heterozygote of this mutation. The other two infantile patients had different mutations; a 123 Gly(GGG)----Arg(AGG) mutation in one patient and a 316 Tyr(TAT)----Cys(TGT) mutation in the other. A 201 Arg(CGC)----Cys(TGC) mutation, eliminating a BspMI site, was detected in a late-infantile/juvenile patient; the restriction-site analysis of amplified genomic DNA confirmed his heterozygosity for this mutation. A 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation was found in all five adult/chronic patients examined in this study. It created a SauI site, and restriction-site analysis confirmed that four patients were homozygous mutants. The other was a compound heterozygote for this mutation and another 457 Arg(CGA)----Gln(CAA) mutation. These mutant genes expressed markedly decreased or completely deficient enzyme activities in beta-galactosidase-deficient human fibroblasts transformed by adenovirus-SV40 recombinants. We conclude that gene mutations are heterogeneous in GM1-gangliosidosis but that the 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation is common among the Japanese adult/chronic cases. Genotype-phenotype correlations in GM1-gangliosidosis are briefly discussed. \nShort- and long-term psychological status following stroke. Short form MMPI results. Indices of self-reported depression and psychological adjustment after stroke were evaluated using a short form of the MMPI. Patients with poststroke periods of 2 to 6 and 7 to 24 months were selected, and indices of general intellectual functioning and lesion size/location were obtained. Despite similar levels of intellectual functioning and lesion parameters, the longer duration group showed significantly higher depression scores and significant (T greater than 70) elevations on several other clinical scales of the MMPI. In contrast, the mean overall profile of the short-duration group was roughly within normal limits. These findings have implications for the clinical assessment and treatment of stroke patients and long-term psychological adjustment after stroke. \nPerioperative stroke. Part I: General surgery, carotid artery disease, and carotid endarterectomy. Although stroke, defined as a focal neurological deficit lasting more than 24 hr, is uncommon in the perioperative period, its associated mortality and long-term disability are high. No large-scale data are available to identify the importance of recognized risk factors for stroke in the perioperative period. A review of the literature shows that the incidence and mechanism of its occurrence are influenced by the presence of cardiovascular disease and the type of surgery. The most common cause of perioperative stroke is embolism. In non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of perioperative stroke is higher among the elderly. Properly administered, controlled hypotension is associated with minimal risk of stroke. Cerebral vasospasm may be the cause of focal cerebral ischaemia in eclamptic patients, and the aggressive treatment of hypertension may exacerbate the neurological damage. The risk of stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy is closely related to the preoperative neurological presentation, and the experience of the surgical/anaesthetic team. Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, acute stroke, asymptomatic carotid lesions, preoperative assessment of risk, local and general anaesthesia, cerebral protection and monitoring during carotid endarterectomy are discussed with reference to reducing the risk of perioperative stroke. Adequate monitoring and protection have minimized the risk of ischaemia from carotid clamping, and the major mechanism of stroke is embolization. \nProtein status and metabolic expenditure determine the response to intravenous nutrition--a new classification of surgical malnutrition. To determine whether nutritional and metabolic factors affect the response to intravenous nutrition (IVN) 146 surgical patients were classified according to their protein and metabolic status using direct measurements of body protein and metabolic expenditure. The patients were grouped into four categories: category I, moderate to severe protein depletion without raised metabolic expenditure; category II, moderate to severe protein depletion with raised metabolic expenditure; category III, mild protein depletion without raised metabolic expenditure; and category IV, mild protein depletion with raised metabolic expenditure. After 2 weeks of IVN patients in category I gained a mean(s.e.m.) of 0.43(0.06) kg of body protein (P less than 0.001) and had significant rises in both plasma transferrin and prealbumin (P less than 0.05); patients in category II gained 0.30(0.11) kg of protein (P less than 0.005) and also had significant rises in transferrin and prealbumin (P less than 0.05). Patients in category III lost 0.24(0.11) kg protein (P less than 0.05) and had no changes in either transferrin or prealbumin and patients in category IV lost 0.51(0.13) kg of body protein (P less than 0.001) and although there was a significant rise in plasma prealbumin there was no significant change in plasma transferrin. When postoperative patients were examined separately, they did not differ significantly from preoperative patients except in category I, where their protein gain was only 0.19(0.10) kg, an amount not significantly different from that gained by patients in category II. In each of the four categories described, the changes in total body protein occurring with 2 weeks of IVN were determined by the relative effects of two competing processes; protein depletion and raised metabolic expenditure. With moderate to severe protein depletion (approximately 30 per cent depletion of body protein stores) there was a marked tendency to gain protein with IVN. When the patient had a raised metabolic expenditure or was postoperative this tendency of depleted patients to gain protein was still present but it was less. With only mild protein depletion (approximately 10 per cent depletion) increases in metabolic expenditure made it difficult, if not impossible, to prevent continuing protein loss in spite of aggressive nutritional support. The patient categories we have described determine the response to IVN and form the basis of a new clinical classification of surgical malnutrition. \nMalignancy and chronic wounds: Marjolin's ulcer. Malignancy in chronic wounds is not uncommon and has been reported as occurring in chronic scars of diverse causes. We report an unusual case of bilateral thermal injuries of the lower extremities that 40 years later presented as very large, painful, fungating wounds of both lower legs. After histologic confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma, eradication of the disease required amputations of both the lower extremities and reconstructive procedures. In addition, we discuss current theories regarding the mechanism of malignant degeneration in chronic wounds and evaluate treatment on the basis of information currently available in the literature. \nEndoscopic sphincterotomy: the whole truth. An 8 year experience of 602 patients (median age 76 years) referred for endoscopic management of common bile stones is reported. No patient referred for treatment has been excluded. A diagnostic cholangiogram was achieved in 94 per cent and sphincterotomy was accomplished in 91.5 per cent. The bile ducts were demonstrated to be completely cleared of stones in 491 (81.6 per cent) of 602 patients. A mean number of 1.9 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography examinations per patient were necessary to achieve this result. Complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy, which were strictly defined, occurred in 10.5 per cent of patients although five patients had two complications (total complication rate 11.3 per cent). The 30-day mortality rate was 2.2 per cent, seven of 13 deaths (1.2 per cent) occurring as a direct result of sphincterotomy. There have been statistically significant improvements in bile duct clearance and complication rates with increasing experience of endoscopists. \nProlonged paralysis after treatment with neuromuscular junction blocking agents. OBJECTIVES: Previous reports have described prolonged paralysis after treatment with neuromuscular junction blocking agents in critically ill patients. The purpose of this study was to further describe a group of patients who developed prolonged weakness after treatment with these agents. DESIGN: Clinical information, electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology results are described in this group of patients. Clinical information includes diagnoses, dosage of neuromuscular junction blocker, other medications affecting the neuromuscular system, and neuromuscular examination and clinical course. SETTING: All patients were seen in the ICUs of three local hospitals. PATIENTS: Included were critically ill patients with a variety of diagnoses, all of whom developed severe weakness after discontinuation of neuromuscular junction blocking agents. INTERVENTIONS: Electrodiagnostic studies and muscle biopsies were performed on several of the patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients had pronounced weakness without sensory loss. Electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology findings were consistent with failed neuromuscular transmission. Although many patients had disorders or were taking medications that can injure the neuromuscular system, no disorder or medication was common to all. Recovery of strength often took several months and most patients were slow to wean from mechanical ventilator support. CONCLUSIONS: Although alternative explanations cannot be excluded with certainty, the use of neuromuscular junction blocking agents may lead to neurogenic atrophy and care must be taken when using them. \nInflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen. Morphological, radiological, immunophenotypic, and ultrastructural features. A case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen is described. Its rapid enlargement, demonstrable by ultrasound studies and computed tomographic scan, its gross appearance, and some of its histologic features suggested malignant lymphoma. However, a characteristic circumferential zonal pattern and polytypic immunophenotype helped to establish the correct diagnosis. In retrospect, the zonal pattern was also identified radiologically. \nRegulation of the oncodevelopmental expression of type 1 chain ABH and Lewis(b) blood group antigens in human colon by alpha-2-L-fucosylation. Blood group antigen expression in the distal human colon is related to the development of the organ and is modified by malignant transformation. To elucidate the biochemical basis for these changes, we have (a) analysed the activity of glycosyltransferases coded for by the H, Se, Le, X, and A genes, in tissue biopsy specimens from normal and malignant proximal and distal human colon; (b) characterised the glycosphingolipids expressed in the various regions of normal and malignant colon by immunostaining of high performance thin layer chromatography plates; and (c) located the antigens on tissue sections from the same subjects by immunohistochemistry. In both secretors and non-secretors we found a significantly higher activity of alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases in carcinomatous rectal tissue than in tissue from normal subjects, whereas the other transferase activities studied showed no significant differences. The acceptor substrate specificity suggested that both the Se and the H gene dependent alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases are increased in carcinomas. In non-malignant tissue the only enzyme which showed appreciably higher activity in caecum than in rectum was alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase. Immunochemistry and immunohistochemistry showed alpha-2-L-fucosylated structures in normal caecum from secretors and in tumour tissue from both secretors and non-secretors. We conclude that the alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases control the expression of ABH, and Lewis(b) structures in normal and malignant colon. \nFollow-up study of unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery. A follow-up study of unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery was performed. During the 10-year period from 1979 to 1989, there were 22 patients with 24 aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. All 24 aneurysms were unruptured. They represented 3% of all intracranial aneurysms and 11% of all internal carotid artery aneurysms diagnosed at the hospital during the 10-year period. Eighteen patients were women and 4 were men. Their ages ranged from 34 to 82 years (mean 63.3 years). Of the 22 patients, 12 (55%) had multiple aneurysms. A follow-up study without treatment was made in 15 of the 22 patients who had a total of 16 unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. This study excluded 7 of the 22 patients with a total of eight aneurysms because of operation or death soon after diagnosis. The average maximal dimension of the 16 aneurysms was 5 mm, with a range of 2-17 mm. Follow-up periods varied from 11 months to 10.5 years, with an average of 4.7 years. During this period, none of the 16 aneurysms ruptured, and they remained asymptomatic, except for one aneurysm that had been discovered as a result of the cavernous sinus syndrome. Some surgeons are now attempting direct operations on intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms, even if the aneurysms are unruptured and relatively small. \nAbdominal aortic aneurysms complicated by spontaneous iliocaval or duodenal fistulae. Seven hundred and twenty one abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated between 1960 and 1985. Twenty one of these (2.9%) were complicated by the development of a spontaneous primary fistula, 16 (2.2%) into the vena cava or iliac veins and 5 (0.7%) into the duodenum. A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only four instances, two aorto-caval and two aorto-duodenal fistulae. Hospital mortality was 44% for aorto-caval and 60% for aorto-duodenal fistulae. Despite the lack of a precise preoperative diagnosis in the majority of cases, the prognosis for aorto-caval fistula remained comparable to that for patients undergoing emergency surgery for uncomplicated ruptured aortic aneurysms. The mortality of spontaneous aorto-duodenal fistulae was appreciably higher and the aneurysmal contents of 4 out of these 5 cases had positive bacterial cultures. \nA case of intracerebral air embolism secondary to the insertion of a Hickman line. Complications following the insertion of intravenous catheters are relatively uncommon. We report a potentially serious, hitherto unrecognized complication of Hickman line insertion, and discuss the condition. \nIsolation and direct characterization of resident microglial cells from the normal and inflamed central nervous system. In addition to the major population of infiltrating leukocytes recovered from inflamed rat central nervous system (CNS), all of which expressed high levels of leukocyte common antigen CD45, many cells were coisolated that were MRC OX42+ (complement receptor 3/CD11b) but expressed low-to-moderate levels of CD45 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Most cells from normal CNS, in contrast, lay within this latter, CD45low population. From previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated CD45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. Using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating CD45, CD4, and MHC class I molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of MHC class II molecules. A 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed CNS provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. In normal CNS, a very small population of blood-derived CD45high-expressing cells are present; most MHC class II expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia. \nGrading of human urothelial carcinoma based on nuclear atypia and mitotic frequency. I. Histological description. The World Health Organization (WHO) grade II bladder tumors constitute a clinically and histologically heterogeneous group due to imprecise histological definitions. In an attempt to improve this problem 124 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder were histologically reviewed using a modified Bergkvist system. The grade II tumors were divided into 2 groups, grades IIa and IIb, mainly with reference to the degree of nuclear atypia and number of mitoses. Using definitions possible to express by numerical means, the separation was easy and reproducible. Due to great histological resemblance between certain close grades we propose a new grading system with 3 grades combining I and IIa (grade A), IIb and III (grade B), and a third group (grade C) for the anaplastic tumors. \nTypical and atypical bronchopulmonary carcinoids. A clinicopathologic and flow cytometric study. The clinicopathologic and flow cytometric characteristics of 47 bronchopulmonary carcinoids were assessed, relative to patient survival. Aneuploidy was associated more often with tumor size of greater than or equal to 3.0 cm (P less than 0.004) and lymph node (P less than 0.013) or vascular involvement (P less than 0.004). Also, an aneuploid DNA content was seen significantly more often in histologically atypical (79%) than in typical carcinoid neoplasms (18%) (P less than 0.0001). Cox proportional hazard model analysis revealed that the histologic category (typical vs. atypical) and ploidy pattern were important prognostic indicators. Size of the primary tumor and the presence of vascular involvement were also significant predictors of outcome. Histologically atypical carcinoids with diploid DNA content pursued a less aggressive course than did their aneuploid counterparts. \nDown's syndrome and mixed acute leukemia in infants. The routine use of panels of monoclonal antibodies has been complementary to the French-American-British (FAB) leukemia classification, and has unmasked the occurrence of mixed acute leukemia (myeloid-lymphoid). It is widely accepted that children with Down's syndrome (DS) have a high incidence of acute leukemia. There is an extensive body of literature emphasizing the cytogenetic findings in these children. However, information as to the immunophenotype is often limited to the lymphoid surface determinants. The authors report two children with DS whose leukemic blasts were studied with a panel of 17 monoclonal antibodies (myeloid, lymphoid, and megakaryocytic) by flow cytometric examination and were classified as biphenotypic acute leukemia. The blast population coexpressed myeloid and T-cell surface markers. The lymphoid origin was ruled out on the basis of negative terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and molecular analysis demonstrating germline configuration for the JH and beta TCR genes. \nThe impact of breast-conserving treatment and mastectomy on the quality of l",
