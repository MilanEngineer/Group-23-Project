        "text": "ing infusions of procainamide HCl at 50 mg/min (loading) and 8 mg/min (maintenance). At the end of the loading infusion, mean arterial pressure (MAP) had decreased from 88.5 +/- 2.4 (mean +/- SEM) to 81.5 +/- 3.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), central venous pressure from 6.7 +/- 0.7 to 5.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), forearm vascular resistance (FVR) from 28 +/- 4.8 to 22.3 +/- 5.1 resistance units (p less than 0.05), and SNA from 259 +/- 47 to 94 +/- 26 units/min (p less than 0.05). These changes persisted during the maintenance infusion. Increased levels of SNA, FVR, and MAP provoked by the cold pressor test were reduced significantly by intravenous procainamide. In eight other subjects, intravenous procainamide HCl (15 mg/kg at 50 mg/min) caused dose-dependent inhibition of SNA that reversed as blood concentrations fell during drug washout. To determine if procainamide causes direct vasodilation, in nine subjects, graded infusions were delivered into the brachial artery at doses that produced no systemic effect. Ipsilateral FVR tended to increase during local intra-arterial infusion of procainamide. These data show that intravenous procainamide causes hypotension, vasodilation, and sympathetic withdrawal. Vasodilation does not result from a direct vasorelaxant effect of the drug. \nSepsis after coronary bypass grafting: evidence for loss of the gut mucosal barrier. Postoperative infections may originate from a patient's gastrointestinal tract. We studied infections after coronary artery revascularization. Three hundred twenty-nine patients underwent coronary artery revascularization from January 1987 to March 1990. Eight of the 329 (2.4%) died; none of the deaths were infection related. Fifty-five culture-proven infections were identified in 22 of 321 survivors (6.8%); 9 infections (16%) were gram-positive, 5 (9%) were fungal, and 41 (75%) were gram-negative. Site of infections were respiratory tract, 58%; urinary tract, 18%; blood, 13%; and mediastinum, 11%. Ninety-six percent of respiratory tract and all urinary tract infections were gram-negative or fungal. There was no significant difference between infected and noninfected groups in sex, age, smoking history, preoperative hematocrit or leukocyte count, serum albumin level, or time on extracorporeal bypass. The infected group required intubation and nasogastric suction for a significantly longer time than the noninfected group (p less than 0.001). Time to enteral alimentation was significantly longer in the infected group (p less than 0.02). We were unable to correlate the number of infections with the lengths of intubation, nasogastric suction, or time to enteral alimentation. This study supports the concept of postoperative infections arising from bacterial translocation across the patient's gastrointestinal tract. The most significant risk factor is the length of the gastrointestinal tract disuse. \nPercutaneous transjugular portosystemic shunt. OBJECTIVE.--To determine the effectiveness of the Palmaz balloon expandable stent for the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The device is designed to achieve portal decompression in patients with variceal hemorrhage secondary to portal hypertension. DESIGN.--Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting was performed in eight patients during a 9-month period. Mean follow-up was 5 months. PATIENTS.--All patients had cirrhosis with portal hypertension and varices. Bleeding occurred in seven patients from esophageal varices and in one patient from hemorrhoids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Shunt patency and recurrent variceal hemorrhage. RESULTS.--Shunts created from a transjugular approach between a hepatic and a portal vein (diameters of 8 to 12 mm) lowered the average portosystemic pressure gradient from 36 to 11 mm Hg. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.7 days. Complete variceal decompression after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement was identified endoscopically in all eight patients. The patient treated for hemorrhoids rebled and was treated successfully by transfemoral balloon expansion of the shunt diameter from 8 to 12 mm. All shunts were patent at 1 to 9 months (mean, 5 months) of follow-up. CONCLUSION.--Initial results suggest that transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is a safe and effective method of portal decompression for the treatment of variceal hemorrhage. \nPhase I and pharmacokinetic trial of intraperitoneal etoposide in combination with the multidrug-resistance-modulating agent dipyridamole. Dipyridamole synergistically enhances the sensitivity of human ovarian carcinoma cells to etoposide in vitro. We conducted a phase I trial to investigate the feasibility of using dipyridamole to selectively increase the sensitivity to etoposide of tumors confined to the peritoneal cavity. Etoposide and dipyridamole were administered as a continuous 72-hour intraperitoneal infusion to 16 patients. The maximum tolerated dose of etoposide was 175 mg/m2 per day when administered with dipyridamole at a fixed dose of 24 mg/m2 per day. Dose-limiting toxic effects were leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. No other major toxic effects were observed. The free peritoneal etoposide and dipyridamole concentrations varied with the etoposide dose rate, reaching 218.9 and 25.3 microM, respectively, at an etoposide dose rate of 175 mg/m2 per day. The free etoposide and dipyridamole concentrations attained were well within the range needed for synergistic interaction. \nIdentification of 17 independent mutations responsible for human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency. Complete hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency causes the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an X-linked, purine metabolism disorder manifested by hyperuricemia, hyperuricaciduria, and neurologic dysfunction. Partial HPRT deficiency causes hyperuricemia and gout. One requirement for understanding the molecular basis of HPRT deficiency is the determination of which amino acids in this salvage enzyme are necessary for structural or catalytic competence. In this study we have used the PCR coupled with direct sequencing to determine the nucleotide and subsequent amino acid changes in 22 subjects representing 17 unrelated kindreds from the United Kingdom. These mutations were confirmed by using either RNase mapping or Southern analyses. In addition, experiments were done to determine enzyme activity and electrophoretic mobility, and predictive paradigms were used to study the impact of these amino acid substitutions on secondary structure. \nInvolvement of neutrophils in postischaemic damage to the small intestine. Haemorrhagic mucosal lesions are produced during intestinal ischaemia and after reperfusion probably mediated by oxygen radicals. Oxygen radicals react with cell membrane lipids and induce cell damage by peroxidation and induce accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the tissue. The aim of the study was to elucidate the involvement of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in post-ischaemic intestinal damage. Intestinal ischaemia was induced in cats by partial occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. Samples from the small intestine were excised before and at the end of the two hour hypotensive period as well as 10 minutes and 60 minutes after reperfusion. Conjugated dienes, myeloperoxidase, and the purine metabolites were determined in the samples. The tissue was also examined histologically. Seven cats were treated before reperfusion with a monoclonal antibody (IB4) which inhibits leucocyte adherence to endothelial cells and its subsequent activation. After reperfusion myeloperoxidase activity increased and the ischaemic mucosal lesions worsened significantly. IB4 treatment prevented an increase in post-hypotensive myeloperoxidase activity and attenuated the normally observed severe mucosal lesions. We conclude that the severe post-ischaemic lesions are induced by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Such mucosal injury may be appreciably reduced by blocking leucocyte adherence with IB4. \nSignificance of atherosclerotic changes of the ascending aorta during coronary bypass surgery with intraoperative detection by echography. Intraoperative echographic studies of the ascending aorta were carried out on 100 of 222 patients having primary coronary bypass surgeries between May 1987 and December 1988. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of echographic study in evaluating the nature of atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta and its incidence and relationship to perioperative cerebrovascular complications in coronary bypass surgery. It was possible to obtain clear echographic images of the aortic wall in these 100 patients which were divided into two groups according to the degree of the degenerative process. Three of 13 patients (23%) (Group II) with severe atherosclerotic changes, suffered perioperative cerebrovascular complications, and early surgical mortality in 2 patients (15%) was caused by cerebrovascular complications. These complications were not seen in 87 patients with less than moderate atherosclerotic changes (Group I). \nGenetic dissection of susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in inbred mice. Mice of some inbred strains, such as 21-day-old DBA/2J mice, have generalized convulsions when exposed to intense auditory stimulation. Analysis of susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in BXD recombinant inbred strains has demonstrated the influence of at least three loci. One locus, Asp-1, is located on chromosome 12 between Ah and D12Nyu1; another locus, Asp-2, is on chromosome 4, tightly linked to b. Here we report evidence that Asp-2 is located within an 8-centimorgan segment distal to b and that Asp-3 is linked to Mtv-1 on chromosome 7. We also present evidence that these three loci account for most of the heritable variation in susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in crosses of DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice and that susceptibility to audiogenic seizures is influenced by genomic imprinting. Thus, genomic imprinting may complicate linkage and mapping studies and should be considered in analyses of complex modes of inheritance. \nGenetic analysis of microtubule motor proteins in Drosophila: a mutation at the ncd locus is a dominant enhancer of nod. The nod (no distributive disjunction) and the ncd (non-claret disjunctional) mutations are both female-specific, recessive meiotic mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations at either locus show high frequencies of nondisjunction at meiosis I and both have been shown to encode kinesin-like proteins. Unlike the ncd mutation, which affects all chromosome pairs, the nod mutation affects only the disjunction of nonexchange chromosomes. Although both the nod and ncd mutations are fully recessive, females doubly heterozygous for nod and ncd mutations show levels of X and fourth chromosome nondisjunction that are 6- to 35-fold above those observed in control females. Exchange between chromosomes can suppress this effect; thus, only nonexchange chromosomes segregating via the distributive system are sensitive in double heterozygotes. Since the phenotype of double heterozygotes mimics that of the nod mutation, we infer that ncd is a dominant enhancer of nod. Failure of ncd to fully complement nod reveals the chromosome segregation machinery to be dosage sensitive. The probability that the distributive system will fail is enhanced in females simultaneously haploinsufficient at the nod and ncd loci. \nForce-velocity and 30-s Wingate tests in boys at high and low altitudes. The effects of high altitude (HA, 3,700 m) on performance during a force-velocity test (maximal anaerobic power, MAnP) and a 30-s Wingate test (mean power, P) were studied in boys 7-15 yr of age. Forty-seven children acclimatized to HA were compared with 101 living at low altitude (LA, 330 m). They had the same good nutritional status and the same level of physical activities [average 5.4 +/- 1.1 (SD) and 5.2 +/- 1.9 h/wk at HA and LA, respectively]. They performed the two tests using the same calibrated cycle ergometer. For the Wingate test, O2 uptake (VO2) during the 30 s and the peak of blood lactate concentration ([L]p) during the recovery were also measured. No difference in MAnP was observed between HA and LA. P, [L]p, and VO2 were lower at HA. This suggests that the altitude of 3,700 m did not affect the performance of the force-velocity test but reduced that of the Wingate test. This decrease in P was linked to a lower participation of glycolysis and aerobic metabolism. The latter is related to a reduced aerobic performance at HA. In addition, the slopes of the relationships between age and MAnP, P, and [L]p were the same at HA and LA, indicating that chronic hypoxia did not alter the development of the anaerobic metabolism during puberty. \nImportance of ulceration of carotid plaque in determining symptoms of cerebral ischemia. In order to investigate the relationship between carotid plaque morphology and symptoms of cerebral ischemia, a prospective clinicopathological study was performed. Ninety consecutive intact carotid plaques obtained from surgery and 43 carotid plaques from cadavers without symptoms of cerebral ischemia were evaluated. Ulceration and mural thrombus were the only morphologic findings statistically correlated to the presence of hemispheric symptoms (p less than 0.02). Intramural hemorrhage was more common in patients with hemispheric symptoms but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31). Plaque causing high degree stenosis had a higher incidence of intramural hemorrhage (p = 0.04) and ulceration (p less than 0.02). Ulceration of plaque plays a major role in the onset of hemispheric symptoms. The results of our study support the hypothesis that in the majority of the cases, hemispheric symptoms are embolic in nature. \nRole of a soy-based lactose-free formula in the outpatient management of diarrhea. The introduction of a soy-based, lactose-free formula during the acute phase of diarrheal illness in infants has been shown to reduce stool output and duration of diarrhea in hospitalized patients. In the United States, most infants with acute diarrhea are treated as outpatients. In the present study, infants with diarrhea who were treated as outpatients were randomly assigned to receive either a soy-based, lactose-free formula alternating with oral rehydration solution from the beginning of therapy (\"early feeding\") or oral rehydration solution alone for the first 24 hours of therapy, followed by a soy-based, lactose-free formula alternating with oral rehydration solution (control group). Twenty-nine infants were randomly assigned to the early-feeding group and 27 to the control group. Twenty-one (72%) of 29 in the early-feeding group resolved their diarrhea at the end of 48 hours of therapy compared with 12 (44%) of 27 in the group fed oral rehydration solution only (P = .02). It is concluded that the introduction of a soy-based, lactose-free formula from the beginning of therapy for acute diarrhea in children treated as outpatients is safe and may shorten duration of diarrhea while maintaining adequate caloric intake. \nIdentification of spirochetes related to Treponema pallidum in necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and chronic periodontitis. BACKGROUND. Spirochetes are commonly associated with periodontal disease, but it is not known whether these treponemes are pathogenic or merely opportunistic. We sought to determine whether spirochetes present in periodontal disease share antigens thought to be unique to spirochetes that are known pathogens. METHODS. We examined dental plaque from 24 healthy subjects, from ulcerative sites in 17 patients with ulcerative gingivitis, and from areas of involvement in 19 patients with chronic periodontitis, using an immunocyto-chemical technique with monoclonal antibodies against pathogen-specific determinants on 47-kd and 37-kd molecules from Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Serum was tested against T. pallidum by immunoblotting and by serologic assays for syphilis. RESULTS. Spirochetes with a pathogen-specific epitope on a 47-kd molecule were not found in plaque samples from any of the 24 healthy subjects, but they were identified in plaque samples from 11 of 17 patients with ulcerative gingivitis (P less than 0.001) and from 10 of 19 patients with periodontitis (P less than 0.01). Monoclonal antibodies directed against a 37-kd molecule reacted with spirochetes in plaque samples from 1 of 14 controls, from all 11 patients with gingivitis from whom samples could be obtained (P less than 0.001), and from 14 of 19 patients with periodontitis (P less than 0.001). Five of 18 normal subjects had IgG against 47-kd and 37-kd molecules, but none had IgG against 14-kd or 12-kd molecules from T. pallidum subspecies pallidum. Among 19 patients with ulcerative gingivitis, IgG was identified against 47-kd molecules in 15, against 37-kd molecules in 12, against 14-kd molecules in 4, and against 12-kd molecules in 15. CONCLUSIONS. The spirochetes found in dental plaque from patients with ulcerative gingivitis or chronic periodontitis have antigens that are thought to be unique to pathogenic treponemes. This close antigenic relation suggests that T. pallidum or a closely related organism may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. \nTissue injury caused by deposition of immune complexes is L-arginine dependent. Nitric oxide (NO.), a free radical that is generated from L-arginine by stimulated endothelial cells, neutrophils, activated macrophages, and other cell types, reacts with superoxide anion (O2.-) to form peroxynitrite, which itself may be tissue toxic or can then react further to form the highly reactive and toxic hydroxyl radical (HO.). Because vascular injury produced by tissue deposition of immune complexes is linked to formation of toxic products derived from activated neutrophils, we have assessed whether immune complex-induced injury of rat lung and dermal vasculature is arginine dependent. The arginine analogue, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (N-MeArg), which blocks NO. formation, protects against immune complex-induced vascular injury in rats. The protective effects of N-MeArg are reversed by the presence of L-arginine but not D-arginine. Additionally, in the absence of N-MeArg, injury is enhanced by the presence of L-arginine but not by D-arginine. Protection by N-MeArg is not associated with diminished recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from animals undergoing immune complex deposition in lung contain the decomposition products of NO.--namely, nitrite and nitrate. In the presence of N-MeArg these products are greatly diminished. These data suggest that immune complex-induced injury of rat lung and skin is L-arginine dependent. These data also suggest that in vivo metabolic products of L-arginine, such as NO(.), are directly or indirectly linked to immune complex-induced tissue injury. \nPlasma postheparin diamine oxidase in patients with small intestinal lymphoma. Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme located almost exclusively in villus tip enterocytes. Its plasma activity is enhanced by intravenous heparin which releases the enzymes from small bowel enterocytes into the blood. Plasma postheparin DAO (PHD) values have been shown to be significantly lower in patients with malabsorption and villous atrophy, thus suggesting that PHD reflects the mature enterocytic mass. In this study we have assayed PHD in five patients with small bowel lymphoma (two with immunoproliferative small intestinal disease [IPSID] and three with non-IPSID lymphoma) associated with malabsorption syndrome and small bowel mucosa atrophy. The PHD test was performed at diagnosis, after partial or complete remission induced by chemotherapy, and during the follow-up. The PHD values, very low at diagnosis (0.66 +/- 0.12 U/ml), increased during chemotherapy and reached the normal range (greater than 3.7 U/ml) when complete remission occurred. The PHD values rapidly and consistently decreased whenever the disease relapsed. Our data indicate that in patients with small bowel lymphoma PHD test is a sensitive marker of small bowel mucosa damage and suggest that it could be useful in monitoring the recovery of mucosal lesions induced by chemotherapy. \nComparison of acute and chronic protein-energy malnutrition on host antitumor immune mechanisms. Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) is prevalent in cancer patients. However, the effect of PCM on anti-tumor immunity is unclear and critically important in an era of improving results with adoptive immunotherapy. This study examined the effect of short- and long-term PCM on tumor-specific and natural immune effector mechanisms in a murine neuroblastoma (C1300 NRB) model. A/J mice received an isocaloric 2.5% or 24% casein diet for 3 or 8 weeks before inoculation with tumor. Three weeks later lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested for determination of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Both 3 and 8 weeks of PCM significantly reduced mean total body weight by 25% (p less than 0.001) and 41% (p less than 0.001), respectively, compared with regularly nourished mice. Short-term PCM did not inhibit CTL or NK cytotoxicity, whereas long-term PCM significantly diminished CTL generation (p less than 0.001) but preserved NK cytotoxic function. These results indicate that CTL development against autologous tumor, in contrast to basal NK function, is dependent on host nutritional status. Mean tumor growth, determined by tumor-weight to carcass-weight ratio, was unchanged for both short- and long-term protein-energy deprived groups compared with results in regularly nourished mice. These findings suggest that NK function is the predominant effector mechanism inhibiting C1300 NRB growth and that NK tumoricidal capacity is preserved during PCM. \nSingle vs. double stapling technique in colorectal surgery. A prospective randomized trial. Seventy patients after rectosigmoid resection were randomized to a rectal anastomosis either in the single or double stapling technique. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. A trend in favor of the double stapling technique was noted: 2.8 percent clinical leaks vs. 8.6 percent in the single stapling technique. \nFollicular mucinosis: histopathologic review of 33 cases. Among 33 patients with the histologic diagnosis of follicular mucinosis (alopecia mucinosa) made at our institution between 1982 and 1989, 9 had mycosis fungoides diagnosed concomitantly. Three other patients had lymphoproliferative disorders, and two had Kaposi's sarcoma. Analysis of biopsy features such as epidermal lymphocytic exocytosis, periappendageal infiltrate, and deposition of mucin revealed no predominant finding that distinguished a benign course from mycosis fungoides. A predominance of eosinophils in the infiltrate was suggestive of benign follicular mucinosis rather than mycosis fungoides. Gene rearrangement studies detected three clones in three patients with follicular mucinosis; two were in patients with mycosis fungoides, and one was in a patient with dermatitis. The outcome of these three patients is pending further follow-up. No histopathologic or clinical features distinguished these patients from the others. \nCSF changes in a longitudinal study of 124 neurologically normal HIV-1-infected U.S. Air Force personnel. Over a 2 year period, 124 neurologically normal HIV-1-infected patients had three successive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations approximately 1 year apart. Immunological status as measured by absolute CD4 counts in the blood identified two groups of patients over time: (a) a group with progressive CD4 decline (66 patients), and (b) a group with stable CD4 counts (58 patients). These two study groups provided us the opportunity to compare CSF changes (cells, protein, albumin index, IgG, IgG index, and IgG synthesis rate) in neurologically normal individuals with respect to immunological status over time. We found significantly increased intrathecal cellular response and IgG production over time independent of CD4 group. We conclude that any clinical study comparing CSF findings in neurologically symptomatic HIV-infected individuals must recognize and control for these CSF changes in neurologically asymptomatic patients. \nTolerance of the carotid-sheath contents to brachytherapy: an experimental study. Tumor invasion of the carotid artery is a potential indication for brachytherapy, which delivers a high dose of irradiation to residual tumor while limiting the dose to adjacent healthy tissues. The tolerance of carotid-sheath contents to varying doses of brachytherapy, however, has not been clearly established. In order to evaluate brachytherapy effects on carotid-sheath contents, after-loading catheters were implanted bilaterally in 3 groups of 6 rabbits each (18 rabbits). Iridium 192 brachytherapy doses of either 5000 cGy (rad), 9000 cGy, or 13,000 cGy were delivered unilaterally, with the contralateral neck serving as a nonirradiated control in each animal. There were no carotid ruptures and wound healing was normal. Two animals from each group were killed at 6, 20, and 48 weeks. Even at the highest dose (13,000 cGy), nerve conduction studies performed on the vagus nerve prior to sacrifice revealed no increased latency, histologic changes were minimal, and carotid arteries were patent. These observations suggest that the carotid-sheath contents in healthy rabbits could tolerate high doses (up to 13,000 cGy) of low-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy without complications. \nSynovial fluid immunocytology in the diagnosis of leukemic synovitis. We describe a patient with leukemic synovitis complicating acute lymphoplastic leukemia. Leukemic cells were identified in the synovial fluid by an indirect immunofluorescent technique using monoclonal antibodies against early B cell antigens. Since focal leukemic lesions may be missed in synovial biopsy specimens, immunocytological analysis of joint fluids may facilitate early diagnosis of leukemic arthritis. \nEchinococcosis (Hydatid disease): lessons from experience with 59 patients. The records of 59 patients with echinococcal hydatid disease were reviewed. Ultrasonic and computed tomographic imaging were found to be the most reliable diagnostic procedures. Thirty-seven patients with large symptomatic cysts underwent surgery. Most often, conservative extraction of the inner embryonic membranes proved effective, but cysts not extensively involving vital structures were totally excised. Cetrimide became the local scolecidal agent of choice; a role for albendazole in systemic chemotherapy is anticipated. Elective surgery in 30 patients was safe, but urgent surgery in seven patients with acute complications from cyst rupture was followed by substantial morbidity and mortality. \nAbnormal automatic rhythms in ischemic Purkinje fibers are modulated by a specific alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype. BACKGROUND. Recent advances in adrenergic pharmacology have made possible the identification of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes using the specific blockers chloroethylclonidine and WB 4101. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, we used these two blockers to determine the mechanisms responsible for automatic rhythms occurring during simulated ischemia and reperfusion of isolated canine Purkinje fibers. Experiments were done in the presence of propranolol to minimize beta-adrenergic contributions to the rhythms studied. In the control situation, all fibers showed membrane potentials greater than -90 mV and normal automatic rhythms. During simulated ischemia, membrane potential depolarized to the -60 mV range. Abnormal automaticity was seen in 20% of fibers not treated with phenylephrine and in 50% of those superfused with 1 x 10(-7) M phenylephrine. The incidence of abnormal automaticity was reduced to 0% by WB 4101 (which blocks phosphoinositide metabolic effects of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the heart) and was increased to 90% by chloroethylclonidine (which blocks Na-K pump-stimulating effects of alpha-agonists). Moreover, the ischemic fibers were significantly more hyperpolarized during superfusion with WB 4101 than with chloroethylclonidine. Triggered activity induced by delayed or early after depolarizations was not seen in any experiment. CONCLUSIONS. Automatic arrhythmias induced by alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation during simulated ischemia may be attributed to a specific alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype that is blocked by WB 4101. These results have important implications with respect to the induction of arrhythmias in the setting of ischemia and the means for their prevention or treatment. \nContinuous infusion 5-fluorouracil plus weekly cisplatin for pancreatic carcinoma. A Mid-Atlantic Oncology Program study. Fifty-six previously untreated patients with biopsy-proven, locally advanced or metastatic and measurable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with the combination of a protracted intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and low dose weekly bolus cisplatin administered continuously for 10 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period. The objective response rate was 16% with two patients (4%) achieving a complete response (confidence intervals, 8% to 29%). The median survival time for all treated patients was 5.8 months; however, 26% of all patients were alive at 1 year. Both median survival time and the proportion alive at 1 year exceed that of prior reports involving large patient groups, possibly due to better patient selection. \nMycotic aneurysm of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery in a case of infective endocarditis. Mycotic aneurysms of the celiac artery are extremely rare, and in our review of the literature we found that in only one case was it due to infective endocarditis. In our case a 19-year-old female patient with culture-negative infective endocarditis presented with pain in the epigastric area. A celiac artery aneurysm was diagnosed by ultrasonography and confirmed on CT scan and angiography, which also demonstrated an associated aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery. Since excellent collateral circulation was present, simple ligation of the two aneurysms was performed. The patient presented no major complications in the postoperative course. \nImpaired phonological reading in primary degenerative dementia. This case study reports the profile of preserved and impaired capacities in a left-handed patient suffering from primary degenerative dementia of unknown aetiology. She was remarkable because her relatively preserved object naming and semantic categorization abilities contrasted with severe deficits in speech fluency, oral reading, inability to execute spoken and written commands, and severely impaired auditory-verbal short-term memory. Her reading disorder could be characterized as a disturbance of assembled phonology. She had great difficulty reading pronounceable nonwords, but she could correctly read irregular words. She showed effects of word imageability or concreteness (more than word frequency). She also showed effects of part-of-speech, where nouns and adjectives were read more easily than inflected verbs. She had difficulty reading function words. The syntactic category effects could be proven (by hierarchical log-linear analysis) not to be an artefact of imageability differences between verbs, adjectives and nouns. In reading aloud she made visual and morphological errors, but no semantic errors. This interesting pattern of preserved semantic information and disrupted phonological processing is unusual in dementia and contrasts with the severe dysnomia of patients with surface dyslexia who are able to read by the indirect, assembly-of-phonology route and show better reading of nonwords than irregular words. Her reading by a direct visual-semantic route appeared to be associated with relatively intact object naming, concrete word reading, and irregular word reading. This selective impairment of phonological reading in the context of partly preserved semantic abilities was interpreted as confirmation of the dissociability of language functions in primary degenerative dementia. \nAcanthosis nigricans and a rectal carcinoid. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is often related to adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract, but it has also been found to coexist with tumors of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation system. It can precede, accompany, or follow the appearance of the underlying tumor. Evaluation of our patient's new-onset acanthosis nigricans led to the discovery of an asymptomatic rectal carcinoid tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first report of acanthosis nigricans associated with a carcinoid tumor of the rectum. It emphasizes the importance of considering underlying malignancy in the evaluation of patients with acanthosis nigricans. \nPiezoelectric lithotripsy for gallstones: analysis of results in patients with extended selection. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is successful in fragmenting gallstones, but less than 28 per cent of patients with gallstone disease fulfil the conventional criteria for treatment. However, no data exist to substantiate these selection criteria. In this study, the selection criteria were broadened to include patients with radiolucent stones of any size and number, and radio-opaque stones less than 3 cm in diameter. To date; 108 symptomatic patients with gallstones have received treatment. All patients received up to six outpatient sessions of ESWL (6000 shock waves per session) without sedation or analgesia. The dissolution therapy consisted of combined bile salt and terpene administration. The clearance rates were 9 per cent within 2 months, 21 per cent at 2-4 months, 38 per cent at 4-8 months, 60 per cent at 8-12 months, and 78 per cent at 12-18 months. Of patients with a successful outcome only 19 (18 per cent) would have satisfied traditional selection criteria. There have been no significant complications except in one patient who developed mild acute pancreatitis, which settled on conservative treatment, and two patients who developed acute cholecystitis. This study would suggest that the previously accepted selection criteria underestimate the number of patients suitable for gallstone ESWL and dissolution therapy. \nExpression of Her-2/neu oncogene protein product and epidermal growth factor receptors in surgical specimens of human breast cancers. Her-2/neu protein product was immunocytochemically analyzed in 139 breast cancers. Epidermal growth factor receptors were similarly analyzed in 74 breast cancers from the same patient pool. These results were also separated on the basis of estrogen receptor proteins and of combined aneuploidy with elevated S-phase from flow cytometry. Invasive breast cancer yielded a positive label for Her-2/neu protein (26%) and for epidermal growth factor receptor (25%), with no significant difference. Correlations with estrogen receptor labeling yielded differences significant inversely for both Her-2/neu protein (p less than 0.02) and epidermal growth factor receptor (p less than 0.01). Positive Her-2/neu protein labels correlated with a positive combination of aneuploidy and elevated S-phase (37%) and a negative combination of aneuploidy and elevated S-phase (21%), with a statistically nonsignificant difference. Positive epidermal growth factor receptor cases with aneuploidy and an elevated S-phase (75%) and without aneuploidy and elevated S-phase (42%) did differ with significance at p less than 0.05. There were eight cases positive for both Her-2/neu protein and epidermal growth factor receptor, four of six cases with negative estrogen receptor, four of six cases with negative estrogen receptor, six of six cases aneuploid, and five of six cases with an elevated S-phase. All eight cases had threatening disease--either stage III or stage IV, with one case of extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (comedo). Correlation of negative Her-2/neu protein with negative epidermal growth factor receptor was significant (p less than 0.05) in 74 cases. However, positive Her-2/neu protein did not correlate with positive epidermal growth factor receptor; there was a trend toward inverse correlation. We conclude that epidermal growth factor receptor labeling results show similarities to Her-2/neu protein results, but epidermal growth factor receptor tended to correlate with unfavorable ploidy and S-phase. Epidermal growth factor receptor labeling might be useful in breast cancers with macrocysts reported to show high epidermal growth factor activity. \nDelirium in an elderly woman possibly associated with administration of misoprostol. Misoprostol has been associated with adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal symptoms, gynecologic problems, and headache. Changes in mental status, however, have not been reported. We present a case in which an 89-year-old woman in a long-term care facility became confused after the initiation of misoprostol therapy. The patient's change in mental status was first reported nine days after the initiation of therapy. Her delirium significantly improved after misoprostol was discontinued and her mental status returned to normal within a week. Because no other factors related to this patient changed significantly, the delirium experienced by this patient possibly resulted from misoprostol therapy. \nRecurrence rates of treated basal cell carcinomas. Part 1: Overview. This is the first article in a series reviewing the extensive experience of the Oncology Section of the Skin and Cancer Unit, from 1955 through 1982, with 5755 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) treated by curettage-electrodesiccation, surgical excision, or x-ray therapy. Recurrence rates were calculated by three methods for each of the treatment modalities: 1) by the raw recurrence rate method; 2) by the \"strict\" 5-year recurrence rate method; and 3) by modification of the life-table method. Our analyses show that the last method best approximates the true recurrence rate. Primary (previously untreated) BCCs had a 5-year recurrence rate of 10.6% (standard error 0.6%), and previously treated BCCs had a rate of 15.4% (standard error 1.3%) (P = .0002). The greatest risk for recurrence of treated primary BCCs occurred 1 to 4 years after therapy. It is concluded that recurrence rates of primary BCCs should be reported separately from those of previously treated BCCs and that the modified life-table method is best suited to calculate 5-year recurrence rates. \nSpecific detection of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis by DNA hybridisation with a fragment of the insertion element IS900. This paper describes the evaluation of a newly developed DNA probe for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. DNA probe PCR278 is a 278 bp fragment obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 5'-region of IS900, an insertion element contained in the genome of M paratuberculosis. This DNA probe can specifically distinguish M paratuberculosis from a wide range of other organisms, including members of the M avium-M intracellulare complex. When used in conjunction with the PCR amplification technique DNA probe PCR278 could detect as little as 10 fg (equivalent to two genomes) starting material of M paratuberculosis genomic DNA. Use of PCR amplification assays based on IS900, for the detection of M paratuberculosis, and homologous IS elements found in disease isolates of M avium should greatly help our understanding of the role of these organisms in Crohn's disease and other chronic inflammatory disorders. \nAngiosarcoma at the site of a Dacron vascular prosthesis: a case report and literature review. Four of 32 reported sarcomas related to the aorta have arisen around previously placed aortic vascular prostheses suggesting that the graft may have been an etiologic factor. Our recent experience with such an angiosarcoma arising around a Dacron aortic graft prompted a review of the lesion to identify risk factors, diagnostic approaches, and treatment options. The diagnosis of these sarcomas is seldom made before operation. Animal studies have implicated plastic polymers including Dacron as carcinogenic materials capable of inducing sarcoma in 7% to 50% of exposures. Because of the rarity of these tumors and the thousands of vascular implants used over the past 30 years, it is unlikely that this degree of risk can be extrapolated to humans. However, a tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of any mass or thromboembolic event associated with a vascular prosthesis. \nThe use of bone allografts for limb salvage in high-grade extremity osteosarcoma. Limb preservation is increasingly being employed in the local treatment of high-grade extremity osteosarcoma. Bone allografts used to reconstruct the bony defects following tumor resection offer many advantages, including joint reconstruction and incorporation of the graft to the host bone in these relatively young patients. The results of 53 patients 30 years of age or younger were assessed to determine functional outcome. Fresh-frozen allografts were employed as osteoarticular grafts, allograft-arthrodeses, allograft-prosthesis composites, or intercalary grafts. Follow-up intervals averaged 25 months (range, two to 63 months). Life-table analysis showed that the probability of a satisfactory functional result was 73% if local tumor recurrences were excluded. Complications included 16 infections, six fractures, 12 nonunions, and six unstable joints. There were five local recurrences. Eighteen grafts ultimately failed, and in six patients, this resulted in an above-knee amputation. An additional five received a second graft. The functional \"end results\" of the 38 patients with two or more years of follow-up examinations were 70% satisfactory in those without a local recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference in functional outcome or local or distant relapse in those patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy. The authors conclude that allografts can be used for limb reconstruction in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma who receive aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy. The functional results are comparable to other methods of reconstruction, and once incorporated by the host, offer the advantage of longevity, compared with metallic implants. \nThoracic manifestations after esophageal variceal sclerotherapy. Endoscopic esophageal variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is often used in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to esophageal varices. We retrospectively reviewed the Mayo Clinic experience with EVS between 1980 and 1989 to determine the incidence of thoracic manifestations and chest roentgenographic abnormalities associated with this procedure. The study population consisted of 223 patients who underwent 390 EVS procedures. In all patients, chest roentgenography was done before and after EVS. Ethanolamine oleate or tetradecyl sulfate was used as the sclerosant. Fever, chest pain, and odynophagia were frequent findings after EVS and tended to be short-lived. Local complications at the site of injection, such as esophageal perforation (in 1% of EVS procedures) and abscess (in 0.3%), were infrequent but associated with substantial mortality. Esophageal stricture was noted as a late complication in less than 10% of patients, and clinically recognized aspiration pneumonitis was rare. Respiratory insufficiency developed after 14 EVS procedures. Chest roentgenographic abnormalities, which were commonly detected (after 85% of EVS procedures) but were rarely of clinical significance, included retrocardiac or mediastinal widening or densities (in 35%), pleural effusions (in 27%), atelectasis (in 12%), and pulmonary infiltrates (in 9%). Most thoracic manifestations after EVS are likely due to a local inflammatory response to the sclerosant. \nPrimary and metastatic breast carcinoma: initial clinical evaluation with PET with the radiolabeled glucose analogue 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. The authors assessed whether breast cancers can be detected by means of positron emission tomography (PET) with the positron-emitter-labeled glucose analogue 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). In 12 patients with primary and/or metastatic breast cancer, PET images of F-18 distribution in vivo were obtained approximately 1 hour after intravenous injection of 10 mCi of FDG. Scan findings were correlated with other imaging data and physical examination and biopsy results. Ten of 10 primary breast cancers were imaged by means of FDG PET with a tumor:background FDG uptake ratio of 8.1 (median). Ten of 10 bone metastases were imaged with a tumor:normal bone uptake ratio of 6.05 (median). Five of five known soft-tissue metastases and four previously unsuspected nodal lesions were found with PET. No false-positive foci of FDG uptake were demonstrated. In two cases with negative mammograms due to dense breast parenchyma, FDG PET clearly delineated the primary tumors. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility and substantial potential of PET scanning with FDG to detect and localize both primary and metastatic breast cancers. \nCell population depletion associated with fetal alcohol brain damage: mechanisms of BAC-dependent cell loss. Neuronal death is one of the most serious consequences of alcohol exposure during development. Studies described in this paper used a neonatal rat model to address factors affecting neuronal death following alcohol exposure during the period of rapid brain growth, and relate them to possible mechanisms of damage. The profile of blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) is an important variable influencing both brain growth deficits and neuronal death--a smaller daily dose of alcohol can be more damaging than a larger daily dose, if it is consumed in a binge-like pattern that produces relatively higher BACs. Alcohol exposure for a single day also can be damaging, producing both brain growth deficits and neuron loss, if high BACs are obtained. Various brain regions and different neuronal populations within a given brain area exhibit different degrees of vulnerability. Some neuronal loss clearly is a function of cell death due to direct effects of alcohol, while other deficits may be due to either primary or secondary effects of the alcohol insult. In the cerebellum, a maturational or metabolic factor also appears to be involved with alcohol-induced neuronal death. Immunocytochemical studies using a monoclonal antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) indicated that cerebellar lobules containing Purkinje cells that are in the process of extending dendrites are ones that are more vulnerable to alcohol than lobules containing Purkinje cells that mature later. Alcohol exposure during brain development may be producing neuron attrition in multiple ways, including disruption of membrane integrity, inhibition of protein synthesis or other alterations such as lipid solubility, or by disruption of cytoskeletal elements. \nCD63/Pltgp40: a platelet activation antigen identical to the stage-specific, melanoma-associated antigen ME491. CD63 is a 53-Kd lysosomal membrane glycoprotein that has been identified as a platelet activation molecule. The current study presents evidence that CD63 and Pltgp40, a platelet membrane glycoprotein identified in this laboratory, are the same molecule and that CD63/Pltgp40 is identical to the well-characterized, stage-specific melanoma-associated antigen ME491. Identity of CD63 and Pltgp40 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and sequential immunodepletion studies, which showed that the anti-Pltgp40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) H5C6 and an anti-CD63 MoAb CLB/Gran 12 recognized the same 40- to 55-Kd platelet glycoprotein. In addition, the anti-CD63 MoAb specifically recognized immunoaffinity-purified Pltgp40. Amino acid sequences obtained from NH2-terminal and tryptic fragment peptides of Pltgp40 were used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) probes using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. A 386-bp cDNA probe partially encoding CD63/Pltgp40 and a full length cDNA probe were 100% identical to the corresponding sequence of ME491. Antibodies H5C6 and CLB/Gran12 immunoprecipitated a 30- to 60-Kd heterodisperse glycoprotein from G361 melanoma cells, as had previously been reported for antibodies recognizing ME491. These data, taken together with the extensive homology recently reported between ME491, the Schistosoma mansoni membrane antigen SM23, CD37, the tumor-associated antigen CO-029, and the target of an antiproliferative antibody-1, suggest that CD63 is a member of a new family of related molecules. \nQuestionnaire versus clinical interview in the diagnosis of headache. A self-administered questionnaire based on the operational diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS) was evaluated in a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of headache disorders. A clinical interview was used as index of validity. Seven hundred and thirteen subjects were included. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and chance-corrected agreement rate for the diagnosis of migraine was 51%, 92%, 50% (PVpos), 93% (PVneg), and 0.43 respectively. Corresponding values for episodic tension-type headache were 43%, 96%, 95% (PVpos), 46% (PVneg), and 0.30; and for chronic tension-type headache 14%, 100%, 100% (PVpos), 97% (PVneg), and 0.24. It is concluded that a questionnaire is not a satisfactory tool in diagnosing headache disorders according to the IHS criteria. The methods of data collection seem to have significant influence on the results. Caution in handling data obtained by means of subjective statements is advocated. \nVascular infection: another hazard of listeriosis. Two case reports are presented of Listeria monocytogenes infection complicating vascular reconstructions. The importance of this problem lies in the resistance of the organism to some of the prophylactic antibiotics recommended for vascular surgery. Patients with prosthetic vascular grafts, particularly if immunocompromised, may be at risk from Listeria infection and may be advised to avoid potentially affected food. \nEnterobius egg granuloma of the vulva and peritoneum: review of the literature. Two cases of Enterobius granuloma containing eggs only are reported. The first case involved the vulva, where no such granuloma has been reported previously. The coexistence of peritoneal granuloma and rectal adenocarcinoma in the second case suggests the possibility of direct penetration of the damaged colonic wall by the parasite, as emphasized by several previous reports of neoplastic involvement and perforation of the intestinal wall in cases of ectopic infections. The diagnostic criteria of Enterobius eggs granuloma, which might be a diagnostic dilemma for pathologists who are not familiar with such criteria, are described herein. \nCardiac function in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: a study of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes are reported frequently after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance of ECG changes by echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function. Forty-five patients with intracranial aneurysms were studied. All patients had a 12-lead ECG and a two-dimensional echocardiogram. After patients with an history of chronic cardiac disease (n = 4) were excluded, only four patients were found to have wall motion abnormalities. These patients had only minor ECG abnormalities, but severe neurological dysfunction. Conversely, patients with other ECG abnormalities including the deep inverted T waves associated usually with SAH, had normal echocardiograms. We conclude that the ECG is not an accurate predictor of myocardial function after SAH and that myocardial dysfunction is related more closely to severity of neurological condition. \nThrombolytic therapy: then and now. Although thrombolytic agents were discovered nearly 60 years ago, it is only within the past decade that the clinical use of these agents has revolutionized the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. There are four currently available agents approved for use in treatment of myocardial infarction: streptokinase, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, and anistreplase. Although each of these agents works in a unique fashion, the common end point of therapy is the dissolution of a fibrin clot by the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. A number of clinically measurable end points have been used to determine the effectiveness of these agents in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, including mortality, reperfusion, patency, left ventricular function, left ventricular volumes, and quantitative creatine kinase isoenzyme analysis. Secondary end points have included bleeding and stroke, as well as recurrent ischemic events. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of all of these agents in achieving the desired end points and comparative studies, including several large-scale trials, have failed to differentiate among these agents with regard to efficacy. Newer dosing regimens for currently available thrombolytic agents, as well as new thrombolytic agents, are currently under active investigation and will be the subject of intense research over the next few years. Despite the lack of consensus as to which agent is superior, it is clear that thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction is the treatment of choice. \nCytomegalovirus infection causes delayed platelet recovery after bone marrow transplantation. The pathogenic effect of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on the hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was retrospectively studied in 87 recipients of (nonpurged) autologous BMT and in 56 recipients of allogeneic BMT from HLA-identical siblings. Indications for autologous BMT were lymphomas or acute leukemias and for allogeneic BMT various malignancies or aplastic anemia. Patients were divided for the study in two groups, CMV-positive and CMV-negative on the basis of the CMV status pretransplant, and CMV-negative patients were kept CMV-negative by the local transfusion policy. In allogeneic BMT recipients, platelet recovery was significantly slower in CMV-positive patients than in CMV-negative patients (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 41 days v 27 days, P = .007). This difference held true when patients with acute graft-versus-host disease above grade I were excluded (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 42 days v 24 days, P = .01). In autologous BMT, the negative effect on platelet recovery was present in patients with lymphomas, but absent in patients with acute leukemias. Patients with acute leukemias had a very delayed recovery of platelets and granulocytes after autologous BMT, irrespective of the CMV status, probably due to the original stem cell disorder. Platelet recovery was significantly slower in CMV-positive autologous BMT recipients with lymphomas than in those not infected (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 36 days v 24 days, P = .0002). The presence of CMV infection had no effect on the recovery of granulocytes in autologous or allogeneic BMT. These data show that CMV infection causes delayed platelet recovery after BMT; however, in autologous BMT, the underlying disease (ie, acute leukemia) is more determinant for hematopoiesis after BMT. \nDiagnostic tests for choreoacanthocytosis. Two patients with striatal atrophy and a clinical syndrome consistent with choreoacanthocytosis had normal dried blood smears but their red cells demonstrated an abnormal sensitivity to various conditions known to promote discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Dilution in normal saline, in vitro aging, and contact with glass caused a great proportion of these patients' red cells to develop multiple spiny or rounded projections. Under identical conditions, such shape changes did not occur in normal patients or in those with Huntington's disease. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the age-induced increase in acanthocytic-appearing cells could be reversed with chlorpromazine. These data suggest that the red cells from these patients with striatal degeneration are deficient in their ability to preserve normal shape in the face of echinocytic stress and that this observation has diagnostic and, possibly, pathophysiologic significance. \nUlnar tunnel syndrome. The ulnar tunnel syndrome is a relatively uncommon condition resulting from compression of the ulnar nerve as it passes through the loge de Guyon, or ulnar tunnel, in the wrist. The syndrome may cause weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles and loss of sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution of the hand. The most common cause of ulnar tunnel syndrome is chronic occupational trauma, either from pressure exerted over the hypothenar eminence by a tool or from the use of the heel of the hand as a hammer. Nonoccupational etiologies include congenital, inflammatory, neoplastic, vascular, metabolic, degenerative and traumatic disorders. Diagnosis often requires neurophysiologic evaluation, in addition to a careful history and physical examination. Conservative treatment aimed at protecting the ulnar tunnel from trauma frequently is effective. Occasionally, surgical decompression of the ulnar tunnel is required. \nAcute catastrophic complications of balloon aortic valvuloplasty. The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators. Among the initial 492 patients who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty as part of the Mansfield Investigational Device Exemption Protocol, 31 (6.3%) had acute catastrophic complications. These included ventricular perforation in nine (1.8%), seven women and two men; six cases (67%) involved serial balloon inflations and seven (78%) also involved dual balloon inflations. In six (67%) of the nine patients perforation was fatal. In four patients studied at necropsy, the perforation involved the base of the lateral left ventricular free wall. Pericardiocentesis was performed in five patients, three of whom survived with (one patient) or without (two patients) operative repair. Acute, severe aortic regurgitation developed in four patients (0.8%), all women. None had significant regurgitation before valvuloplasty; dual balloons were used in two of the four. All three patients who underwent emergency valve replacement survived. A fourth patient died 2 days after valvuloplasty without operative intervention. Fatal cardiac arrest complicated balloon aortic valvuloplasty in 13 patients (2.6%), including 7 with cardiogenic shock and 4 with refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Of the seven with shock, four had been treated with serial balloon inflations; dual balloons were used in three. In two of three patients studied at necropsy, the aortic valve was observed to be congenitally bicuspid. A fatal cerebrovascular accident occurred in two patients (0.4%); it was hemorrhagic in one, embolic in another. Both patients were treated with serial (including one dual) balloon inflations. Limb amputation was required in three patients (0.6%), two women and one man; in two patients amputation was above the knee, in the third patient it was limited to two toes. \nEndocrine and immunohistochemical studies on thyrotropin (TSH)-secreting pituitary adenomas: responses of TSH, alpha-subunit, and growth hormone to hypothalamic releasing hormones and their distribution in adenoma cells. Endocrine and immunohistochemical studies were performed in two cases of TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas. The patients had elevated serum TSH and alpha-subunit concentrations despite high serum thyroid hormone levels. In addition, one patient (no. 1) had elevated serum GH levels with clinical evidence of acromegaly. GH-releasing hormone infusion increased serum levels of TSH, alpha-subunit and GH in the two patients. TRH injection increased serum TSH levels in both patients and, concomitantly, serum alpha-subunit and GH levels in patient 1. Basal TSH levels and their responses to TRH changed reciprocally to changes in serum thyroid hormone levels, although TRH-induced GH release did not. The administration of GnRH also increased serum TSH, alpha-subunit, and GH levels in patient 1. In accordance with these in vivo results, pituitary adenoma cells in culture obtained from patient 1 responded to GH-releasing hormone, TRH, or GnRH to secrete TSH, alpha-subunit, and GH. Incubation of cells with dexamethasone resulted in inhibition of TSH and stimulation of GH secretion without a significant change in alpha-subunit secretion. On the basis of light microscopic and electron microscopic double gold immunohistochemistry, the tumor from patient 1 was a bimorphous adenoma composed of two separate cell types: cells with TSH beta-subunit (TSH beta) and alpha-subunit, and those with GH and alpha-subunit. The remainder consisted mainly of cells with TSH beta and alpha-subunit. The coproduction of the unusual combination of two hormones such as GH and alpha-subunit in a single-type of adenoma cell and the coexistence of thyrotrophs and somatotrophs in one pituitary adenoma along with the aberrant responses of TSH beta, alpha-subunit, and GH to multiple hypothalamic hormones suggest the dedifferentiation of pituitary cells to multipotential progenitor cells by neoplastic transformation. \nLong-term roentgenographic and functional changes in patients who were treated with wide fenestration for central lumbar stenosis. Thirty-four patients who had central stenosis of the lumbar spine were treated with wide fenestration, a procedure in which only the medial parts of the inferior facets and the adjoining ligamentum flavum were removed. The patients were followed for an average of five and one-half years (range, four and one-half years to seven years and ten months). Wide fenestration successfully relieved the symptoms. The new bone that was laid down in the operatively treated segments did not reproduce the symptoms of spinal stenosis; instead, it appeared to stabilize those segments. \nTemporal thresholds for neocortical infarction in rats subjected to reversible focal cerebral ischemia. We investigated the temporal threshold for focal cerebral infarction in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. The right middle cerebral artery and common carotid artery were occluded for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 24 hours, and all the animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the onset of ischemia. Cortical infarct volumes and edema volumes were quantified in serial frozen sections of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue using image analysis. Upon occlusion, blood flow in the core of the ischemic zone, measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry, fell to a mean +/- standard deviation of 21 +/- 7% of the preocclusion baseline value (n = 26). During the first hour of ischemia, blood flow in the densely ischemic zone rose to 27 +/- 8% of baseline (n = 25). Release of the middle cerebral artery and common carotid artery occlusions rapidly restored cortical blood flow to 213 +/- 83% of baseline (n = 21). Focal ischemia of 1 hour's duration caused little or no infarction, while ischemic intervals of 2 and 3 hours produced successively larger volumes of infarcted cortex. Ischemic intervals of 3-4 hours' duration followed by approximately 20 hours of recirculation yielded infarct volumes that were not significantly different from those after 24 hours of permanent focal ischemia. The results indicate that 3-4 hours of focal cerebral ischemia in this rat model is sufficient to attain maximal infarction and suggest that recirculation or pharmacological interventions after this time will provide little benefit. \nLong-term follow-up after partial removal of a solitary kidney BACKGROUND. The removal of more than one kidney in animals leads to proteinuria and progressive renal failure due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This injury may be the result of chronic glomerular hyperfiltration. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a reduction in renal mass of more than 50 percent on residual renal function and morphology in humans. METHODS. We evaluated long-term renal function in 14 patients with a solitary kidney who had undergone partial nephrectomy for renal-cell or transitional-cell carcinoma. In 12, the first kidney had been removed 2 months to 21 years previously for the same type of cancer; in 2, the other kidney was congenitally atrophic. Before surgery, no patient had clinical or histopathological evidence of primary renal disease. All 14 patients underwent partial nephrectomy to remove a localized tumor, with 25 to 75 percent of the solitary kidney being excised. They were evaluated 5 to 17 years after surgery (mean, 7.7). RESULTS. Twelve patients had stable postoperative renal function, and end-stage renal failure developed in two. There were no changes in blood pressure in any patient during follow-up. Nine patients had proteinuria, which was mild (0.15 to 0.8 g of urinary protein per day) in five. The extent of proteinuria was inversely correlated with the amount of remaining renal tissue (P = 0.0065) and directly correlated with the duration of follow-up (P = 0.0005). Four patients with moderate-to-severe proteinuria had renal biopsies, which revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in three patients and global glomerulosclerosis in one. CONCLUSIONS. Long-term renal function remains stable in most patients with a reduction in renal mass of more than 50 percent. These patients are, however, at increased risk for proteinuria, glomerulopathy, and progressive renal failure. \nComparison of speed of onset of analgesic effect of diamorphine and morphine. In a random, double-blind crossover trial using an ischaemic limb pain model we have assessed the speed of onset of analgesia after an i.v. bolus of equipotent doses of diamorphine and morphine in 12 healthy male volunteers. Pain and its subsequent relief were assessed by means of a visual analogue scale. Two of the subjects found diamorphine acted quicker than morphine, one found no difference and nine found that morphine was quicker than diamorphine. The mean time to diamorphine effect was 53% greater than for morphine (P less than 0.005, Wilcoxon rank sum test). These findings suggest that, for rapid relief of pain, morphine is more suitable than diamorphine. \nManagement of malignant air leak in a child with a neonatal high-frequency oscillatory ventilator. A 10-year-old, 36-kg child with a malignant air leak who failed conventional mechanical ventilation and high-frequency jet ventilation was successfully treated with a neonatal high-frequency oscillatory ventilator for 31 days. Since the air leak resolved with minimal hemodynamic compromise, this technique may have application in the management of respiratory failure and air leak in the older and larger child for prolonged periods of time. \nContinuous intratumoral infusion of methotrexate for recurrent glioblastoma: a pilot study. Five patients with documented recurrences of glioblastoma multiforme were given continuous infusions of methotrexate delivered intratumorally using implantable catheters and subcutaneous refillable pumps. A continuous infusion of methotrexate (1 mg/d) was begun with concomitant oral administration of folinic acid. The methotrexate dose was increased every 2 weeks to 3, 10, 30, and, ultimately, 75 mg/d in two patients. Samples of serum and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained to determine the levels of methotrexate and total bioactive folates, and brain tissue was obtained from two patients for determination of methotrexate concentration. The patients survived from 7 to 49 weeks after the implantation of the infusion device. Neither the clinical examination nor sequential radiological studies gave clear evidence of reduction in tumor size. Pneumonia developed in one patient, and mild hepatitis and increased seizure frequency in another. Methotrexate was stable in the delivery system over 12 days, and ventricular CSF reached steady-state levels by 5 days. Steady-state ventricular CSF levels of methotrexate were higher than serum levels in some patients, while the reverse was true in others. Levels of total bioactive folates in the CSF did not increase above the normal range. Methotrexate concentrations were highest at the center of the tumor, but measurable amounts of methotrexate were detectable in all areas of the brain. At autopsy in four patients, variable liquefactive necrosis of the brain tumors was seen, and viable tumor was found at the periphery of the tumor bed. These preliminary results suggest that it is technically feasible to infuse methotrexate into brain tumor cavities, and show that little central nervous system or systemic toxicity was encountered in five patients. Better delineation of the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic approach will require further clinical trials. \nBenign spinal nerve sheath tumors: their occurrence sporadically and in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. Benign spinal nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas and schwannomas) often occur on dorsal nerve roots sporadically or in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. These are histologically benign tumors, and distinction between them is frequently not made by clinicians. To determine if there is a correlation between the histological pattern of benign spinal nerve sheath tumors and the type of neurofibromatosis, the clinical and pathological features of these tumors (86 surgical specimens and five autopsies) in 68 patients were reviewed. The patients were classified into one of four categories: neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, uncertain, or sporadic. The diagnostic criteria used for neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 were established by the National Institutes of Health. Patients who did not fulfill criteria for either neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2 but who had multiple nervous system tumors or other stigmata of neurofibromatosis were designated \"uncertain.\" Spinal nerve sheath tumors were considered sporadic in 42 cases (40 schwannomas and two neurofibromas). In the 14 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, all spinal nerve sheath tumors were neurofibromas. In six of the seven patients with neurofibromatosis type 2, all spinal nerve sheath tumors were schwannomas. One patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 had a spinal nerve sheath schwannoma and a tumor with features of both tumor types. The authors conclude that spinal nerve sheath tumors in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 are neurofibromas. In contrast, spinal nerve sheath tumors occurring in neurofibromatosis type 2 or sporadically are most frequently schwannomas. The distinct histological features of these tumors may reflect different pathogenetic mechanisms even though they arise at identical sites in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. \nDemonstration of myocardial reperfusion injury in humans: results of a pilot study utilizing acute coronary angioplasty with perfluorochemical in anterior myocardial infarction. Reperfusion may limit the amount of potentially salvageable myocardium through the introduction of cellular elements into previously ischemic but viable myocardium (reperfusion injury). It has been demonstrated that intracoronary infusion of a 20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion (Fluosol) significantly reduces infarct size and results in improved left ventricular function in the canine model. This pilot study was performed to explore the existence of myocardial reperfusion injury in humans. Utilizing Fluosol as a probe in conjunction with emergency coronary angioplasty, 26 patients presenting within 4 h with a first anterior myocardial infarction were randomized to emergency angioplasty or angioplasty followed by a 30-min intracoronary infusion of Fluosol at 40 ml/min. Global and regional ventricular function were assessed immediately and a mean of 12 days after successful angioplasty with contrast ventriculography. Infarct size was semiquantitated with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images before discharge. Twelve patients (six undergoing angioplasty alone, six treated with angioplasty and Fluosol) had an occluded infarct-related vessel (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 0 to 1) at the time of emergency catheterization and were included in the final analysis. At 12 days after successful angioplasty, the improvement in regional ventricular function was greater in patients receiving adjunctive therapy with intracoronary Fluosol versus those undergoing angioplasty alone utilizing both the radial shortening and centerline method, respectively (23 +/- 3.1% vs. 8 +/- 2.3%, p less than 0.02; and -1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. -2.9 +/- 0.2 SD/chord, p less than 0.05). \nThe effect of diazepam enema on the rectal mucosa of rats. The use of undiluted intravenous diazepam solution administered as an enema has been recommended for the acute management of seizures when intravenous access cannot be obtained. It is well absorbed, rapidly effective, and generally accepted as being safe when used in this manner. The effect of intravenous diazepam solution on the rectal mucosa has not been studied. This study demonstrates that there are no acute changes in the rectal mucosa of adult rats after administration of 10 to 20 times the recommended human dose. \nComputerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging following cranial base surgery. The computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging films of 57 patients who underwent anterior or anterolateral cranial base surgery from January 1987 to August 1989 were retrospectively reviewed to ascertain the significance of early and late postoperative intracranial imaging changes. Extra-axial changes (air, blood, cerebrospinal fluid collection) were found in 96% of patients; axial changes (brain edema, contusion) were seen in 30% of patients in the first postoperative period (72 hours). Subsequently, extra-axial changes began to resolve but axial changes became more prevalent. After 6 months, only axial changes persisted (encephalomalacia). It was encouraging to find a low correlation of imaging abnormalities with clinically significant findings. \nCircadian variation of transient myocardial ischemia in the early out-of-hospital period after first acute myocardial infarction. Circadian rhythms have been demonstrated in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and in other clinical cardiac dysfunctions. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether a circadian pattern of transient myocardial ischemia exists after first AMI. Prospectively, 24-hour ambulatory ST-segment monitoring was initiated at discharge on day 11 +/- 5 in 123 consecutive survivors of first AMI. A total of 93 ischemic episodes (91 asymptomatic) occurred in 21 of the 123 patients (17%) (mean duration of 30 minutes, range 4 to 292). A significant circadian rhythm of transient myocardial ischemia was found with a peak activity occurring in the evening hours (p less than 0.01). Thus, 43% of ischemic episodes and 42% of ischemic time occurred between 6 P.M. and 12 midnight. The characteristics of morning and evening episodes were similar, except for the heart rate at maximal ST-segment depression, which was significantly higher during morning episodes (p less than 0.02). Patients with transient myocardial ischemia had a diurnal distribution similar to the circadian variation displayed during ischemic activity. Thus, 16 of the 21 patients had ischemic episodes from 6 P.M. to 12 midnight versus 10 patients from 6 A.M. to 12 noon (p less than 0.01). The 24-hour mean minimal heart rate was significantly higher in patients with than without ischemic episodes (p less than 0.02). In conclusion, this study has established a significant circadian peak of transient myocardial ischemia in the evening hours in survivors of first AMI. Whether the pattern displayed is due to endogenous biologic functions or cyclic variations, or both, in the external environment needs to be clarified. \nNd:YAG iliac and femoropopliteal laser angioplasty: results with large probes as \"sole therapy\". Laser assisted balloon angioplasty with a laser heated metallic capped fiberoptic catheter may be effective in the treatment of femoral and iliac artery occlusive disease. In order to avoid the inherent trauma of balloon angioplasty, yet at the same time \"debulk\" atheroma, 75 patients underwent laser angioplasty of the superficial femoral and iliac arteries as \"sole therapy\". Laser angioplasty was performed using an Nd:YAG laser coupled to a 600 micron fiber and a 3.5 mm probe (22-28 watts), 4.2 mm or 5.0 probe (32-40 watts). Fifty-nine patients had laser angioplasty for claudication and 16 for limb salvage. The initial angiographic success rate was 84% (41/49) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the superficial femoral and 69% (18/26) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the iliac arteries. In follow-up extending to 21 months (mean 14.4 months) 73% (30/41) of the superficial femoral artery and 76% (14/18) of the initially recanalized iliac arteries remain patent. When initial failures are included, this represents an overall intermediate-term patency rate of 52% (32/49) for superficial femoral and 49% (14/26) for iliac arteries respectively. By avoiding the disruptive effect on the arterial wall architecture caused by balloon angioplasty, while at the same time ablating and vaporizing more atheromatous material with larger laser probes, the long-term patency rates of laser angioplasty as \"sole therapy\" may prove to be superior to those of laser assisted balloon angioplasty. \nTraumatic anterior fossa cerebrospinal fluid fistulae and craniofacial considerations. Traumatic cerebrospinal fluid fistulae may present a diagnostic and treatment challenge to the head and neck surgeon. The clinical presentation may be obscured by associated injuries. This article serves as a guide in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of patients with dural fistulae of the anterior cranial fossa. \nLeft ventricular thrombus in anterior acute myocardial infarction after thrombolysis. A GISSI-2 connected study. BACKGROUND. Streptokinase reduces the incidence of left ventricular thrombosis after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is unknown whether a similar effect can be obtained with different thrombolytic agents and whether subcutaneous calcium heparin can have an additional efficacy. METHODS AND RESULTS. To compare the effects of two different thrombolytic agents combined or not with heparin on the incidence and features of left ventricular thrombi and their related embolic events, we performed a GISSI-2 ancillary echocardiographic study (the first echocardiogram obtained within 48 hours of symptoms onset and the second before hospital discharge) that enrolled 180 consecutive patients (mean age, 63 +/- 11 years, 142 men) with a first anterior acute myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized into four groups of treatment: recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (n = 47), rt-PA plus heparin (n = 45), streptokinase (n = 39), and streptokinase plus heparin (n = 49). Left ventricular thrombosis was observed in 51 of 180 patients (28%). No significant differences were found concerning the incidence of thrombi in the four treatment groups. Mural shape of left ventricular thrombi was found more frequently than the protruding shape (71% versus 29% at the first examination, 64% versus 36% at the second), particularly in heparin-treated patients (93% versus 7% at first examination, 70% versus 30% at the second). Only one embolic event (0.5%) occurred during the hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that 1) the rate of left ventricular thrombi does not differ in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated either with streptokinase or rt-PA, 2) subcutaneous heparin, when begun 12 hours after intravenous thrombolysis, does not appear to further reduce the occurrence of thrombi but seems to influence the shape of left ventricular thrombi, and 3) during the predischarge period, embolic events are rare in patients treated by thrombolysis. \nEnhanced interstitial fluid adenosine attenuates myocardial stunning. Reversible myocardial dysfunction associated with transient ischemia has been termed the stunned myocardium. Because exogenous adenosine has been shown to protect the ischemic myocardium, we hypothesized that augmentation of endogenous adenosine levels would attenuate myocardial stunning. To induce stunning, anesthetized dogs were subjected to 15 minutes of ischemia (left anterior descending artery occlusion) followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA; 5 mg/kg/hr), an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, was used to augment adenosine levels. The effect of EHNA on interstitial fluid (ISF) adenosine levels, coronary blood flow, and regional systolic wall thickening was compared with that of an untreated group (n = 8). EHNA increased preischemia ISF adenosine levels threefold and was associated with a corresponding increase in coronary blood flow. EHNA administration did not alter preischemia systolic wall thickening. Although ISF adenosine increased fourfold during ischemia in the untreated group, ISF adenosine increased nearly sixtyfold above preischemia values in the EHNA-treated group and remained elevated throughout reperfusion. Postischemic regional function was enhanced significantly in the group treated with EHNA. These data show that adenosine deaminase inhibition increased ISF adenosine levels and attenuated myocardial stunning. Metabolic manipulation of myocardial ISF nucleoside levels may be beneficial in limiting postischemic myocardial dysfunction. \nMisdiagnosed papillary renal adenocarcinoma. We present 3 patients with papillary renal adenocarcinoma who were initially misdiagnosed owing to unusual clinical presentation. We suggest that if these presentations are borne in mind, pre-operative detection of this uncommon condition should be possible more often than is now the case. \nE1A oncogene induction of cytolytic susceptibility eliminates sarcoma cell tumorigenicity. The manner in which oncogenes influence tumorigenicity beyond their ability to immortalize cells is uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that, in addition to subverting cellular growth controls, oncogenes can actively determine tumor-inducing capacity by affecting neoplastic cell susceptibility to destruction by the host cellular immune response. The adenovirus type 5 E1A oncogene, which induces susceptibility to lysis by natural killer cells and encodes epitopes recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, was transfected into highly tumorigenic sarcoma cells. E1A expression in these sarcoma cells eliminated their tumorigenicity in recipients with natural killer cell activity that was competent to lyse these E1A-positive targets. Thymus-dependent responses were not required for tumor rejection. These results indicate that oncogene-regulated cellular pathways that affect neoplastic cell susceptibility to natural killer cell lytic mechanisms may influence tumor development in the immunocompetent host. \nAntiperistaltic and isoperistaltic intussusception associated with abnormal motility after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a case report. Antiperistaltic and recurrent intussusceptions are extremely rare in the adult. We report a patient with both. The patient developed an antiperistaltic intussusception distal to her Roux enteroenterostomy years after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity. The diagnosis was made preoperatively with gastrointestinal contrast radiography and ultrasonography. At surgery, the intussusception was reduced, and 12 inches of nonviable bowel was resected, with a functional end-to-end anastomosis. An isoperistaltic intussusception occurred in the early postoperative period just distal to the anastomosis. Manometric evaluation of the Roux limb after the second operation showed altered gastrointestinal motility, consisting of orad-propagated and aboard-propagated migrating motor complexes, minimal phase 2 activity, and lack of conversion to the fed pattern with a liquid meal. Although manometry was not performed before the development of the intussusception, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that altered intestinal motility may contribute to the development of intussusception. \nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left coronary artery in patients with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery: clinical and functional results. The safety and therapeutic benefits of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery, the left circumflex coronary artery or both were assessed in 61 patients with chronic (greater than 3 months) occlusion of the right coronary artery. Recanalization of the right coronary artery was not performed before dilatation of left coronary artery lesions. All lesions could be dilated without an acute ischemic event in the catheterization laboratory. However, three patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery within the first 8 days after coronary angioplasty. There were no in-hospital deaths. Of the remaining 58 patients, 51 (88%) had repeat angiography at a mean of 5.2 +/- 2.5 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (n = 17) or absence (n = 34) of restenosis defined as greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis at the dilated site. Baseline characteristics were comparable. The mean value for angina functional class at follow-up was significantly better in the group without than in the group with restenosis (0.4 +/- 0.6 vs 2.1 +/- 1.1, respectively; p less than 0.001). Sixty-five percent of the patients without restenosis were asymptomatic at follow-up. Seventy-five percent of the predicted maximal physical capacity was reached by 76% of the patients without restenosis compared with 33% in the group with restenosis (p less than 0.05). \nChronic xerostomia increases esophageal acid exposure and is associated with esophageal injury. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of chronic xerostomia on parameters of gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis. DESIGN: Observational study of a cohort of male patients with xerostomia and age-matched control subjects. SETTING: Tertiary-care Veterans Affairs Medical Center. SUBJECTS: Sixteen male patients with chronic xerostomia secondary to radiation for head and neck cancers or medications. Nineteen age-matched male control subjects with comparable alcohol and smoking histories. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Esophageal motility was similar in patients with xerostomia and controls. Clearance of acid from the esophagus and 24-hour intraesophageal pH were markedly abnormal in patients with xerostomia. Symptoms and signs of esophagitis were significantly more frequent in subjects with xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic xerostomia may predispose to esophageal injury, at least in part, by decreasing the clearance of acid from the esophagus and altering 24-hour intraesophageal pH. Esophageal injury is a previously unreported complication of long-term salivary deficiency. \nEcho/Doppler and hemodynamic correlates of vasodilator responsiveness in primary pulmonary hypertension. To determine correlates of acute vasodilator responsiveness in primary pulmonary hypertension, we retrospectively studied 25 patients, comparing 41 resting echo/Doppler and nine resting catheterization variables with the maximal reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance achieved during vasodilator trials. Twelve vasodilators were tested (mean, 5.6 drugs per patient; range, three to eight). Eight patients were vasodilator responsive, as defined by a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance greater than or equal to 30 percent in response to at least one agent. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed only Doppler pulmonic peak flow velocity to be an independent correlate of responsiveness (p less than 0.05). Responders differed from nonresponders in having a higher Doppler pulmonic peak flow velocity (PV) (SD 81 +/- 24 vs 64 +/- 15 cm/s; p = 0.05), lower mean right atrial pressure (RAP) (6 +/- 4 vs 13 +/- 7 mm Hg; p = 0.04), and longer median survival (37 vs 5 months; p = 0.03). Seven of eight responders had RAP less than or equal to 10 mm Hg, and all responders had PV greater than 60 cm/s. Seven of ten patients with both RAP less than or equal to 10 and PV greater than 60 and one of the 15 remaining patients were vasodilator responsive (p less than 0.001). Thus, echo/Doppler and invasive hemodynamic parameters correlate with acute vasodilator responsiveness in primary pulmonary hypertension. Patients with low PV and high RAP values were almost never vasodilator responsive. Doppler pulmonic peak velocity and mean RAP may be useful in identifying patients most likely to respond to acute vasodilator trials and those in whom testing is unlikely to yield positive results. \nTransesophageal echocardiography in renal cell carcinoma: an accurate diagnostic technique for intracaval neoplastic extension. Between 4 and 10% of patients with renal cell carcinoma have tumor involving the inferior vena cava and many of these patients have suprahepatic extension. In patients with intracaval neoplastic extension precise definition of the superior aspect of the tumor thrombus is critical. Transabdominal ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and inferior venacavography are all currently used to evaluate the inferior vena cava in these patients. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was used to image the inferior vena cava in 5 patients with renal cell carcinoma and intracaval neoplastic extension. In each patient transesophageal echocardiography correctly revealed the superior extent of tumor thrombus. In 3 patients tumor thrombus was found at a higher level by transesophageal echocardiography than by CT, MRI and inferior venacavography. In all patients tumor imaging by transesophageal echocardiography correlated well with the gross appearance and extent of tumor found at operation. Echocardiography also documented the absence of residual gross tumor after resection. Transesophageal echocardiography was also useful to assess left ventricular function. Although each of these patients had a pulmonary artery catheter as well transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in situations when right atrial tumor thrombus prevents right heart catheterization. This small series demonstrates that intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography can accurately evaluate the extent of tumor thrombus and provides a means to assess myocardial function complementary to the pulmonary artery catheter. \nA randomized clinical trial of feeder vessel photocoagulation of sickle cell retinopathy. A long-term follow-up. Long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in a randomized prospective trial of feeder vessel photocoagulation for proliferative sickle retinopathy has been completed. Of the 44 patients enrolled in Chicago, nearly a decade follow-up has been achieved on 29 patients (45 eyes). There were 20 control untreated eyes and 25 argon laser-treated eyes. Prolonged loss of visual acuity was rare in both groups. Argon laser photocoagulation has had a sustained effect on reducing the incidence of vitreous hemorrhage and visual loss from vitreous hemorrhage. Nine (45%) of 20 control eyes had vitreous hemorrhage, and it was recurrent in six (66%) of these nine eyes. A single episode was the only hemorrhagic event in the treated eyes. The laser-induced complications of choroidal neovascularization or retinal detachment were not associated with long-term visual sequelae. New sea fan evolution in 47% of study eyes suggests that these patients require long-term surveillance. \nLeft ventricular function changes after cardiomyoplasty in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty has been reported in the treatment of severe myocardial failure. In this investigation significant improvement of left ventricular function with dynamic cardiomyoplasty was demonstrated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or Chagas' disease for more than 1 year of follow-up. Thirteen patients with advanced heart failure who were in New York Heart Association class III or IV were operated on. There were no operative deaths. Patients were followed up for a mean of 11.5 months, and two patients died during the late follow-up period. Five of nine patients observed long term are in New York Heart Association class I, three in class II, and one in class III. At 3 months of follow-up, Doppler echocardiography demonstrated that left ventricular segmental wall shortening increased from 11.4% +/- 2.3% to 16.4% +/- 3.9% (p less than 0.01), and left ventricular stroke volume from 23.9 +/- 5.7 to 34.4 +/- 10 ml (p less than 0.01). Radioisotopic left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 20.9% +/- 3.3% to 25.4% +/- 7.7% (p = 0.06), and its better increases occurred in patients with lesser left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions. Cardiac catheterization showed that left ventricular stroke work index increased from 14.6 +/- 3.8 to 23.7 +/- 6.7 gm.m/m2 (p less than 0.01), whereas pulmonary wedge pressure decreased from 24.8 +/- 3.7 to 17.2 +/- 5.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). At 6 and 12 months of follow-up, all the preceding values remained essentially unchanged. Thus cardiomyoplasty improves left ventricular function and may halt the steady evolution of severe cardiomyopathies. \nRetinal manifestations of neurofibromatosis. Diagnosis and management. Five patients presented with vision-threatening retinal tumors and systemic signs of neurofibromatosis, including neurofibromatosis type 1 (four patients) and familial cafe-au-lait spots (one patient). These tumors included large retinal astrocytic hamartomas, multiple retinal capillary hemangiomas, and combined hamartomas of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium, which resulted in rubeotic glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment. Surgical therapy included retinal cryopexy, xenon and argon photocoagulation, scleral buckling, and pars plana vitrectomy with excisional retinal biopsy. Retinal tumors may result in marked visual loss in patients with neurofibromatosis, and vitreoretinal surgery may restore useful vision in some of these patients. \nA randomized controlled trial of the effects of three antihypertensive agents on blood pressure control and quality of life in older women. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial to compare the impact of titrated doses of atenolol (50 to 100 mg once a day), enalapril (5 to 20 mg once a day), and diltiazem (sustained release) (60 to 180 mg twice a day) on blood pressure and quality of life in older hypertensive women. Two hundred forty-two patients were randomized. Dose titration was completed by week 4 after randomization, and the maintenance phase was completed at week 16. Diltiazem (sustained release) demonstrated greater diastolic blood pressure lowering at both weeks 8 and 16 by an intent-to-treat analysis. At week 16, diltiazem changed diastolic blood pressure -13.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg compared with -10.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg for atenolol, and -10.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg for enalapril. Diltiazem also demonstrated greater lowering of systolic blood pressure at week 3, but these differences in systolic blood pressure had decreased by week 16. More patients were classified as treatment failures during the 16 weeks of the trial for atenolol (15%) than for diltiazem (2.5%), while the treatment failure rate was intermediate with enalapril (8%). Total rates of adverse events were equivalent across the three treatment arms. There were few significant differences in the impact of the three treatments on mean scores of quality-of-life measures at week 16. There was a trend for atenolol to have somewhat worse quality-of-life scores, but none of these differences were statistically significant. In conclusion, all three treatment regimens were effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure without significant differences in rates of adverse events or deleterious effects on quality of life. \nRadiation-induced meningiomas: experience at the Mount Sinai Hospital and review of the literature. From the records of The Mount Sinai Hospital, seven cases which met established criteria for radiation-induced meningiomas were identified. This represents the largest series of radiogenic meningiomas documented in North America and includes both intracranial and intraspinal tumors. The records and pathological specimens were reviewed and these data analyzed with other cases retrieved from the world literature. This study reveals that radiation-induced meningiomas can be categorized into three groups based on the amount of radiation administered: 1) low dose; 2) moderate dose and miscellaneous; and 3) high dose. The overwhelming majority of cases had received low-dose irradiation (800 rad) to the scalp for tinea capitis and the second largest group resulted from high-dose irradiation for primary brain tumors (greater than 2000 rad). The unique features distinguishing radiation-induced meningiomas from other meningiomas are reviewed. Although histologically atypical tumors were common in this series, overt malignancy was not encountered. The preoperative management of these lesions should include angiography to evaluate for large-vessel occlusive vasculopathy, a known association of meningiomas induced by high-dose irradiation. Given the propensity these tumors possess for recurrence, a wide bony and dural margin is recommended at surgical resection. \nAnti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in ulcerative colitis. Comparison with other colitides/diarrheal illnesses. Previous studies from this laboratory showed that serum anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, distinct from those associated with active Wegener's granulomatosis, are present in the majority of patients with ulcerative colitis. In this study, the specificity of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies for ulcerative colitis as compared with other colitides and diarrheal illness was determined. In a blinded study, test samples of serum were screened for anti-neutrophil immunoglobulin G in a fixed neutrophil enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of neutrophil binding by immunoglobulin G and titers of anti-neutrophil immunoglobulin G in sera from patients with ulcerative colitis and patients with ulcerative colitis post colectomy were each significantly greater than the levels and titers for normal controls and patients with a variety of other colitides and diarrheal illnesses. Levels of neutrophil binding for colonic Crohn's disease, bacterial/amoebic colitis, the irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, and other miscellaneous diarrheal illnesses were not significantly different than the levels for normal controls. Although the levels of binding for collagenous colitis were significantly less than the levels for ulcerative colitis, they were significantly greater than the levels for normal controls. Patterns of neutrophil binding by serum samples that were positive in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Perinuclear staining was the predominant pattern shown by sera from patients with ulcerative colitis. The combination of a positive value in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a perinuclear immunofluorescence pattern",
