        "text": " diversion was palliative in all patients and followed pelvic exenteration in 4, debulking of pelvic tumor in 2 and radical cystectomy in 1, while 1 had inoperable bladder cancer. All patients had at least unilateral hydroureteronephrosis preoperatively. In each case a postoperative excretory urogram revealed significant improvement of the hydroureteronephrosis and the serum creatinine improved or stabilized. No patient had ureteral stomal stenosis or retraction. Mean survival was 5 months, with the longest survival being 1 year. Transureteroureterostomy in conjunction with terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy is an effective technique of urinary diversion in selected patients with a poor prognosis and advanced pelvic malignancy, decreasing operative time while avoiding the morbidity associated with a ureterointestinal operation or nephrostomy. \nEffect of a new synthetic ascorbic acid derivative as a free radical scavenger on the development of acute pancreatitis in mice. The therapeutic effects of CV 3611, a new synthetic free radical scavenger prepared from an ascorbic acid derivative, on choline deficient, ethionine enriched (CDE) diet induced acute pancreatitis in mice were evaluated and compared with those of superoxide dismutase. Time/course studies after subcutaneous injection of CV 3611 in normal mice showed a peak plasma concentration of mean (SEM) 0.54 (0.09) micrograms/ml at one hour, with a gradual decrease over the next 10 hours, while a peak concentration in pancreatic tissue of mean (SEM) 425 (33) ng/g tissue was achieved at three hours and the drug was undetectable at 12 hours. Survival rates and activities of pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase, elastase I) were compared in control mice and animals that received CV 3611 before or at the time of feeding the CDE diet. The survival rate was observed in a no treatment group and mice given pretreatment or treatment with CV 3611 or superoxide dismutase. The survival rate was significantly better in the treatment group given CV 3611 (p less than 0.02), but superoxide dismutase had no significant effect on survival. The increases in the three serum enzyme activities were significantly less at 48 hours in the groups given pretreatment or treatment with CV 3611 than in the no treatment group. These results indicate that CV 3611, which has been proved to pass through the cell membrane and to have a long half life in plasma and tissue, had an important therapeutic effect on the development of acute pancreatitis. They also suggest that oxygen derived free radicals may play an important role in the development of acute pancreatitis. \nPostheparin plasma diamine oxidase values in the follow up of patients with small bowel Crohn's disease. Measurement of postheparin plasma diamine oxidase (PHD) activity has been proposed to assess mucosal integrity in several diseases of the small intestine. In Crohn's disease, PHD values identify a group of patients with predominantly small bowel mucosal damage. To determine the role of mucosal involvement in the progression of small bowel Crohn's disease and whether different PHD values can predict different outcomes the changes in PHD values in 41 patients with small bowel Crohn's disease admitted consecutively to our department were investigated. The test was performed during periods of active disease and after either medical or surgical treatment had resulted in improvement. PHD values were significantly lower than in normal subjects (normal range 3.7-7.7 U/ml). In 35 patients with active disease (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) greater than 150) two groups were identified by choosing a cut off value of 2 U/ml: 93% of the 15 patients with PHD values lower than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 1.36 (0.46) U/ml) relapsed at least once in the following year, while only the 20% of the 20 whose values were higher than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 3.69 (1.50)) relapsed in the same period. The data were statistically significant (Yates's corrected chi 2 = 15.63; p less than 0.0001). The positive and negative predictive values of the test were 93% and 80%, respectively. During relapses, PHD values were consistently lower than previous values, and increased significantly after effective medical or surgical treatment. In the six patients in whom there were no changes in disease activity (CDAI persistently less than 150), there was no change in PHD values. \nFactors influencing outcome of prednisone dose reduction in myasthenia gravis. We reviewed retrospectively 114 prednisone dose reduction attempts in 63 myasthenic patients. Dose reduction was considered successful if a patient remained asymptomatic for more than 1 year on no prednisone or a stable low dose of prednisone. Successful dose reduction attempts were more common in patients taking azathioprine, but thymectomy did not influence taper outcome. Slower rate of dose reduction and higher ending dose of prednisone improved the chance of success. \nRevision osteoarticular allograft transplantation in weight-bearing joints. A clinical review. The early results of revision osteoarticular allografts in weight-bearing joints are reported. Sixteen consecutive patients underwent surgery over a six-year period between 1982 and 1988. At the time of review eight patients (50%) had surviving second allografts with an average follow-up time of 48 months (range 12 to 87). Five patients were graded excellent according to the Mankin scale, one good and two fair. Eight patients (50%) required further surgery, but only two patients came to amputation. \nControlled clinical trials of drug treatment for hypertension. A review. We reviewed the designs and major results of 17 large-scale, controlled, clinical trials that reported the effects of drug treatment for hypertension on morbidity or mortality. Seven trials conducted in study populations with more-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures 100-120 mm Hg or higher), including the more-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, showed large reductions in stroke, other \"hypertensive\" events, and, in one trial, total mortality. Of 11 trials in populations with less-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures predominantly below 105 mm Hg), including the less-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, nine met the criteria for pooling of results. Among the aggregate 43,000 patients in the nine trials who were followed up for an average of 5.6 years, mean diastolic blood pressure reduction was 5.8 mm Hg, and a significant 11% reduction in total mortality was observed. This benefit was largely attributable to a 38% reduction in fatal strokes; nonfatal strokes were similarly reduced. Coronary heart disease mortality was 8% lower in drug treatment than in control groups, but this difference was not significant. A similar result was observed for combined coronary mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction. A possible explanation for the inconclusive result regarding coronary end points was an adverse trend, observed in several trials, in a subgroup with baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities. Because all the trials except the propranolol arm of the Medical Research Council trial used drug regimens based on thiazide-like diuretic agents, and because there are now several new drug classes proposed as initial therapy, additional large-scale clinical trials may need to be considered. \nResting energy expenditure in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was determined in 30 patients with newly detected non-small cell lung cancer. Measured values were compared with the values predicted by the Harris-Benedict (HB) formula. Mean REE was 20% higher than predicted. Sixty percent of the patients (18 patients) had an elevated REE (greater than or equal to 115%) compared with this formula. The prevalence of hypermetabolism in a group of patients with gastric and colorectal cancer was only 13% (13 of 104 patients). When corrected for fat-free mass (FFM), REE was still significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in the lung cancer group compared with the gastric and colorectal cancer group. Whereas weight loss in healthy men leads to an adaptational decrease in energy expenditure (EE), weight loss in the patients with lung cancer was accompanied by an increase in REE. Tumor stage, tumor localization, pulmonary function, or smoking behavior could not explain the observed increase in REE in patients with lung cancer. Therefore, these metabolic alterations appear to be tumor mediated. \nGastric leiomyosarcoma. Prognostic factors and surgical management. Information on gastric leiomyosarcoma, such as important prognostic factors, patterns of disease recurrence, and optimal methods of treatment, are derived from limited patient experience. We address these questions, with specific focus on whether an advantage could be demonstrated for radical resection compared with wide local excision, by retrospectively investigating 53 patients who underwent surgical treatment at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. Abdominal pain and/or gastrointestinal bleeding associated with an intramural or exogastric mass were typical features of this disease. Only tumor size and histologic grade were statistically significant prognostic factors. With analysis of survival curves and patterns of recurrence, neither the addition of lymphadenectomy nor the wider tumor-free margins of a radical gastrectomy seemed superior to the more conservative local excision. Therefore, wide local excision remains the preferred treatment when technically feasible. \nAlveolitis correlates with clinical pulmonary involvement in primary Sjogren's syndrome. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 23 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (1Ss) and ten healthy controls to evaluate alveolitis and correlate it with pulmonary and systemic manifestations. Patients with 1Ss had higher BAL total cell count (9.2 +/- 6.7 millions/ml vs 6.1 +/- 2.9 millions/ml) and higher percentage of lymphocytes 23.3 +/- 15.6 percent vs 6.5 +/- 2.9 percent, p less than 0.001) than controls. Twelve patients (group A) constituted the \"high alveolitis\" group (lymphocytes greater than 15.2 percent) and ten (group B) constituted the \"low alveolitis\" group (lymphocytes less than 15.2 percent). Group A had more frequent cough (6/12 vs 2/10, p = 0.07), dyspnea (4/12 vs 1/10), and roentgenologic evidence of interstitial lung disease (5/12 vs 0/10, p less than 0.05). They also had lower total lung capacity (85.6 +/- 14.2 percent pred vs 105.8 +/- 23.3 percent pred, p less than 0.05) and Dco (87.7 +/- 20.6 percent pred vs 103.6 +/- 21.0 percent pred). All patients with +3 or +4 grading or lymphocytic infiltrates in lip biopsy specimen belonged in group A (5/12). Finally, T-helper/T-suppressor ratio was lower in group A than in group B. The intensity of alveolitis was not correlated with clinical or serologic manifestations of systemic disease. \nComparison of exercise radionuclide angiography with thallium SPECT imaging for detection of significant narrowing of the left circumflex coronary artery. Although quantitation of exercise thallium tomograms has enhanced the noninvasive diagnosis and localization of coronary artery disease, the detection of stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery remains suboptimal. Because posterolateral regional wall motion during exercise is well assessed by radionuclide angiography, this study determined whether regional dysfunction of the posterolateral wall during exercise radionuclide angiography is more sensitive in identifying left circumflex disease than thallium perfusion abnormalities assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). One hundred ten consecutive patients with CAD were studied, of whom 70 had a significant stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery or a major obtuse marginal branch. Both regional function and segmental thallium activity of the posterolateral wall were assessed using visual and quantitative analysis. Left ventricular regional function was assessed objectively by dividing the left ventricular region of interest into 20 sectors; the 8 sectors corresponding to the posterolateral free wall were used to assess function in the left circumflex artery distribution. Similarly, using circumferential profile analysis of short-axis thallium tomograms, left ventricular myocardial activity was subdivided into 64 sectors; the 16 sectors corresponding to the posterolateral region were used to assess thallium perfusion abnormalities in the left circumflex artery territory. Qualitative posterolateral wall motion analysis detected 76% of patients with left circumflex coronary artery stenosis, with a specificity of 83%, compared with only 44% by qualitative thallium tomography (p less than 0.001) and a specificity of 92%. Whereas quantitation of thallium activity increased the sensitivity for detecting left circumflex coronary artery stenosis to 80% with a specificity of 55%, it did not achieve statistical significance when compared with qualitative wall motion analysis. \nCerebrovascular hemodynamic changes associated with carotid endarterectomy. To evaluate the effect of carotid surgery on the cerebral circulation, transcranial Doppler sonography and ocular pneumoplethysmography were performed on 36 patients who underwent unilateral carotid endarterectomy. Ocular pneumoplethysmography and transcranial Doppler sonography tests were performed within a week before and after operation, and transcranial Doppler sonography was repeated greater than or equal to 30 days after operation. Middle and anterior cerebral arteries were insonated bilaterally, and flow velocities ipsilateral (iMCAFV or iACAFV) and contralateral (cMCAFV or cACAFV) to the side of surgery were recorded. The iMCAFV and iACAFV increased significantly in the immediate postoperative period, and the iMCAFV remained elevated on the second follow-up study. Patients with greater than or equal to 75% ipsilateral carotid stenosis (N = 23) had increased iMCAFV, iACAFV, and decreased cACAFV after operation, whereas those with less than 75% stenosis (N = 13) had no significant transcranial Doppler sonography changes. Those with greater than or equal to 75% contralateral carotid stenosis (N = 17) had significant increases in iMCAFV, cMCAFV, and iACAFV after operation, whereas those with less than 75% contralateral carotid stenosis had no significant transcranial Doppler sonography changes. A subset of patients (N = 13) did not increase iMCAFV after surgery. The ocular pneumoplethysmography changes were significantly different in both groups when preoperative and postoperative values were compared. We conclude that carotid endarterectomy can cause lasting cerebral hemodynamic changes, but that its effects are not uniform among all patients. \nIschaemic myelopathy secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation in AIDS. A 39-year-old patient with AIDS presented with a rapidly progressive myelopathy with a partial Brown-Sequard syndrome. He died, 9 weeks after onset of the first neurological signs, from diffuse encephalopathy. Neuropathological examination revealed multiple, usually small, frequently haemorrhagic, infarcts or various ages and numerous fibrin thrombi in medium and small penetrating vessels and capillaries of the brain and spinal cord, characteristic of disseminated intravascular coagulation. There were no inflammatory changes. Immunohistochemical studies for human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 were negative. Ischaemic spinal cord lesions due to disseminated intravascular coagulation may represent an unusual cause of focal, non-inflammatory, non-tumoral, myelopathic syndrome in AIDS. \nPapaveretum infusions in infants under 6 months of age. The effectiveness of a continuous low dose papaveretum infusion for the relief of postoperative pain was assessed in 29 infants aged 1-6 months nursed on the infant surgical ward following major abdominal surgery. Trained nursing staff were able to adjust the dosage within prescribed guidelines and satisfactory analgesia was obtained with a regimen which delivered up to 0.0375 mg/kg/hour, approximately half the dose recommended in children older than 12 months. There was one case of clinically significant respiratory depression. \nNonparallel effects of renin inhibitor treatment on plasma renin activity and angiotensins I and II in hypertensive subjects. An assay-related artifact. Nonparallel effects of renin inhibitor treatment on plasma renin activity (PRA) and the plasma levels of angiotensins (ANG), as well as on blood pressure, have been observed in subjects with hypertension. This study addresses the possibility that renin inhibitors may show a high degree of plasma protein binding in vivo and that displacement of protein-bound inhibitor during the assay of PRA in vitro may lead to overestimation of renin inhibition. Indeed, with the ultrafiltration technique it was found that 96% of the novel renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892, when added to EDTA plasma, was bound to protein. The angiotensinase inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 8-hydroxy-quinoline sulfate (8-OHQ), which are currently used in PRA assays, caused a displacement of protein-bound inhibitor, thereby increasing its free concentration. This displacement was sufficient to explain the reduction in IC 50 of Ro 42-5892, which was seen in the PRA assay when PMSF and 8-OHQ were added to plasma. Such reductions in IC 50 were also seen with the renin inhibitors CGP 29-287, CGP 38-560A, and SR 43-845. When Ro 42-5892 was given, 1 mg/kg intravenously in 10 min, to subjects with hypertension, it appeared that plasma ANG I and II returned to baseline after 6-8 h, whereas PRA measured in the presence of PMSF and 8-OHQ was still suppressed. However, when PRA was measured without these angiotensinase inhibitors, the inhibition of PRA was parallel to the suppression of ANG I and II. \nInternal mammary artery to lung parenchyma fistula after aortocoronary bypass grafting. Two unusual cases of internal mammary artery fistulization to lung parenchyma after coronary revascularization are reported. They were incidentally discovered during coronary angiography, and one of them was successfully closed with a percutaneous transvenous coil-spring occluder. The cause is thought to be the direct contact between the dissected mammary artery pedicle and the lung parenchyma. \nQuickscan: Doppler ultrasound emulation of angiography--its value prior to arteriography in peripheral vascular disease. The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease demands a quick, reliable, non-invasive technique for initial assessment. We have devised a new method which combines the two physical principles that (1) Doppler shift is proportional to blood velocity and (2) blood velocity is inversely proportional to arterial cross-section with the ability to track probe position using a non-contacting method. An image of the probe track and any arterial narrowing is shown superimposed on an outline of the patient. Pressure measurement, scan and graphics with final report take about 20 minutes. The accuracy of this system in peripheral vascular disease was evaluated. Thirty-one patients underwent quickscan (QS) and arteriography within an average time of 7 days. Abdominal aorta, common iliac-common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal artery segments were graded independently as normal, significant stenosis (greater than 50% of diameter) or occluded by both techniques. Of 197 segments, QS correctly assessed 106 normal, 22 stenosed and 28 occluded segments. Four equivocal angiographic stenoses were normal on QS and three severe stenoses were graded occlusion. Fifteen segments on angiography and five on QS were not assessed. For the iliac and superficial femoral artery segments, sensitivity and specificity averaged 77% and 86%, respectively, for all grades. Aortic statistics were invalid (only one significant lesion). Six out of eight popliteal occlusions were correctly diagnosed by QS, but no popliteal stenoses were detected out of six shown on arteriography. Low numbers may contribute to this discrepancy but an improved popliteal scanning method may be necessary. We find initial QS an invaluable aid to direct percutaneous angiography and to indicate potential sites for angioplasty. \nResection and reconstruction of the carotid bifurcation with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts; operative technique. Preliminary results in 25 procedures and indications. Although carotid endarterectomy is the standard procedure, the purpose of this paper is to describe a new surgical technique and indicate its role in the surgery of cervical cerebrovascular disease. The technique consists of resection of the pathologic carotid artery bifurcation followed by its total replacement with a bifurcated thin-wall polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft constructed by the surgeon. Prosthetic graft reconstruction of the carotid bifurcation (PGRCB) was performed in 21 patients (25 procedures) from November 1984 to May 1987. Many patients were over 70 years old. The indications for surgery were transient ischemic attacks (TIA)'s in 10 patients (high-grade stenosis), established stroke with mild deficit in 3 patients (high-grade stenosis). Eight patients (high-grade stenosis) were asymptomatic and 4 had vertebro-basilar symptoms. In 11 procedures the indications were the same as for standard carotid endarterectomy (significant stenosis and/or ulcerated plaque). In 14 cases, the procedure was justified by extensive lesions involving a long segment of the internal carotid artery (2 restenoses, 12 calcified lesions). In the perioperative period, there were no deaths and no TIA's. The 25 procedures were assessed one month postoperatively by ultrasonic imaging and venous substraction angiography. All the grafts were patent with perfect restoration of the carotid bifurcation anatomy. Systematic follow-up study was carried out in 1987. Three patients had died of non-neurologic causes and one was lost to study. The remaining 19 procedures were evaluated with an average follow-up of 19 months (range 7 to 32 months). The patients were asymptomatic and all the grafts remained patent including one stenosis (greater than 50%) at the common carotid artery anastomosis. Because recent studies have documented a much higher rate of technical defects or recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy, we believe that PGRCB merits consideration, particularly in difficult endarterectomies, and in recurrent carotid stenosis. Furthermore it seems acceptable to advocate PGRCB in aneurysms of the internal carotid artery and in post-irradiation arteritis. \nStructural abnormalities of the craniofacial complex and congenital malformations. This article was meant to be a very cursory survey of the multiple defects that abnormal development can produce in all areas of the craniofacial complex. Careful examination for these abnormalities should lead the clinician to earlier referral of patients for additional examination by a genetics team. This often enables more focused care for the individual and better counseling concerning future pregnancies. Aase points out that \"funny looking face\" or \"syndromic facies\" is no longer helpful. Accurate assessment of the face with measurement leads to better diagnosis and ultimately better patient care. All children with facial defects deserve early intervention by a multidisciplined craniofacial team including geneticists, surgeons, dentists, speech pathologists, and other specialists. Part of the process of early referral to this team involves early detection and recognition in the neonatal period. It is hoped that this article stimulates the pediatrician to be aware of these abnormalities, recognize their importance, and seek additional help for patients, no matter what their age. \nImmaturity and aneuploidy in human oocytes after different stimulation protocols. OBJECTIVE: To study immaturity and aneuploidy in human oocytes after two different stimulation protocols. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Outpatient IVF clinic/laboratory. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-three patients of whom 65 were stimulated with clomiphene citrate (CC)/human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and 78 were stimulated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a)/hMG. Only patients with at least one oocyte unfertilized were included in this study. RESULTS: Stimulation with GnRH-a/hMG, as compared with CC/hMG stimulation, resulted in larger numbers of oocytes (P less than 0.00001), a higher fertilization rate (P less than 0.02), and oocyte retrieval at a later average cycle day (P less than 0.000005). Cytogenetic findings of immaturity were observed in 33.9% of unfertilized oocytes after CC/hMG stimulation, compared with only 17.8% after GnRH-a/hMG stimulation (P less than 0.0005). Aneuploidy findings were the same for both groups. CONCLUSION: In GnRH-a/hMG stimulation, oocytes approach the normal day of ovulation more closely. This may allow for better oocyte maturation and higher fertilization and pregnancy rates. \nComparison of intravenous bolus injection or continuous infusion of recombinant single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (saruplase) for thrombolysis. A canine model of combined coronary arterial and femoral venous thrombosis. The thrombolytic efficacy of recombinant unglycosylated full length single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA, saruplase), applied either as single intravenous bolus or as a continuous infusion over 60 minutes, was studied in 5 randomized blinded groups of 5 dogs with combined copper coil induced coronary artery thrombosis and 125I-fibrin labeled femoral vein clots. Infusion of 1 mg/kg recu-PA (group I) induced coronary recanalization in 4 of 5 dogs and 98 +/- 1% (mean +/- SEM) venous clot lysis. Bolus injection of 1 mg/kg recu-PA (group II) caused reflow in 3 of 5 dogs and 88 +/- 5 percent venous clot lysis. Infusion of 0.5 mg/kg rescu-PA (group III) achieved reflow in 3 of 5 dogs and 52 +/- 6% venous clot lysis. Bolus injection of 0.5 mg/kg rscu-PA (group IV) induced reflow in 4 of 5 dogs and 48 +/- 12% venous clot lysis. Placebo infusion (group V) was associated with late recanalization in 1 of 5 dogs and 18 +/- 8% venous clot lysis. Coronary artery reocclusion after reflow was not observed in groups I and II, but occurred in 2 of 3 animals in group III and in 3 of 4 animals in group IV (P = .02). The time to reflow in responsive animals was 22 +/- 5 minutes with infusion of 0.5 or 1 mg/kg rscu-PA and 14 +/- 1 minute with bolus injection of 0.5 or 1 mg/kg (P = .14). Depletion of fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin to less than 25% of baseline levels was observed in the 5 dogs given 1 mg/kg rscu-PA by bolus and in 3 of the 5 dogs given 1 mg/kg rscu-PA via infusion, but in none of the dogs that received 0.5 mg/kg rscu-PA (P less than .001). Plasma clearance rates were 170 +/- 44 and 230 +/- 30 mL/minute after bolus injection and 190 +/- 47 and 310 +/- 56 mL/minute during infusion of rscu-PA for the 1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg doses respectively. Thus, intravenous bolus injection of rscu-PA (saruplase) appears to be equipotent to an infusion over 60 minutes for both coronary and venous thrombolysis. This animal model of combined arterial and venous thrombolysis may be useful for the evaluation of new thrombolytic strategies. \nAdrenal carcinoma presenting with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. A 63-year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination and ultrasound revealed bilateral atrophy of the ovaries and a uterus of 8.8 x 3.3 x 4.0 cm. Serum estradiol (E2) was 300 pg/mL. Cushing syndrome was diagnosed biochemically, and computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a 5-cm left adrenal mass and tumors in the liver and lung. A pathologic diagnosis of metastatic adrenal carcinoma was made after surgery. This case demonstrates that adrenal carcinoma can produce high E2 levels in a postmenopausal woman, leading to uterine enlargement and vaginal bleeding. Adrenal carcinoma should therefore be included in the differential diagnosis of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. \nPlasma endothelin in human essential hypertension. Plasma endothelin immunoreactivity was measured in normal controls, in mild essential hypertensive patients with no antihypertensive treatment, in moderate to severe hypertensives whose blood pressure was controlled by treatment, and in moderate to severe hypertensives whose blood pressure was not controlled by treatment. Endothelin immunoreactivity levels in plasma in the four groups were similar, but had a positive correlation with blood pressure in hypertensives although not in normotensives. The concentration in plasma of both C-terminal and N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide also had a positive correlation with blood pressure in these hypertensive patients. We conclude that if plasma immunoreactive endothelin levels represent the result of endothelial production of endothelin, in absence of changes in catabolism of the peptide, essential hypertensive patients do not appear to have increased production of endothelin. \nEffects of ultrasound and trolamine salicylate phonophoresis on delayed-onset muscle soreness. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ultrasound and phonophoresis using an anti-inflammatory-analgesic cream (trolamine salicylate) on delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Repeated eccentric contractions were used to induce DOMS in the elbow flexors of 40 college-aged women. Subjects were then assigned randomly to one of four groups: (1) group 1 (n = 10) received sham ultrasound using placebo cream, (2) group 2 (n = 10) received sham ultrasound using trolamine salicylate cream, (3) group 3 (n = 10) received ultrasound using placebo cream, and (4) group 4 (n = 10) received ultrasound using trolamine salicylate cream. Subjects were treated on 3 consecutive days. Muscle soreness and active elbow range of motion were assessed daily prior to each treatment. The subjects in group 3 experienced an increase in DOMS, whereas no increase in soreness was observed in the subjects in group 4. The authors concluded that ultrasound enhanced the development of DOMS but that this enhancement was offset by the anti-inflammatory-analgesic action of salicylate phonophoresis. These findings suggest that salicylate phonophoresis may be useful in clinical situations in which it is desirable to administer ultrasound without increasing inflammation. \nInsulin and glucagon levels in fulminant hepatic failure in man. The behavior of insulin and glucagon and related metabolic substrates was assayed in plasma of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. All 12 subjects were provided the same nutritional support. High levels of insulin and glucagon were present at all times and no difference was observed between surviving patients (four) and those who died (8). Elevated values for branched-chain and aromatic amino acids as well as alanine were present. Statistically significant lower levels of aromatic amino acids and consequently a greater branched chain-aromatic amino acid ratio was found in surviving vs nonsurviving patients. A significantly greater level of alpha-fetoprotein was found in patients who survived as compared to those who died. \nFlecainide in the treatment of fetal tachycardias. Fourteen mothers were treated with flecainide for fetal atrial tachycardias associated with intrauterine cardiac failure. Twelve of the 14 fetuses responded by conversion to sinus rhythm. One of the 12 fetuses subsequently died in utero. The remaining fetuses suffered no morbidity and were alive and well 3 months to 2 years after delivery. The two fetuses in whom atrial tachycardia did not convert with flecainide were successfully treated with digoxin. These results compare favourably with previous forms of antiarrhythmic treatment. After recent reports of the side effects of flecainide treatment, however, it has been advised that this drug should be confined to high risk patients and those with life threatening arrhythmias. The use of flecainide for fetal arrhythmias should be limited to patients with severe fetal hydrops and supraventricular tachycardias. It should not be the first drug of choice in atrial flutter. \nThe study of serum apoprotein levels as indicators for the severity of angiographically assessed coronary artery disease. Serum apoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and B (Apo-B) concentrations were determined in 40 subjects undergoing coronary angiography for past myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, and the authors studied the relationship between the apoprotein concentrations and the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). During this study, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were determined to control analysis. The results showed that the decrease in serum Apo A-I levels was the best indicator distinguishing CAD from non-coronary artery disease; the Apo B/Apo A-I ratio had the most consistent association with the severity of CAD as assessed by angiography; Apo B/Apo A-I values ranging from 0.98 to 1.00 might be considered critical values for early CAD. \nCost effectiveness of incremental programmes for lowering serum cholesterol concentration: is individual intervention worth while? OBJECTIVE--To evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of various cholesterol lowering programmes. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis. SETTING--Norwegian cholesterol lowering programme in Norwegian male population aged 40-49 (n = 200,000), whose interventions comprise a population based promotion of healthier eating habits, dietary treatment (subjects with serum cholesterol concentration 6.0-7.9 mmol/l), and dietary and drug treatment combined (serum cholesterol concentration greater than or equal to 8.0 mmol/l). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Marginal cost effectiveness ratios--that is, the ratio of net treatment costs (cost of treatment minus savings in treatment costs for coronary heart disease) to life years gained and to quality of life years (QALYs) saved. RESULTS--The cost per life year gained over 20 years of a population based strategy was projected to be 12 pounds. For an individual strategy based on dietary treatment the cost was about 12,400 pounds per life year gained and 111,600 pounds if drugs were added for 50% of the subjects with serum cholesterol concentrations greater than or equal to 8.0 mmol/l. CONCLUSIONS--The results underline the importance of marginal cost effectiveness analyses for incremental programmes of health care. The calculations of QALYs, though speculative, indicate that individual intervention should be implemented cautiously and within more selected groups than currently recommended. Drugs should be reserved for subjects with genetic hypercholesterolaemia or who are otherwise at very high risk of arteriosclerotic disease. \nCongestive gastropathy and Helicobacter pylori: an endoscopic and morphometric study. Congestive gastropathy is a frequent cause of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension. The pathogenesis is thought to involve venous congestion with gastric mucosal capillary dilatation. We studied the relation between gastric mucosal capillary dilatation, measured morphometrically, and endoscopic appearances in 74 patients with portal hypertension and 20 control subjects. We also investigated the frequency of gastric colonisation with Helicobacter pylori. Mucosal capillaries in patients were significantly dilated compared with control subjects (p less than 0.001) but the degree of dilatation was not related to the severity of the endoscopic appearances. H pylori was identified in 19 of 74 (26%) patients but was not related to the severity of the endoscopic appearances. These results suggest that other factors in addition to mucosal venous and capillary congestion are important in the pathogenesis of endoscopic congestive gastropathy and that gastric colonisation with H pylori is unlikely to be one of these factors. \nCarotid and coronary atherosclerosis. What are the connections? In recent years research has revealed an association between carotid atherosclerosis and coronary atherosclerosis that parallels the long-recognized association between clinically manifest cerebrovascular disease and clinically manifest coronary artery disease (CAD). Validation of B-mode ultrasonography as a method for quantitative imaging of the extracranial carotid arteries has made it possible to identify risk factors for extracranial carotid atherosclerosis and its progression and to test pharmacologic agents for their ability to retard that progression. Extent of atherosclerosis in the extracranial carotid arteries has been shown to be a risk factor or \"marker\" for symptomatic CAD. In addition, CAD has been identified as an important predictor of progression of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis. \nNeurologic complications of infective endocarditis. Neurologic syndromes often complicate the management of infective endocarditis (IE). We retrospectively reviewed 166 episodes of native valve endocarditis to assess the occurrence and implications of nonfocal encephalopathy, meningitis, salient headache, back pain, and brain abscess. Neurologic complications occurred in 35% (58/166) of patients: 41% (54/133) of mitral or aortic valve IE and 12% (4/33) of tricuspid valve IE. Of 133 cases of mitral or aortic valve IE, encephalopathy occurred in 14%, meningitis in 5%, and salient headache in 3%. All neurologic complications occurred more often with Staphylococcus aureus infection (67%) than with viridans streptococci (22%), including encephalopathy (22% versus 7%), meningitis (17% versus 0%), stroke (39% versus 16%), and death (39% versus 9%). Encephalopathy was associated with virulent organisms, increased patient age, and uncontrolled infection. Clinical, radiologic, and neuropathologic data all suggest that infective microemboli are often etiologic in IE-related encephalopathy. There were no macroscopic brain abscesses clinically identified. Meningitis occurred only with virulent organisms. While many clinical aspects of IE have changed in recent years, the frequency and gravity of neurologic complications have not. \nCytogenetic abnormalities in uterine leiomyomata. Uterine leiomyomata are thought to be monoclonal tumors; however, the factors involved in the neoplastic proliferation of uterine leiomyomata are unknown. The purpose of the present study was to characterize uterine leiomyomata using cytogenetic techniques. Thirteen leiomyoma specimens were obtained by hysterectomy or myomectomy. Short-term cultures were successfully established for all specimens, and metaphase spreads were prepared by conventional techniques. Clonal chromosome rearrangements were detected in seven leiomyoma specimens (54%). These rearrangements involved chromosome bands 12q14-15 in five specimens, including three tumors with a specific translocation, t(12;14)(q14-15;q23-24). Chromosome rearrangements involving chromosome band 7q22 were identified in two specimens. A normal 46,XX karyotype was observed in six specimens. Myometrial specimens from two patients with abnormal leiomyoma karyotypes were normal cytogenetically. These results suggest that spontaneous chromosome rearrangements may be responsible for the initiation and proliferation of leiomyoma growth. \nComposite tissue transfer in limb-salvage surgery. After extensive resection due to extremity sarcoma, the inability to cover the defect for satisfactory healing and limb function has been an indication for amputation rather than limb salvage. We report herein our experience with seven limb-salvage cases in which we closed difficult and complex defects with composite tissue transfers utilizing microvascular techniques. Free-flap transfers were used to cover soft-tissue defects after extensive resection of primary and locally recurrent tumor and to manage radiation-induced complications. The grafts healed well when infected irradiated tissue was covered, and the grafts tolerated postoperative irradiation. Composite tissue transfer also provided soft-tissue coverage around distal joints that would not have been adequately protected with a skin graft. Complications were minimal, and all patients maintained good extremity function. No patient who underwent composite tissue transfer has had a local recurrence. A free-flap composite tissue transfer can extend the indications for limb-salvage surgery and offers an alternative to amputation in selected patients. \nNitroprusside in preeclampsia. Circulatory distress and paradoxical bradycardia. In severe preeclampsia, short-term peripartum management of hypertension with hydralazine is complicated by relatively prolonged hypotensive episodes, resulting in fetal distress. We hypothesized that nitroprusside's rapid onset and brief antihypertensive action would permit more controlled blood pressure reduction. Nitroprusside was infused into 10 invasively monitored subjects until mean arterial pressure either 1) was gradually reduced 10-20% or 2) fell abruptly. Subjects fell into two groups, defined by whether the hypotensive effect of nitroprusside was accompanied by a fall in heart rate (group A, n = 8) or a rise (group B, n = 2). Group B showed the expected sinoaortic baroreceptor reflex elevations in heart rate (+17 +/- 6 beats/min) in response to moderate falls in mean arterial pressure (-32 +/- 9 mm Hg) elicited by moderate doses (1.03 +/- 0.23 micrograms/kg/min). However in group A, steep reductions in mean arterial pressure (-75 +/- 22 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001), significantly greater than in group B (p less than 0.05), occurred at much lower doses (0.35 +/- 0.23 micrograms/kg/min; p less than 0.05) and were accompanied by falls in heart rate (-21 +/- 7 beats/min). The apparently paradoxical falls in heart rate and extreme hypotensive responses in group A indicate severe circulatory compromise, corresponding to the cardiac and vasomotor depression that characterizes severe hemorrhage and other forms of acute/severe hypovolemic hypotension. This hemodynamic pattern represents a cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex presumably related to the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. The appearance of this pattern in the present study probably reflects the imposition of nitroprusside's prominent venous dilator action on the relatively reduced blood volume that generally characterizes severe preeclampsia. \nCaptopril protects against myocardial injury induced by magnesium deficiency. We have previously reported that antioxidant drug intervention protects against magnesium deficiency-induced myocardial lesions. In the present study, Golden Syrian male hamsters were fed either a magnesium-deficient diet or a magnesium-supplemented diet. Animals from each group received sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors: captopril, epi-captopril (a stereoisomer of captopril), and zofenopril* (arginine blend of zofenopril containing a free SH group); another group of animals received the non-sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat. The animals were killed after 14 days, and their hearts were isolated for morphological and morphometric analyses. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were examined by a computer image analysis system for a morphometric determination of the severity of myocardial injury. Captopril reduced both the density of lesions, from 0.32 to 0.08 lesions/(mm2) (p less than 0.01), and the area fraction of lesions, from 7.42 x 10(-4) to 2.03 x 10(-4) lesion area/(mm2) (p less than 0.01), as well as the degree of inflammatory infiltration around the blood vessels. Epi-captopril and zofenopril* were virtually equipotent to captopril, but enalaprilat afforded only slight (nonsignificant) protection. These results indicate that a significant component of the protective effect of captopril in this model was attributable to its sulfhydryl moiety, rather than solely due to the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme. These data further support our previous findings of possible free radical participation in cardiomyopathy due to magnesium deficiency. \nA prospective randomized trial of adjuvant chemotherapy with bolus versus continuous infusion of doxorubicin in patients with high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcoma and an analysis of prognostic factors. A prospective randomized trial was conducted to compare the cardiotoxic and therapeutic effects of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks) administered by bolus or 72-hour continuous infusion as adjuvant chemotherapy in 82 eligible patients after resection of high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or superficial trunk. Cardiac toxicity, defined as a 10% or greater decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction as assessed by radionuclide cineangiography, was evaluated in 69 patients. Cardiotoxicity was seen in 61% of patients in the bolus treatment arm with the median doxorubicin dose of 420 mg/m2. Among patients who received continuous infusion, 42% had cardiotoxicity with a median dose of 540 mg/m2. The rate of cardiotoxicity as a function of the cumulative dose of doxorubicin was significantly higher in the bolus treatment arm (P = 0.0017). Two patients in each group had clinical congestive heart failure, with one cardiac death occurring in each. There was a trend toward a lower rate of metastasis (P = 0.19) and a significantly lower rate of death of disease (P = 0.036) for patients treated with the bolus dose. Cox model analysis identified three unfavorable characteristics for the rate of developing a distant metastasis: blood transfusion within 24 hours of operation (P less than 0.00001), tumor deep to the fascia and 5 cm or more in size (P = 0.0043), and a histologic subtype other than liposarcoma (P = 0.0002). The unfavorable effect of continuous infusion was not selected in the model (P = 0.16). Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with soft tissue sarcoma is investigational. Furthermore, the impact of perioperative blood transfusion merits further study. \nInfluence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on pump function and cardiac contractility in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Eleven patients with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure were studied before and three months after the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was added to their frusemide medication. The following were measured: left ventricular pressure and volume with transient occlusion of the inferior vena cava, radionuclide angiography, and hormone concentrations in plasma. As in other reported studies, the clinical condition of the patients improved and their exercise tolerance increased moderately. Addition of enalapril reduced end diastolic and systolic pressure, reduced ventricular volume, and concomitantly increased the ejection fraction. The end systolic pressure-volume relation shifted to the left as it did in a similar animal study. In the animal study unloading by a vasodilator did not induce a leftward shift, so it can be inferred that in the present study unloading combined with a decrease in the angiotensin concentration was instrumental in remodelling the heart. Though unloading was expected to have a beneficial effect on the oxygen supply/demand ratio of the heart, the patients still showed the same drop in the ejection fraction during exercise as they did before treatment with enalapril, and early diastolic filling did not improve. Normally, regression of cardiac dilatation is only found if pump function improves; the present study showed that unloading in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reshapes the ventricle without improving intrinsic pump function. \nFeeding regimens after pyloromyotomy. In a prospective randomized study three different feeding regimens after operation were compared in 74 babies with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: gradual regarding of feeds over 48 h (regimen 1), rapid regarding of feeds over 16 h (regimen 2), and initial starvation followed by full normal feeds at 24 h (regimen 3). No significant difference between the treatment groups was found either in episodes of vomiting after operation (regimen 1, 2.9 episodes in 21 patients; regimen 2, 3.6 episodes in 28 patients; regimen 3, 3.6 episodes in 25 patients) or in the mean duration of postoperative hospital stay (regimen 1, 59.3 h; regimen 2, 47.8 h; regimen 3, 56.7 h). We conclude that vomiting following pyloromyotomy is self-limiting and independent of the timetable or composition of the postoperative dietary regimen. \nEmergency treatment of headache. Headache is a frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department. Once a diagnosis is established, and significant organic disease can be ruled out, relief of pain must be addressed. Referral for follow-up care and narcotic habituation is a recurrent problem for the emergency physician. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of headache, evaluation of the emergency room patient, and treatment of the patient with headache. \nNeutrophils express the high affinity receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RI, CD64) after in vivo application of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Fc receptors are important effector molecules of neutrophilic granulocytes (polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMN]), connecting phagocytic cells and the specific immune response. Neutrophils from healthy donors express the low-affinity receptors for IgG Fc gamma RII (CD32) and Fc gamma RIII (CD16), but not the high-affinity receptor Fc gamma RI (CD64). The latter has been found on neutrophils from patients with certain bacterial infections and can be induced in vitro after incubation with interferon-gamma. We show here that neutrophils strongly express Fc gamma RI after in vivo application of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). PMN from patients receiving rhG-CSF displayed higher cytotoxicity against Daudi lymphoma cells in vitro compared with control patients and with healthy donors. Fab fragments against Fc gamma RII (monoclonal antibody [MoAb] IV.3) inhibited neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity of healthy donors but not of patients during rhG-CSF therapy. Therefore, expression of Fc receptors by PMN was investigated by flow cytometry and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was compared. After staining with MoAb 32.2 against Fc gamma RL, the median MFI of neutrophils from G-CSF patients (median, 4.78; range, 2.40 to 8.50; n = 5) was significantly higher (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively) than the median MFI of patients not receiving G-CSF (median, 1.23; range, 1.01 to 1.58; n = 6) and the median MFI of healthy donors (median, 1.04; range, 0.67 to 1.12; n = 6). Fc gamma RI disappeared after the discontinuing of the G-CSF injections, but was reinduced during the next treatment cycle with rhG-CSF. The high expression of Fc gamma RI during rhG-CSF therapy correlated with enhanced cytotoxicity. In vitro incubation with rhG-CSF also enhances cytotoxicity, but only minor increments in Fc gamma RI expression were observed. Thus, during in vivo application of rhG-CSF neutrophils acquire an additional potent receptor for mediating tumor cell killing in vitro by induction of the high-affinity receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RI, CD64). \nManagement of intraoperative rupture of aneurysm without hypotension. A retrospective analysis was performed on all aneurysms operated on by one of us (SLG) from July 1980 to October 1988 to determine the factors that govern outcome from the intraoperative rupture of aneurysms. A total of 276 consecutive surgical procedures for 317 intracranial aneurysms produced 41 perioperative or intraoperative ruptures for analysis. Five cases were pre-exposure ruptures, 3 of which occurred during anesthetic induction. Four of these patients died, and 1 made a good recovery. Of the remaining 36 cases, outcome was analyzed in terms of the adjuncts used to deal with the intraoperative rupture. There was no statistically significant difference in outcome between those cases in which tamponade was used to control hemorrhage versus temporary clipping; however, those cases in which hypotension was used did less well than those in which it was not used. From October 1986 to October 1988, 108 operations for 132 aneurysms were performed without the use of induced hypotension. There were 16 intraoperative ruptures (14.8%). All 16 of these patients made a good recovery. In the group before 1986, of which there were 20 intraoperative ruptures (of 168 operations, 11.9%), 11 of those 20 patients suffered a permanent deficit or died. We conclude that hypotension may not be a necessary adjunct to the management of intraoperative rupture of aneurysms. \nVaccination for prevention of CAPD associated staphylococcal infection: results of a prospective multicentre clinical trial. 124 stable CAPD patients from 8 Australian and 3 New Zealand centers were randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to one of two groups to study the effect of vaccination using commercial preparations consisting of a combined staphylococcus toxoid and whole killed staphylococci (SB) or normal saline solution (SS) on the incidence of peritonitis and exit site infection and S. aureus nasal carriage over a 12-month prospective period. In addition, levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C4 were monitored during the trial period in serum and dialysate; serum levels of anti-alpha hemolysin and dialysate levels of fibronectin and specific antistaphylococcal antibodies were also measured. Over the period, treatment with SB or SS did not affect the incidence of peritonitis, catheter-related infection or S. aureus nasal carriage. However, vaccination with SB elicited a significant increase in the level of serum anti-alpha hemolysin throughout the 12 month duration of the study, although the level of increase was unrelated to the subsequent rate of peritonitis. Vaccination with SB but not SS elicited a significant increase in the dialysate level of specific antibodies against S. aureus. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, complement C3 and C4 were within the normal range in the CAPD patients studied and remained unaffected by vaccination with SB. In addition, dialysate levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, complement C3 and C4 were 50-100 times lower than corresponding serum levels and remained unaffected by vaccination. In summary, immunisation with an anti-staphylococcal agent was not successful in reducing peritonitis or exit site infection in CAPD patients. \nTransfusion-related chronic liver disease in sickle cell anemia. The medical records and liver biopsies of nine sickle cell patients with chronically elevated liver function tests were retrospectively reviewed to determine the etiology of chronic liver disease. There were eight women and one man with a mean age of 30 yr. All patients had hemoglobin SS. Eight patients were referred for elevated aminotransferases and one for an elevated alkaline phosphatase. Hemosiderosis was present in all of the biopsies. Two patients had cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis was noted in two patients, and five patients had cholestasis. Two patients had serologic markers demonstrating HBV exposure but no patients were HBsAg positive. Erythrophagocytosis, sinusoidal dilatation, and Kupffer cell hyperplasia were present in all of the liver biopsies. Transfusion-related causes were the most common significant pathologic findings in our patients, and appeared to be the etiologies of chronic liver disease in sickle cell patients. \nThe effects of L-dopa on excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. We examined the effects of L-dopa on the excessive daytime sleepiness of six narcoleptic patients while using a double-blind design and objective measurements of vigilance. The two treatment periods, L-dopa or placebo, lasted for 2 weeks each, separated by a 1-week washout period. In addition to the standard Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), two different tests assessed the daytime vigilance: the Analogue Vigilance Scale (AVS) and the Four Choice Reaction Time Test (FCRTT). L-dopa improved vigilance and performance as evaluated by the AVS and the FCRTT, while the capacity to fall asleep rapidly remained unchanged as evaluated by the MSLT. Results of the present study suggest that L-dopa is effective in improving the vigilance level of narcoleptic patients and raises the hypothesis that dopamine may play a role in the physiopathology of excessive daytime sleepiness of this condition. \nExtremely high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels at second-trimester screening. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening is widely used for the detection of open neural tube defects (NTDs) and a variety of other anomalies and complications. We examined the outcomes of 44 pregnancies with MSAFP elevations of 8 or more multiples of the median (MoM) from among 40,676 screened pregnancies. At the initial evaluation by ultrasound, 82% of the patients had at least one finding that may have accounted for the elevation. Approximately 45% of the fetuses had a major fetal anomaly, 25% died, 16% had an identifiable placental abnormality, and 5% had an underestimation of gestational age; 18% of the elevations remained unexplained after ultrasound. In follow-up of the pregnancies, all of those with an unexplained elevation after initial ultrasound had at least one obstetric complication or placental abnormality. The overall positive predictive value of an MSAFP value of 8 or more MoM for NTDs was 22.7%. The proportion of infants born alive in the overall group was low, with only 16 live births among 46 fetuses. The majority of the nonviable outcomes were associated with a fetus with a major anomaly that was terminated or died before 20 weeks. Of the live-born infants, 31% had a major anomaly, 19% had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and an anomaly, 12.5% had IUGR without an anomaly, and 25% were preterm. Eighty-eight percent of those pregnancies with a live-born infant had at least one obstetric complication. Among pregnancies with MSAFP of 8 or more MoM, the majority are associated with large structural fetal anomalies or fetal death before 20 weeks. \nBone marrow dosimetry in rats using direct tissue counting after injection of radio-iodinated intact monoclonal antibodies or F(ab')2 fragments. Normal rats were injected intravenously with 131I- and 125I-labeled intact murine and chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies directed against carcinoembryonic antigen or with the corresponding F(ab')2 fragments. At different times after injection, individual animals were killed and radioactivity of blood and major organs, including bones and bone marrow, was determined. Ratios comparing radioactivity concentration in different tissues with that of bone marrow were calculated and found to remain stable during several effective half-lives of the antibodies. Mean bone marrow radioactivity was 35% (range, 29%-40%) of that of blood and 126% (range, 108%-147%) of that of liver after injection of intact Mabs or F(ab')2 fragments. In nude rats bearing human colon carcinoma xenografts producing carcinoembryonic antigen, relative bone marrow radioactivity was slightly lower than that in normal rats. \nA comparative trial of the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Outcome in 3- to 8-month-old infants, 9- to 23-month-old infants and children, and 24- to 30-month-old children. The reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids were compared in 139 infants aged 3 to 8 months, 60 infants and children aged 9 to 23 months, and 99 children aged 24 to 30 months. Good antibody responses to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and agglutinogens occurred in all age groups after both the third and fourth doses. After the fourth (booster) dose, the mean antibody values in initially seronegative infants vaccinated at 3 to 8 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 67.8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU) per milliliter; anti-FHA, 149.5 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 125.6. The values in initially seronegative children vaccinated at 24 to 30 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 92.9 EU/mL; anti-FHA, 251.7 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 275.8. Reactions following immunization were minimal. Except for drowsiness after the first dose in infants, there were no clinically significant differences in reactions between infants and older children. The findings in this study coupled with the recent demonstration of efficacy of this vaccine in 2-year-old children supports the recent Japanese recommendation to lower the age of immunization with acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids to 3 months. \nInterleukin-2 induces early multisystem organ edema mediated by neutrophils. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), an agent known to activate neutrophils (PMN) with thromboxane (Tx)B2 release, produces pulmonary edema within 6 hours of intravenous infusion. This study tests the role of PMN in mediating the edema. Anesthetized rats received 10(6)U recombinant human IL-2 (n = 15) or vehicle (n = 14) as a constant intravenous infusion during a period of 1 hour. At this time there was leukopenia 3.63 +/- 0.43 (x10(3)/mm3) relative to vehicle-infused control rats 6.12 +/- 0.86 and a decline in PMN, 2.19 +/- 0.14 relative to control value of 3.33 +/- 0.05 (both p less than 0.05). After 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in the wet to dry weight (W/d) ratio, was present in the lungs (4.93 +/- 0.20 relative to control 4.06 +/- 0.10), heart (4.09 +/- 0.11 versus 3.76 +/- 0.08), liver (3.50 +/- 0.10 versus 3.18 +/- 0.10), and kidney (4.25 +/- 0.07 versus 4.00 +/- 0.07) (all p less than 0.05). There was increased lung permeability demonstrated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to control 460 +/- 90 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05). Interleukin-2 resulted in lung PMN sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma TxB2 levels to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL relative to control 481 +/- 93 pg/mL (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment of other rats (n = 8) with selective anti-rat neutrophil antiserum 18 hours before the experiment led to a peripheral PMN count 10% of baseline and prevented edema in the lungs (W/d ratio 4.20 +/- 0.16) and heart (3.67 +/- 0.07) (both p less than 0.05) but not liver or kidney. Protein in lung lavage was reduced to 760 +/- 220 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05). The protection afforded by leukopenia was associated with lack of PMN sequestration and prevention of the increase in plasma Tx levels (484 +/- 120 pg/mL, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the rapid induction of lung and heart edema with a 1-hour infusion of IL-2 in the rat is mediated, in large part, by activated PMNs. \nPrevalences of diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk factors in Hindu Indian subcommunities in Tanzania. OBJECTIVES--To seek differences in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and other coronary heart disease risk factors, and to identify factors associated with these differences within a Hindu Indian community. DESIGN--Population based cross sectional survey. SETTING--Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. SUBJECTS--Of 20 Hindu subcommunities categorised by caste in Dar-es-Salaam, seven were randomly selected. 1147 (76.7%) of 1495 subjects aged 15 or over participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood glucose concentrations (fasting and two hours after oral glucose loading), serum total cholesterol and serum triglyceride concentrations, blood pressure, and height and weight. RESULTS--The subcommunities differed substantially in socioeconomic characteristics and lifestyle. Overall, 9.8% of subjects (109/1113) had diabetes, 17.0% (189/1113) impaired glucose tolerance, 14.5% (166/1143) hypertension, and 13.3% (151/1138) were obese. The mean fasting blood glucose concentration was 4.9 mmol/l, the blood glucose concentration two hours after oral loading (75 g) 6.0 mmol/l, the total cholesterol concentration 4.9 mmol/l, the serum triglyceride concentration 1.4 mmol/l, and body mass index (weight/height: kg/m2) 24.3. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 121 and 77 mm Hg respectively. There were important intercommunity differences even after standardisation for age, sex, and body mass index--for example, in mean fasting blood glucose concentration (range 4.5 (Jains) to 5.9 mmol/l (Patels)), serum total cholesterol concentration (range 4.5 (Jains) to 6.2 mmol/l (Suthars)), systolic blood pressure (range 110 (Limbachias) to 127 mm Hg (Bhatias)), and prevalences of diabetes (range 3.4% (3/87 Limbachias) to 18% (20/111 Navnats)) and hypertension (range 5.7% (5/87 Limbachias) to 19.4% (43/222 Bhatias). Variables which showed significant linear correlation with subcommunity variations were entered into a multiple regression model. Intercommunity variations persisted. The Limbachia and Jain communities had the lowest prevalence of and mean values for coronary heart disease risk factors and the Bhatia and Patel communities had the highest. CONCLUSIONS--In this series intercommunity variations in disease and risk factors might have been related to genetic, dietary, socioeconomic, and lifestyle differences but could not be explained by the characteristics studied. Studies of Indian subcommunities are warranted to confirm and extend these descriptive findings and explore the genetic basis of diabetes. Communities of Indian origin should not be perceived as homogeneous. \nDiffering patterns of striatal 18F-dopa uptake in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we studied regional striatal 18F-dopa uptake in 16 patients with L-dopa-responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), 18 patients with multiple system atrophy, and 10 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. Results were compared with those of 30 age-matched normal volunteers. The patients with PD showed significantly reduced mean uptake of 18F-dopa in the caudate and putamen compared to controls, but while function in the posterior part of the putamen was severely impaired (45% of normal), function in the anterior part of the putamen and in the caudate was relatively spared (62% and 84% of normal). Mean 18F-dopa uptake in the posterior putamen was depressed to similar levels in all patients. Unlike patients with PD, the patients with progressive supranuclear palsy showed equally severe impairment of mean 18F-dopa uptake in the anterior and posterior putamen. Caudate 18F-dopa uptake was also significantly lower in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy than in patients with PD, being depressed to the same level as that in the putamen. Mean 18F-dopa uptake values in the anterior putamen and caudate in patients with multiple system atrophy lay between PD and progressive supranuclear palsy levels. Locomotor disability of individual patients with PD or multiple system atrophy correlated with decline in striatal 18F-dopa uptake, but this was not the case for the patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We conclude that patients with PD have selective nigral pathological features with relative preservation of the dopaminergic function in the anterior putamen and caudate, whereas there is progressively more extensive nigral involvement in multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. \nCommon complaints with cardiac implications in children. Chest pain, palpitations, and dizziness are not infrequent complaints in the office of a primary care physician. Historical events and physical findings can lead to a more accurate determination of cardiac causes of these symptoms. Electrocardiogram and chest radiographs are two additional tests most often helpful in determining cardiac causes of symptoms. \nTelangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma of the extremities. Results in 17 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seventeen patients with telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma (TOS) of the extremities were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, according to two different protocols. Preoperatively, the patients received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cisplatinum (CPD) (HD-MTX/CPD) and doxorubicin. CPD was delivered intraarterially, the other drugs intravenously. Limb-salvage surgery was performed in 12 instances, and five patients were treated with amputation. Postoperative chemotherapy was tailored according to the grade of chemotherapy-induced necrosis. In 13 cases (86%), the resultant grade of necrosis was greater than 90% (good responders). The mean follow-up interval was 3.5 years with a range of 18 to 78 months. Fourteen patients (82%) remained continuously disease-free, while three patients developed lung metastases. Two of these died because of uncontrolled disease, whereas the third patient is alive and disease-free after metastasectomy. No local recurrences were observed. These results are better than those observed in 215 contemporary cases of conventional osteosarcoma treated with the same protocols. This study confirms that TOS is not a uniformly lethal tumor as suggested by prior reports. By employing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a high percentage of patients with TOS can be cured, and in most of them, a limb-sparing surgery is possible and safe. \nSignificance of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on prostate needle biopsy. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is a putative premalignant change in the human prostate. Previously, the spatial association of PIN with invasive carcinoma has been described in the study of total prostatectomies. PIN is frequently recognized in prostate needle biopsy specimens in which no carcinoma is apparent. To further define the potential significance of PIN, we performed repeat ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy in 21 men who had PIN identified on prostate biopsy performed because of an abnormal finding on digital rectal examination. Twelve patients (57%) had carcinoma identified on their second procedure including all who had intermediate- and high-grade PIN on the initial procedure. Prostate-specific antigen correlated with PIN grade and carcinoma on the secondary procedure, although this did not achieve statistical significance. Men with PIN on prostate needle biopsy should undergo repeat sampling to exclude missed carcinoma. \nSmoking and hypertension: risk factors for carotid stenosis. The prevalence of smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus was assessed in 221 patients suffering from internal carotid stenosis and compared with the prevalences in two sex- and age-matched control groups composed of subjects having normal Doppler findings and from non-neurological outpatients. Of the subjects with carotid stenosis 27.6% were hypertensive smokers in comparison with 9.5% and 17.2% in the two control groups. The difference of the stenosis cohort from the two control groups was significant (P less than 0.01 and P = 0.016 respectively). There was no statistically significant differences between the occurrence of diabetes and hypertension in non-smokers and patients who smoked. In 394 investigated patients suffering from carotid stenosis or occlusion an obstruction index, based on the Doppler shift frequency, was calculated. This index was lowest in the normotentive non-smokers. It was only insignificantly higher in the hypertensive non-smokers but significantly so in the normotensive smokers. The index was highest in the hypertensive non-smokers. It was concluded that cigarette smoking, especially if associated with hypertension, is a determinant risk factor for carotid stenosis and occlusion. \nComplications of endoscopic sphincterotomy. A prospective series with emphasis on the increased risk associated with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and nondilated bile ducts. Mostly retrospective series with limited use of sphincter of Oddi manometry have indicated that early complications are more common when endoscopic sphincterotomy is performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction than for common duct stones. The current study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the frequency and type of complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction compared with endoscopic sphincterotomy performed for other conditions. Four hundred twenty-three patients underwent sphincterotomy for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (166), common duct stone(s) (163), tumor (60), and miscellaneous reasons (34). Patients were observed in the hospital for at least 24 hours after the procedure, and 30-day follow-up data were obtained. The overall complication rate was 6.9%, but complications were more frequent when sphincterotomy was performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction than for all other indications (10.8% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.009). Precut sphincterotomy was more frequently required in the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction group (21.1% vs. 11.7%, P = 0.009) but was no more likely to result in a complication (6.2%) than standard sphincterotomy. The risk of a complication was considerable for a small-diameter common bile duct (less than or equal to 5 mm), particularly when sphincterotomy was performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (37.5%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 1.7%, but the procedure-related mortality rate was believed to be 0.2%. It is concluded that endoscopic sphincterotomy for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is more hazardous than for other conditions, particularly when a small common bile duct is present. \nIntrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in hepatolithiasis: A frequently overlooked disease. Five cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were found among 101 cases of hepatolithiasis. There was no definite sign of cholangiocarcinoma in ERCP and image studies of four cases. The possibility of the existence of occult cholangiocarcinoma should be kept in mind, especially when unusual presentations, such as body weight loss, anemia, palpable abdominal mass, and intractable pain, appear. An intraoperative frozen-section examination should be considered under the following circumstances: (1) whitish nodular mass over liver, (2) mucinous substance within bile duct, and (3) enlarged, firm lymph nodes clustered along the hepatic arteries and/or celiac arteries. \nInjury to the pre-pubertal vas deferens. I. Histological analysis of pre-pubertal human vas. There is very little information in the literature on the development of the human vas deferens. Therefore, the age at which the pre- or para-pubertal vas deferens becomes large enough for a vasovasostomy to be technically feasible is unknown. To determine the age or degree of sexual maturity at which a microscopic vasovasostomy is technically feasible, we collected surgical or autopsy vasa from 34 young males over a three year period, and correlated vasal size to age and Tanner stage (degree of sexual maturity ranging from 1-childhood to 5-adult). The specimens were embedded and sectioned transversely in glycol methacrylate. Using image analysis, the total transverse area and diameter, and luminal area and diameter was determined for each specimen. Surprisingly, there was no change in vasal size from birth up through 11 years. From age 15 years and on, the vas was adult in size. The vas develops to adult size between Tanner stages 2 and 3. The average external and luminal diameters of pre-midpuberty specimens (Tanner stages 1 and 2) were 1.0 and 0.19 (mm.) and the diameters of post-midpuberty specimens were 2.1 and 0.43 (mm.), respectively. These results suggest that, in the event of a recognized iatrogenic injury to the vas deferens after midpuberty, a repair by a traditional microsurgical vasovasostomy is possible. If the vas is injured before midpuberty it may be technically difficult to repair by traditional microsurgical methods. \nFunctional, biochemical, and histopathologic consequences of high-dose interleukin-2 administration in rats. A variety of side effects have been reported with the use of interleukin-2 alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells in patients with disseminated neoplasms. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of high-dose interleukin-2 administration in normal rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with intravenous recombinant interleukin-2 (900,000 IU/kg/day) for 9 consecutive days. Animals were placed in individual metabolic cages, and arterial blood pressure, food intake, body weight, and urine output were monitored. On day 10, animals were killed by exsanguination, various tissues were harvested, and a variety of hematologic and chemical assays were performed. The results were compared with those of placebo-injected normal control and pair-fed groups. The interleukin-2-treated group exhibited anorexia, weight loss, hypotension, anemia, leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, hypercalcemia, azotemia, and a marked urinary concentration defect. Histologic examination of various tissues revealed widespread infiltration with mono-nuclear cells and eosinophils in most organs, especially in the lungs and liver of interleukin-2-treated animals. Other abnormalities included severe panlobular hepatitis, hepatocellular necrosis, and thymic involution. Renal involvement was mild and consisted of focal interstitial infiltration by mononuclear cells. According to these observations, administration of high-dose interleukin-2 in normal rats results in a score of significant functional, biochemical, and histologic abnormalities. \nFrequency of the hypercalcemia-leukocytosis syndrome in oral malignancies. There have been a number of reports over the last 15 years of patients with cancer who develop both leukocytosis and hypercalcemia, particularly in patients with cancers of the oral cavity. In this study, the authors report the frequency of hypercalcemia and leukocytosis in 225 patients with oral malignancies. Ten patients (4.4%) had hypercalcemia, 11 patients (4.9%) had leukocytosis, and five (2.2%) had both hypercalcemia and leukocytosis. The occurrence of these two distinct paraneoplastic syndromes in the same patients was greater than could have been expected from chance alone (chi-square = 45.8, P less than 0.0001). This study demonstrates that although hypercalcemia and leukocytosis are relatively uncommon in oral cancers, when they do occur they are frequently associated. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first report in which the frequency of the association hypercalcemia and leukocytosis is studied in detail in large numbers of patients with oral cancer. \nLack of correlation between P pulmonale and right atrial overload in chronic obstructive airways disease. The correlation between P pulmonale and right atrial overload in chronic lung disease was studied. Right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and cardiac output were measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter in nine patients with chronic lung disease and P pulmonale on the electrocardiogram (P wave amplitude of greater than or equal to 2.5 mm (0.25 mV) in leads II, III, and a VF. The results were compared with those in six patients with an atrial septal defect (left to right shunt greater than or equal to 50%) and six patients with pulmonary hypertension (mean pressure greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg without left sided heart disease). Right atrial volume and wall thickness were measured in 10 cases of P pulmonale among 1000 necropsy cases and compared with 141 normal hearts from the same series. The patients with P pulmonale did not show a significant increase in right atrial or pulmonary artery pressures. None of the patients with an atrial septal defect or pulmonary hypertension had P pulmonale on the electrocardiogram. In the necropsy cases of P pulmonale mean (1 SD) in right atrial volume (32 (12) ml) and wall thickness (1.5 (0.7) mm) were not significantly increased (40 (14) ml and 1.4 (0.5) mm in the normal hearts). There was a significant inverse relation between the presence of P pulmonale and the cardiothoracic ratio. In all the patients with P pulmonale chest x ray showed a low cardiothoracic ratio, a considerably depressed diaphragm, and a pendulous heart. This study showed no correlation between P pulmonale and right atrial overload in chronic lung disease. \nAlteration of whole-body protein kinetics according to severity of surgical trauma in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition. This study was conducted to clarify the mechanisms of body nitrogen losses according to the severity of surgical trauma. Thirteen male patients who underwent operation for esophageal cancer (group E), and 11 men (who underwent gastric or colorectal surgeries (group GC) were studied. The measurement of whole-body protein turnover, synthesis, and breakdown were made preoperatively on the 3rd and 10th postoperative day with constant infusion of [15N]glycine during isocaloric and isonitrogenous total parenteral nutrition. Significant increases in the rates of whole-body protein turnover (flux) and breakdown were seen in group E on the 3rd postoperative day (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively), whereas the increases were not significant in group GC. The rates of whole-body protein flux and breakdown were significantly greater in group E than group GC (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). The rate of protein synthesis significantly increased in group E (p less than 0.05), but did not alter or slightly decreased in group GC. The rates of whole-body protein flux and breakdown in group E were still significantly greater on the 10th postoperative day than preoperatively. It was concluded that unchanged or slightly decreased rates of whole-body protein synthesis with slightly increased breakdown were seen in the group of patients who underwent gastric or colorectal surgery, whereas synthesis increased significantly with a greater increase of breakdown in patients receiving severe surgical procedures, esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. \nBenefits of implantable defibrillators are overestimated by sudden death rates and better represented by the total arrhythmic death rate Benefits of the implantable defibrillator on survival were studied in 56 consecutive patients (concomitant coronary bypass or arrythmia surgery in 15) during an 8 year period between 1982 and 1990. During a follow-up period of 29 +/- 25 months, six patients had a sudden death and eight patients had a nonsudden cardiac death. Nonsudden cardiac deaths included three surgical deaths (death within 30 days after the surgery; two in patients without and one in a patient with concomitant cardiac surgery), one arrhythmia-related nonsudden death (death within 24 h after an arrhythmic event despite initial termination of the arrhythmia by the implantable defibrillators) and four nonarrhythmic cardiac deaths. The actuarial survival rate free of events at 1, 2 and 3 years was 96%, 96% and 92%, respectively, for sudden death, 91%, 91% and 87% for sudden death and surgical mortality and 89%, 89% and 85% for total arrhythmic death (sudden death, surgical mortality and arrhythmia-related nonsudden death). Thus, in patients treated with an implantable defibrillator, 1) the rate of sudden death is low (8% at 3 years); 2) 50% of nonsudden cardiac deaths are causally related to arrhythmia (surgical mortality or arrhythmia-related nonsudden death); 3) the total arrhythmic death rate is substantially higher than the sudden death rate; and 4) benefits of an implantable defibrillator are overestimated by reported sudden death and nonsudden cardiac death rates. The benefits may be better represented by the total arrhythmic death and nonarrhythmic cardiac death rates. \nStroke from other etiologies masquerading as migraine-stroke. There has been a recent increase in the number of studies dealing with migraine-stroke. I describe five patients in whom migraine-stroke was the clinical diagnosis but in whom the subsequent clinical events or autopsy showed a different mechanism for the cerebral infarction. Three patients had arterial dissection (one proven at autopsy), one had marantic endocarditis that had been missed on two echocardiograms (proven at autopsy), and one had generalized atherosclerosis and diabetes. These patients demonstrate that important and different etiologies may produce what seems to be the migraine-stroke syndrome. The result may be failure to recognize specific therapeutic measures that could have vitally important benefit to the patient. \nLow peptic ulcer and high gastric cancer prevalence in a developing country with a high prevalence of infection by Helicobacter pylori. We compared the prevalence rates of peptic ulcer (duodenal and gastric) and gastric cancer in 1,796 dyspeptic Peruvian patients with those reported in 2,883 similar patients from developed countries. The prevalence of total peptic ulcer was significantly lower, and that of gastric cancer significantly higher, in the Peruvian patients. The prevalence of gastric ulcer was lower but not significantly so. We deduced that the significantly lower prevalence of total peptic ulcer was directly related to the low prevalence rate of duodenal ulcer. We hypothesize that the reason for these differences was probably a higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic atrophic gastritis with hypochlorhydria in the Peruvian patients. Hypochlorhydria decreases the predisposition to peptic ulcer (especially duodenal ulcer), and chronic atrophic gastritis may predispose an individual to gastric cancer. \nClinical implications of late proven patency after successful coronary angioplasty. BACKGROUND. The introduction of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has changed the pattern of intervention in coronary artery disease. However, the long-term results in patients undergoing successful, elective, native-vessel PTCA are not yet fully characterized. Because the healing and subsequent proliferative response after angioplasty are time related, it was the purpose of the present study to determine the long-term outcome in patients whose dilated arteries have been demonstrated to be patent 4-12 months after successful, uncomplicated PTCA. METHODS AND RESULTS. The patients were grouped on the basis of the 4-12 month catheterization into those whose vessels were angiographically \"normal\" or had luminal irregularities only at the PTCA sites (396 patients), those whose vessels also had luminal irregularities elsewhere with or without PTCA site luminal irregularities (680 patients), and those with significant obstructive disease (more than 50% diameter narrowing) at sites other than the PTCA sites (426 patients). Of 1,502 such patients, long-term follow-up was available in 1,491. At the time of the original angioplasty, the normal patients had a 1.8% incidence of multivessel disease; luminal irregularity patients, 9.4%; and obstructive disease patients, 58.7%. At angiographic restudy, 16.4% of the obstructive disease patients continued to have multivessel disease. The patients were followed for the events of death, myocardial infarction, coronary surgery, and repeat PTCA. The 6-year survival rate was 95%; cardiac survival, 96%; and freedom from all events, 65%. The strongest correlate of events during follow-up was the angiographic status of the undilated segments. At 6 years, freedom from cardiac events was noted in 77% of the normal group, 61% of the luminal irregularity group, and 55% of the obstructive disease group. Diabetes and hypertension were also independent correlates of events. CONCLUSIONS. Results from the present study show that associated disease in undilated segments is a strong predictor of late events in patients after successful, uncomplicated, reatenosis-free PTCA. However, the need for further revascularization was frequent even in patients without obstructive disease. Completeness of revascularization is appropriate when possible, and limiting progression of coronary disease at sites remote from those dilated should improve on these late results. \nPressure therapy for the control of hypertrophic scar formation after burn injury. A history and review. Devastating functional problems can result from the formation of hypertrophic scar tissue after burn injury. Although a patient with burns may have several medical problems to contend with because of the injury, most ongoing rehabilitation difficulties are a consequence of the continual wound contraction that occurs in immature burn scars. Treatment of hypertrophic burn scar consists of several surgical options and of pressure therapy, which traditionally involves wearing garments made from elasticized fabric. This article reviews the treatment of hypertrophic scar tissue, with emphasis on its history and on nonsurgical methods of managing the burn scar. \nRepolarization inhomogeneities in ventricular myocardium change dynamically with abrupt cycle length shortening. BACKGROUND. In single heart cells, abrupt changes in stimulation rate elicit complex alterations in repolarization. The effects of rate change on dispersion of repolarization, however, have not been well characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS. To determine the effects of abrupt cycle length (CL) shortening on spatial inhomogeneity of repolarization in a syncytium of ventricular cells, 124 action potentials were simultaneously recorded from Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts using high-resolution optical mapping with voltage-sensitive dye. The distribution of ventricular action potential durations (APDs) mapped during each cardiac cycle was used to calculate mean APD and repolarization dispersion index (DI), defined as the variance of the distribution. After abruptly shortening CL from 500 to 300 msec, mean APD declined exponentially in normoxic controls (by 23 +/- 3 msec, p less than 0.0001). This response was characterized by beat-to-beat oscillations of APD that were synchronized at all ventricular sites. After 30 minutes of hypoxia, mean APD decreased from 175.0 +/- 13.3 to 76 +/- 25.7 msec. However, during hypoxia, abrupt CL shortening lowered mean APD by only an additional 6 +/- 6 msec, and APD oscillations were no longer synchronized throughout the ventricle. In controls, beat-to-beat DI decreased significantly (-51.0 +/- 6.8%, p less than 0.01) by the sixth post-CL shortening beat and then recovered (by 15-20 beats). In contrast, DI failed to decrease during hypoxia (+7.1 +/- 23%). Two mechanisms for the transient decline of DI in controls were identified: synchronous APD oscillations and transient diminution of the apical-to-basal ventricular APD gradient. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization, as measured by DI, changes dynamically with CL shortening. Furthermore, the hypoxic ventricle does not attenuate DI after abrupt CL shortening and thereby lacks a physiological response expected to diminish vulnerability to arrhythmias. \nPhysical activity on the job and cancer in Missouri. We conducted a series of case-control studies to investigate the risks of 16 cancer types in relation to occupational physical activity. These studies were based on Missouri Cancer Registry data for 17,147 White male cancer patients registered between 1984 and 1989. Colon cancer risk was increased for both the moderate (odds ratio (OR) = 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0, 1.3) and low (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.5) activity levels. Similar elevations were observed for prostate cancer at the moderate (OR = 1.1; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.3) and low (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.2, 1.8) levels of activity, and for cancer of the testis at the low activity level (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.3, 3.7). An opposite trend (p less than 0.01) was noted for lung cancer, which showed decreased risk at the moderate (OR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.8, 1.0) and low (OR = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.6, 0.9) activity levels. These associations suggest that further study of the relationship between physical activity and site-specific cancer risk is warranted. \nInteraction between free radicals and excitatory amino acids in the formation of ischemic brain edema in rats. Both oxygen free radicals and excitatory amino acids have been implicated as important cellular toxins in ischemic brain. Recent in vitro studies suggest that there may be a mutual interaction between these two mediators. We explored the relation between oxygen free radicals and excitatory amino acids in the development of ischemic brain edema in vivo. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with the free radical scavenger dimethylthiourea 1 hour before ischemia or with the excitotoxin antagonist MK-801 30 minutes before ischemia produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Groups of seven or eight animals were treated with vehicle, low-dose (375 mg/kg) dimethylthiourea, high-dose (750 mg/kg) dimethylthiourea, low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) MK-801, high-dose (2.0 mg/kg) MK-801, or both high-dose dimethylthiourea and low-dose MK-801. After 4 hours of ischemia, brain water content was determined. In eight vehicle-treated controls, mean +/- SEM water content of tissue in the center of the ischemic zone was 83.29 +/- 0.18%. A significant reduction of brain edema was observed in all drug-treated groups: for example, 50.2% (p less than 0.001) in the high-dose dimethylthiourea group, 53.7% (p less than 0.001) in the low-dose MK-801 group, and 66.4% (p less than 0.001) in the combined dimethylthiourea and MK-801 group. Combined treatment with dimethylthiourea and MK-801 provided no significant additive effect over that resulting from treatment with MK-801 alone. \nHeart transplantation in children: an international survey. A survey of cardiac transplantation in children provided data from 381 transplantations in 362 patients from 32 centers in the United States and ten international centers. The number of transplantations continues to increase, in part because of transplantations in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and patients with congenital defects. The immunosuppression regimens were more uniform than in the 1985 survey, and triple therapy was most common. Actuarial survival rates were 85% at 1 month, 72% at 1 year, 64% at 3 years, and 60% at 5 years. However, these improved rates are still not equal to the survival of the overall cardiac transplant population, in part because of lower survival rates in neonates. Ventricular dysfunction and rejection, rather than infection, were the leading causes of death. Rejection and infection were the most frequent complications. Also common were hypertension (39%) and seizures (25%), whereas coronary artery disease (8%) was unusual. Functional results were excellent in 85%, and only 7% were disabled. Questions concerning growth rates and many other aspects cannot yet be answered. However, it is apparent that cardiac transplantation in the pediatric population is a very worthwhile endeavor. \nA mathematical computer stimulation model for the development of colonic polyps and colon cancer. Currently known information about the development and progression of colon polyps and cancer is summarized and organized into a mathematical computer simulation model that successfully predicts the natural history of colon polyp and cancer development for an average patient with (1) familial polyposis coli (2) genetic susceptibility as measured by a positive family history, and (3) negative family history with a high fat diet. The mathematical model uses four distinct types of cells (normal, transformed, polypoid, and cancerous) and two kinetic processes (mutation and promotion). Arachidonic acid metabolites play a role in the model in the promotion of cancer from polyps, and account for that promotion through: (1) their effect on encouraging more polypoid cells in mitosis to move toward cancer; and (2) their immunosuppressive effect over time. The model also shows that one defect in allowing more cells to mutate to the transformed state is sufficient to account for the chain of events leading to the clinical sequelae of familial polyposis coli. A second genetic effect at another point in the process is unnecessary. The mechanism of action of Sulindac on colon polyps is explained by the model through inhibition of production of arachidonic acid metabolites, most notably prostaglandin E. \nAntibodies against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes: presence in alcoholic, non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects. Several studies have recently shown the presence of antibodies against acetaldehyde-modifications in the sera of alcoholic patients. To assess the specificity of this immune response, plasma immunoreactivity with proteins modified in vitro by acetaldehyde was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 97 alcoholic patients with varying degrees of alcoholic liver disease, in 35 patients with non-alcoholic liver diseases and in 33 control subjects who were social drinkers. All three groups showed some response against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes. The highest plasma reactivities were found in alcoholics, especially those with steatosis and alcoholic hepatitis. Plasma from patients with non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects also reacted with the acetaldehyde conjugates, but to a lesser extent than plasma from alcoholics. The reliability of these antibodies as markers of either alcohol abuse or alcoholic liver disease therefore appears to be low. However, further studies using more precisely modified proteins or elucidation of the classes of immunoglobulin involved in the immune response against the modified proteins may give clearer differences between the three groups. \nActivation of cardiac sympathetic afferents during coronary occlusion. Evidence for reflex activation of sympathetic nervous system during transmural myocardial ischemia in the dog. BACKGROUND. Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5%) and cardiac (58 +/- 15%) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6% and 8 +/- 7%, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathe",
