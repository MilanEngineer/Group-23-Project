        "text": "macokinetic and pharmacodynamic heterogeneity of calcium antagonists, it may be wise to keep in mind the subtypes as exemplified by the prototypes nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil and to extrapolate from one type to another with great caution. The increased understanding of the diversity among calcium antagonists as well as the pathophysiology of hypertension and other vascular diseases promises an exciting future for calcium antagonists in cardiovascular therapeutics. \nUniparental paternal disomy in a genetic cancer-predisposing syndrome The 11p15.5 region of human chromosome 11 seems to contain a locus or loci involved in congenital overgrowth anomalies as well as in the genesis of many tumours associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Given the unusual differential parental allele involvement in the different aetiological forms of BWS and the loss of maternal alleles in associated tumours, we have now used 11p15.5 markers to determine the parental origin of chromosome 11 in eight sporadic cases of BWS. Probands in three informative families had uniparental paternal disomy for region 11p15.5. Further, an overall greatly increased frequency of homozygosity for several 11p15.5 markers in 21 sporadic BWS patients suggests that isodisomy probably accounts for an even higher proportion of BWS sporadic cases. This demonstrates that uniparental paternal disomy can be associated with a genetic cancer-predisposing syndrome. \nHepatocellular and biliary expression of HLA antigens in primary biliary cirrhosis before and after ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. Recently, there have been reports that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy has a beneficial effect on liver function in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, information regarding the effects of UDCA therapy on hepatic histology remains insufficient. Aberrant expression of HLA antigens on hepatocytes is regarded important in the progression of hepatocellular damages mediated by cytotoxic T-cells in primary biliary cirrhosis. In this study, we examined immunohistochemically hepatocellular expression of HLA antigens on hepatocytes before and after UDCA therapy in four patients with asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis. Piecemeal necrosis, intralobular focal necrosis, and portal inflammation, as well as infiltration of activated T-lymphocytes and expression of HLA class I antigens on hepatocytes, disappeared, or diminished in parallel after the therapy. In two of four patients, expression of HLA-DR on some periportal hepatocytes before the therapy also disappeared after the therapy. These observations imply that UDCA therapy decreases the hepatocellular expression of HLA antigens and thereby reduces or abolishes T-cell-mediated hepatocellular necrosis in primary biliary cirrhosis. \nGenetic control of susceptibility to diethylnitrosamine and dimethylbenzanthracene carcinogenesis in rats. The susceptibility to cancer induction after a single dose of diethylnitrosamine in male rats and a single dose of dimethylbenzanthracene in female rats was examined in the grc- strain R16 and the grc+ strain ACP, both of which have the same major histocompatibility complex genes but differ in the grc region. No tumor-promoting regimens were used, and the animals were fed only laboratory chou. The R16 males developed liver cancer and the R16 females developed breast cancer, there also were malignancies in other organs in some animals. By contrast, the ACP males did not develop any malignancies, and the ACP females had a significantly lower prevalence of malignant tumors. Thus the susceptibility to cancer in these two strains of rats has a genetic basis associated with genes in the grc region, and is independent of the carcinogen used, the action of a promoter, and the sex of the animals. \nImmunohistochemical study of androgen receptors in metastatic prostate cancer. Comparison of receptor content and response to hormonal therapy. A longstanding goal has been to determine whether androgen receptor (AR) levels could be used to predict the clinical response of metastatic prostate cancer to androgen withdrawal therapy. A major limitation of previous studies was the use of homogenized tissue, which yields an average AR content for all cells. By AR immunohistochemical study using an antibody specific for AR the authors assessed nuclear AR content specifically in the malignant epithelial cells of prostate needle biopsy specimens of 17 patients with Stage D prostate cancer. The authors found that prostate cancer contains AR-positive and AR-negative malignant cells before androgen withdrawal therapy, but the percentage of AR-positive cells did not predict the time to tumor progression after therapy. There was no significant correlation between the percentage of AR-positive malignant cells and the time to tumor progression. When patients were divided into two groups based on the median time to progression, the percentage of AR-positive nuclei was not significantly different in poor responders versus good responders. When patients were divided into two groups based on the median percentage of receptor-positive nuclei, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the progression-free interval revealed no significant difference between the group of patients with AR-poor tumors and patients with AR-rich tumors. Potential explanations for these results are discussed. The authors conclude that the percentage of AR-positive nuclei is not a sufficient criterion to predict tumor behavior. \nReversal of alcohol dependence and tolerance by a single administration of flumazenil. Chronic exposure to ethanol is associated with the development of tolerance to the acute effects of ethanol and a withdrawal syndrome characterized by anxiety and seizure susceptibility. In the present study we examined the ability of flumazenil (Ro15-1788), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, to reverse neuronal and behavioral manifestations of ethanol tolerance and dependence. A single injection of flumazenil (10 mg/kg, 14 hr before withdrawal) to mice administered a liquid diet containing ethanol for 10 days, reduced seizure severity during withdrawal from ethanol. Acute tolerance to ethanol-induced hypothermia was not sensitive to flumazenil treatment, but tolerance and diazepam-induced cross-tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol were reversed by a single injection of flumazenil given 2 to 26 hr before evaluation of tolerance. At a biochemical level, the ability of benzodiazepine inverse agonists (e.g., Ro15-4513) to reduce the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-operated chloride channels may represent a neuronal manifestation of ethanol dependence (Buck and Harris, 1990). Flumazenil treatment of ethanol-dependent mice 14 hr before isolation of brain membrane vesicles partially reversed the augmentation of Ro15-4513 inhibition of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in vitro. These results demonstrate that brief occupation of benzodiazepine receptors by an antagonist may reset the cellular mechanisms responsible for the development of ethanol tolerance and dependence, and support the hypothesis that increased sensitivity to benzodiazepine inverse agonists is involved in the development of ethanol dependence. \nThree-dimensional upper airway computed tomography in obstructive sleep apnea. A prospective study in patients treated by uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. The success of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in treating obstructive sleep apnea varies considerably. Some of this variability may be accounted for by differences in the site of upper airway narrowing. To determine whether preoperative awake upper airway and soft tissue volumes predict the response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, preoperative awake computed tomograms (CT) of the upper airway were performed on 60 consecutive patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea. Tracings were made from the CT scans of upper airway, tongue, and soft palate. Computer software was used to determine the cross-sectional area and volume of the upper airway, tongue, and soft palate. Patients underwent overnight polysomnograms before and 3 months after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Tongue volume was larger (p less than 0.02) and both upper airway to tongue volume (p less than 0.0005) and oropharynx to soft palate volume ratios (p less than 0.01) were smaller in obese patients. A good response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty as defined by a postoperative apnea index of less than 5 apneas/h or a reduction in apnea index greater than or equal to 50% was seen in 50 patients (83%). Patients who had a good response had a smaller oropharyngeal cross-sectional area (p less than 0.01), a smaller upper airway volume (p less than 0.05), a smaller upper airway to tongue volume ratio (p less than 0.01), and a smaller oropharynx to soft palate volume ratio (p less than 0.05). Obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea have larger tongues and smaller upper airways relative to tongue and soft palate size. Patients with smaller upper airways, particularly relative to tongue and soft palate size, have a good response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. \nPET as a tool in the clinical evaluation of pituitary adenomas. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used in over 400 examinations in patients with pituitary adenoma. It was demonstrated that PET with carbon-11-methionine can give valuable complementary information in the diagnosis of this tumor due to PET's ability to adequately depict viable tumor tissue in contrast to fibrosis, cysts and necrosis. Furthermore, PET with dopamine D2 receptor ligands can characterize the degree of receptor binding and thus give information as to the prerequisites for dopamine agonist treatment. Most important is the very high sensitivity given by PET with carbon-11-methionine in the evaluation of treatment effects. It is concluded that when properly used PET can be fully justified in the clinical handling of patients with pituitary adenomas and other intracranial tumors. \nThe decline of mortality due to stroke: a competitive and deterministic perspective. Although stroke mortality has been declining since the first part of this century, the rate of decline increased sharply during the early 1970s. The basis for the fall in stroke mortality is often attributed to effective management of risk factors, particularly hypertension. However, some investigators have questioned whether risk factor reduction alone can adequately account for the magnitude of the recent decline in stroke mortality. When viewed from the perspective of competitive and deterministic mortality dynamics, the major force decreasing stroke mortality is the decreasing deterministic competitiveness of stroke and the increasing deterministic competitiveness of various malignant neoplasms and degenerative diseases as causes of mortality. These reciprocal trends are a natural consequence of the competitive deterministic mortality dynamics which describe these diseases in an environment that is becoming more conducive to human survival. The competitive nature of human mortality makes drawing etiopathogenic conclusions based upon single disease mortality data hazardous. \nChronic sialadenitis with psammoma bodies mimicking neoplasia in a fine-needle aspiration specimen from the submandibular gland. A 65-year-old woman with a submandibular gland nodule had a fine-needle aspiration specimen that contained groups of duct-type cells and a psammoma body, suggestive of adenocarcinoma. The resected gland showed chronic sialadenitis with sialolithiasis and psammoma bodies. In a series of 81 resected nonneoplastic submandibular glands from 72 patients, psammoma bodies, nonlaminated microcalcifications, or both were found in 46 (57%). They were located most commonly just outside of striated or intercalated ducts. When examining fine-needle aspiration specimens from the submandibular gland, it is important that one be aware that psammoma bodies may occur in normal, inflamed, irradiated, and neoplastic conditions. \nScrapie-associated prion protein accumulates in astrocytes during scrapie infection. In the course of scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by an unconventional agent, a normal cellular protein is converted to an abnormal form that copurifies with infectivity and aggregates to form deposits of amyloid. We have used immunocytochemistry and methods that enhance detection of amyloidogenic proteins to investigate the types of cells in the central nervous system which are involved in the formation of the abnormal scrapie-associated protein. We show that this protein accumulates in astrocytes prior to the cardinal neuropathological changes in scrapie--astrogliosis, vacuolation, neuron loss, and amyloid deposition. These findings implicate the astrocyte in the formation of the scrapie isoform of the prion protein and amyloid in scrapie and suggest that this cell type might also be involved in the replication of the scrapie agent. \nSolitary myeloma of the talus bone. Solitary myeloma can present as either extramedullary plasmacytoma or solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB). More than half of reported cases of SPB are localized to the spine. The rest include appendage long bones of the skeleton, pelvis, and skull. The first case of SPB (to the authors' knowledge) is reported involving the talus bone of the foot. Although approximately 50% of SPB patients progress to multiple myeloma in the first 3 years after diagnosis, aggressive local therapy is indicated because the median survival of patients with SPB is better than that for multiple myeloma. \nTraumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm: a case report. A case of traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (CCF) associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is reported. A 42-year-old man developed traumatic CCF after severe head trauma. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a direct CCF associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm at the C2 portion. Transarterial balloon embolization of the CCF caused severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. A CCF with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. However, balloon occlusion in such cases is contraindicated because of possible rupture of a pseudoaneurysm. Trapping or a direct surgical approach is the treatment of choice. \nFibroblast stimulation in schistosomiasis. XI. Purification to apparent homogeneity of fibroblast-stimulating factor-1, an acidic heparin-binding growth factor produced by schistosomal egg granulomas. Liver fibrosis is the most serious complication of infection with Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum and is responsible for severe morbidity and mortality in hundreds of thousands of patients in many Third World nations. The pathogenesis of this condition remains to be elucidated. We proposed that certain cytokines produced by cells that comprise the chronic granulomas that surround the helminth eggs within the liver initiate hepatic fibrogenesis. We now report our successful purification to apparent homogeneity of the egg granuloma-derived fibroblast mitogen. The high affinity of this factor for heparin (elutes from heparin-Sepharose with 1.5 M NaCl) facilitates its purification by a two-step procedure, and identifies the cytokine as a heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF). Furthermore, because it has an isoelectric point approximately equal to 6.2, it has one of the characteristics of a class 1 (acidic) HBGF. We immunized rabbits with the purified factor and observed that the resulting antibodies (IgG) detected the factor but not acidic fibroblast growth factor (the prototypic class 1 HBGF) either by dot-blot ELISA or neutralization of biologic activity. The granuloma product and fibroblast growth factor also differ in target-cell specificity and amino acid composition. On the basis of these distinctions, we have designated the granuloma-derived mitogen fibroblast-stimulating factor-1. With the availability of purified fibroblast-stimulating factor-1 and the future analysis of its amino acid sequence, its structural relationship to other mesenchymal growth factors can be determined. \nThe association between human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid status and the results of cytologic rescreening tests in young, sexually active women. We examined the utility of cytologic rescreening tests in women who had positive test results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid but who were diagnosed as having benign conditions at cytologic testing. One hundred twenty-five Papanicolaou smears from women who were screened for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid were sent routinely to a private laboratory for diagnoses. These slides were then reviewed independently by two pathologists who were blinded to the human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid results. The effects of cytologic rescreening in cases of both positive and negative human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid were assessed by calculating z scores. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was diagnosed in 40% by pathologist A and in 20% by pathologist B of the human papillomavirus-positive subjects compared with none diagnosed by the private cytology laboratory (z = 3.09, p less than 0.005 and z = 1.98, p less than 0.05, respectively). No significant differences were found in the human papillomavirus-negative group. We conclude that cytologic rescreening in human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid-positive women who were initially diagnosed as having benign cytologic results will yield a significant proportion of cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. \nRisks of untreated hypertension. A discussion [comment] There is a strong and graded association between blood pressure and the incidence of major coronary heart disease manifestations, congestive heart failure, stroke, and total mortality. The risk of any of these manifestations is also modified by other risk factors. Tobacco smoking affects the risk for all of the previously mentioned end points. Generally, lipid disturbances are only important predictors of coronary heart disease and total mortality. Several facts indicate that elevated blood pressure is causally related to the end points. There are, however, positive relations between blood pressure levels and heart rate, serum cholesterol level, body mass index, and, according to some studies, glucose intolerance. Some more basic abnormality may be responsible for the blood pressure increase and the increases in these other factors. Hypothetically, this abnormality may be more fundamentally related to some of the end points than is hypertension itself. If that is the case, then the type of antihypertensive treatment may be of decisive importance. Different end points may be affected differently by antihypertensive drugs, a factor that may be essential in the choice of drug treatment. Proper management of other risk factors is also essential in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. \nSympathetic neural responses to induced ventricular tachycardia. Although sympathetic mechanisms play a major role in buffering abrupt arterial pressure reductions, including those that occur during tachyarrhythmias, human sympathetic nervous system responses to ventricular tachycardia have not been measured. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded directly from the peroneal nerve in 16 patients during diagnostic induction of 19 episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (average rate 189 beats/min, range 130 to 250). Average systolic and diastolic pressures decreased from 149/78 to 61/49 mm Hg by 10 s and increased toward baseline levels to 88/64 mm Hg by 1 min of ventricular tachycardia. Average sympathetic nerve activity increased by 92% at 10 s in direct proportion to arterial pressure reductions and in inverse proportion to ventricular rate and remained 83% above baseline levels at 1 min. The late recovery of arterial pressure during ventricular tachycardia was related significantly to the magnitude of early sympathetic responses. Sympathetic activity tended to lose its discrete bursting pattern during ventricular tachycardia, and power spectral analysis showed that the large sympathetic peaks at the heart rate frequency present during sinus rhythm are absent during ventricular tachycardia. This study is the first to delineate human sympathetic nervous system responses to ventricular tachycardia. The results suggest that in the patients studied, large early sympathetic surges differed from those that occur during sinus rhythm and contributed to hemodynamic stability during ventricular tachycardia. \nIntermittent pneumatic compression versus coumadin. Prevention of deep vein thrombosis in lower-extremity total joint arthroplasty. One hundred forty-nine consecutive patients requiring lower extremity total joint arthroplasty were randomized to either coumadin (52 patients) or intermittent pneumatic compression (48 patients) as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Forty-nine patients were excluded. When fully ambulatory, the presence or absence of DVT was diagnosed by ascending venography (90% of patients), nuclear venography, venous dopplers, or impedence plethysmography. The two groups were similar in average age (64 years), indication for arthroplasty (pain because of arthritis in 90%), gender (98% male), and average number of risk factors (2.4). Twenty-five percent of patients on coumadin and 25% of patients on intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) developed DVT. IPC was more effective than coumadin following primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) (16% versus 24% incidence DVT); coumadin was more effective than IPC following primary total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) (19% versus 32% incidence of DVT). DVT developed in 36% of patients following revision arthroplasty. Seventy-five percent of all thrombi were proximal. Both IPC and coumadin were found to be safe; there was no increased perioperative bleeding in the coumadin group. Of three postoperative deaths, one was possibly due to pulmonary embolism (PE). \nMacrophage apolipoprotein synthesis and endoneurial distribution as a response to segmental demyelination. The synthesis and endoneurial distribution of apolipoproteins in response to myelin degradation was elucidated morphologically and biochemically in rodent models of segmental demyelination. At the onset of acute demyelination induced by tellurium (Te) poisoning, macrophages infiltrated the endoneurium and then began to express cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for apolipoprotein E (apo E). When demyelinating nerve slices were incubated with S35-methionine, radiolabeled apo E was released, showing that apo E was actively synthesized by the macrophages. Macrophages secreted apo E into the endoneurial spaces, leading to dense endoneurial accumulations. Other apolipoproteins (apo A1 and albumin) were not synthesized in the endoneurium, but they entered edematous nerves, presumably through an early breakdown in the blood-nerve barrier. During the phagocytosis of myelin, plasma-derived apolipoproteins accumulated within some of the macrophages. In chronic demyelination caused by lead poisoning, the cellular and extracellular distribution of apolipoproteins was similar to Te neuropathy; the amount of apo E accumulation and the macrophage density were proportional to the prevalence of active demyelination in teased fibers. Similar patterns of endoneurial apo E were present in an inherited form of demyelination in the twitcher mouse, after antibody-mediated demyelination, and in demyelination secondary to axonal degeneration. Human sural nerve biopsies had patterns of apolipoprotein E antigenicity that were comparable to the rodent models. We conclude that secretion of apo E by infiltrating macrophages is a generalized response to demyelination, and that endoneurial edema leads to the accumulation of certain plasma apolipoproteins within macrophages. These data suggest that endoneurial apolipoproteins and macrophages might mediate important functions in patients recovering from primary and secondary demyelination. \nCT, MRI, and autopsy findings in brain of a patient with MELAS. Brain autopsy findings in a 14-year-old patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes were compared with those of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pathologic examinations revealed extensive laminar necrosis bordered by gliotic tissues throughout the cerebral cortices. Moderate losses of myelin and fibrous gliosis were also observed in the subcortical and deep white matter. These lesions were demonstrated as low-density areas on CT and as high-signal areas on T2-weighted MRI. MRI revealed the lesions more distinctively and precisely than CT. Neither CT nor MRI could reveal abnormalities in the basal ganglia, including vascular proliferation and calcium deposits in the blood vessels. \nEffect of milacemide on audiogenic seizures and cortical (Na+, K+)-ATPase of DBA/2J mice. Milacemide (MLM, CP 1552 S, 2-N-pentylaminoacetamide), a glycinamide derivative, is currently being evaluated clinically for antiepileptic activity. Anticonvulsant properties have been shown in various animal models, but the mechanism of action of MLM is unclear. We studied its activity in audiogenic seizures of DBA/2J mice. MLM was effective in inhibiting the convulsions induced by sound with a biphasic dose-effect relation. The ED50 was 109 mg/kg orally against tonic extension. Higher doses were necessary to abolish clonic convulsion and running response. Because impaired cerebral (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity is supposed to play a role in epileptogenesis, we tested MLM on in vitro cortical enzymatic activity of DBA/2J mice. Basal (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity was unchanged by several concentrations of MLM in normal C57BL/6J and audiogenic DBA/2J mice. K+ activation (from 3 to 18 mM) of (Na+, K+)-ATPase is abolished in DBA/2J mice as compared with C57BL/6J mice, suggesting impaired glial (Na+, K+)-ATPase. In the presence of MLM (from 30 to 1000 mg/L), cortical (Na+, K+)-ATPase of DBA/2J mice is activated by high concentrations of K+, as in C57BL/6J mice. Results suggest that the antiepileptic activity of MLM in audiogenic mice may be secondary to an activation of a deficient glial (Na+, K+)-ATPase. \nCardiovascular effects of isradipine in essential hypertension. The immediate and short-term cardiovascular effects of oral isradipine therapy were evaluated in 11 patients with mild to moderate systemic hypertension. Isradipine, 5 mg administered orally, induced a significant reduction in arterial pressure from 165 +/- 6/88 +/- 3 mm Hg to 140 +/- 5/76 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) within 2.5 hours by a decrease in total peripheral resistance associated with an increase in heart rate and cardiac output. Contrary to the acute effect, oral therapy with isradipine for 3 months reduced arterial pressure through a decrease in total peripheral resistance but without causing an increase in heart rate or cardiac output or activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Isradipine slightly reduced left ventricular mass and improved cardiac systolic function and left ventricular filling. Renal blood flow increased, and renal vascular resistance (p less than 0.01) and total blood volume (p less than 0.002) decreased without a change in either sodium excretion or body weight. Thus, isradipine, when given for 3 months, decreased arterial pressure by reducing total peripheral resistance without activation of reflexive mechanisms. Its favorable effects on systemic hemodynamics, total blood volume, renal blood flow, and cardiac structure and function suggest isradipine to be an excellent choice for antihypertensive therapy. \nCorneal phaeohyphomycosis caused by Wangiella dermatitidis. A case is described of a corneal abscess of the left eye of a patient, male, 35 years, from which there was found in pure culture a mycotic micro-organism, Exophiala (Wangiella) dermatitidis, determined also in the native preparation from the pus. The patient is feeble-minded, suffers from von Recklinghausen's disease and has an impairment of the immune system (above all the reduction of T lymphocytes). \nEvents in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST): mortality in patients surviving open label titration but not randomized to double-blind therapy. The patient characteristics and outcomes were studied in the 318 patients who survived open label drug titration in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) and who were not randomized to double-blind therapy and in 942 patients, who were randomized to double-blind placebo therapy. The patients randomized to placebo therapy had a lower total mortality or resuscitated cardiac arrest rate (4% vs. 8.5%). However, at baseline, nonrandomized patients were dissimilar from patients randomized to placebo in the following ways: older; lower left ventricular ejection fraction; greater use of digitalis, diuretic drugs and antihypertensive agents; lesser use of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and more frequent prior cardiac problems, including runs of ventricular tachycardia and left bundle branch block. A matched comparison that took these inequities into account showed no significant differences in mortality or rate of resuscitation from cardiac arrest between nonrandomized patients and clinically equivalent patients randomized to placebo. Cox regression analysis indicated that two factors significantly increased the hazard ratio for arrhythmic death or resuscitated cardiac arrest in the nonrandomized patients: female gender (4.7, p less than 0.05) and electrocardiographic events (ventricular tachycardia, proarrhythmia, widened QRS complex, heart block, bradycardia) during open label titration (7.0, p less than 0.005). However, some potentially important differences between men and women were not included in the Cox regression model. Of the nonrandomized patients, approximately 70% were not randomized because of lack of suppression of ventricular premature depolarizations or adverse events, or both, and the remaining 30% because of patient or private physician request with no indication of another reason. \nInfluence of hypertension and dietary copper on indexes of copper status in rats. The Dahl salt-sensitive rat was used to investigate the effect of hypertension on indexes of copper status and to determine the extent to which dietary manipulation of copper attenuated, or exacerbated, the rate of sodium chloride-induced hypertension. Weanling salt-sensitive rats were fed, in a 2 x 3 factorial design, one of six diets that contained one of three levels of copper (2.0 micrograms/g marginal, 12 micrograms/g adequate, or 50 micrograms/g supplemental) and either control (0.4%) or high (4%) levels of sodium. Diets were fed to the rats for 11 weeks. Rats fed the high sodium diets were characterized by high plasma copper concentrations and ceruloplasmin activities compared with their respective control sodium rats. The magnitude of the sodium-induced rise in plasma copper and ceruloplasmin was affected by dietary copper intake; however, dietary copper intake had no effect on the development of hypertension in the high sodium groups. These results suggest that altered copper metabolism is secondary, rather than primary, to the development of sodium chloride-induced hypertension in the salt-sensitive rat. Red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity was reduced in rats fed the low copper diets compared with the adequate and supplemented copper groups. At the lower levels of copper intake, sodium chloride-induced hypertension increased red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity in a manner consistent with the plasma copper and ceruloplasmin changes observed. However, at adequate or supplemental levels of dietary copper, red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity plateaued, suggesting possible saturation of copper at sites of hematopoeisis. \nA new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia. A new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia is described, based upon the demonstration of a fall in the intramural pH of the small bowel after introduction of a test meal into the stomach. Intramural pH (pHI) is determined indirectly by tonometry, utilizing a tonometer passed per os. Postoperative assessment of revascularization procedures is also possible by the same technique. Application of the test in an 84-yr-old woman showed good correlation between a preoperative fall in jejunal intramural pH and abdominal pain, and the absence of a fall postoperatively after successful revascularization. \nIntestinal ischemia associated with cardio-pulmonary-bypass surgery: a life threatening complication. Intestinal ischemia following open heart surgery is rare but nevertheless extremely dangerous and the causes are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors influencing the occurrence and outcome of patients with this complication. At our institution between 1985 and 1989 1712 patients underwent open heart surgery and 4 female patients suffered from intestinal ischemia. The early mortality was 2.5% for the whole group and 100% for the group with intestinal ischemia. All these 4 patients were elderly and had a history of hypertension and hyperlipoproteinemia. Three of the four patients with intestinal ischemia had various risk factors for thromboembolic events such as pre-existing occlusive arterial disease and cardiac dysrhythmias or had a complicated postoperative course. In two patients an enormous increase in serum lactate to over 10 mmol/l occurred prior to the intestinal ischemia. We therefore consider advancing age, female gender and a susceptibility for thromboembolic events as important risk factors for the development of intestinal ischemia. A serum lactate over 10 mmol/l should lead to an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach including exploratory laparotomy. \nMitogenic effects of coagulation factor XII and factor XIIa on HepG2 cells. The structure of coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor), inferred from its DNA sequence, includes two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-homologous domains in its amino-terminal region. This suggests that factor XII may exhibit EGF-like activities. Reciprocal antigenic cross-reactivity between factor XII and EGF was shown by exposing purified human factor XII or mouse EGF to anti-mouse EGF or anti-human factor XII. Western blot analysis showed that anti-mouse EGF recognized intact factor XII at 80 kDa. Together, these results suggest that the EGF-homologous domains are accessible for anti-EGF binding in native factor XII. To determine whether factor XII has mitogenic activity, HepG2 or L cells (10(4) cells per well) were grown in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of factor XII or kaolin-activated factor XII (factor XIIa). Both factors XII and XIIa (6.0 micrograms/ml) enhanced cell proliferation by approximately 2-fold (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.005, respectively). In contrast, L cells, which are not EGF target cells, were not affected by either factor XII or factor XIIa. Various doses of factor XII enhanced cell proliferation, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and [3H]leucine incorporation in HepG2 cells cultured under the same conditions. These data indicate that factor XII, like EGF, is a mitogen for HepG2 cells and suggest a possible autocrine role in the liver. \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and complicated diverticular disease: a case-control study. Fifty patients with severe complications of diverticular disease were compared with two groups of 50 controls, matched for age and sex. The first control group (A) was randomly selected from all emergency hospital admissions, and the second group (B) from patients with uncomplicated diverticular disease. Of the 50 study patients, 24 (48 per cent) were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the time of admission compared with nine (18 per cent) of control group A and ten (20 per cent) of control group B. Both of these differences were statistically significant, indicating a strong association between the ingestion of NSAIDs and the development of severe complications of diverticular disease. \nStress testing in the period after infarction. Dipyridamole echocardiography is gaining popularity as an exercise-independent diagnostic method in patients with suspected or demonstrable coronary artery disease. To assess its safety, feasibility, and diagnostic accuracy in patients recovering from uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction, 131 patients had the test before hospital discharge. The results were compared with those of maximum treadmill testing. We found that dipyridamole-induced transient asynergy remote from the infarct zone was more sensitive (74% versus 53%, p less than 0.05) and specific (97% versus 68%, p less than 0.01) than treadmill testing for detecting multivessel coronary artery disease. In a subgroup of 42 patients treated with thrombolytic therapy, dipyridamole echocardiography was able to detect in 27 the presence of jeopardized but viable myocardium in the infarct zone. An excellent correlation was found between dipyridamole echocardiography responses and infarct vessel patency. Finally, the prognostic impact of dipyridamole echocardiography on patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction was assessed in a consecutive series of 151 patients. Eighteen months of event-free survival was significantly different in patients with positive versus negative dipyridamole echocardiography results (76.1% versus 50.8%, p less than 0.01). The test was also superior to treadmill testing in predicting cardiac events. Thus, dipyridamole echocardiography performed early after acute myocardial infarction is safe, feasible, and accurate for predicting the extent of coronary artery disease and 18-month clinical outcome. \nFluid resuscitation with deferoxamine prevents systemic burn-induced oxidant injury. We studied the effect of deferoxamine (DFO) infused after burns on hemodynamic stability as well as local and systemic inflammation and oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation. Eighteen anesthetized sheep were given a 40% of total body surface burn and fluid resuscitated to restore oxygen delivery (DO2) and filling pressures to baseline values. Animals were resuscitated with lactated Ringer's (LR) alone or LR plus 1,500 ml of a 5% hetastarch complexed with DFO (8 mg/ml). Animals were killed 6 hours postburn. The sheep resuscitated with LR and LR plus hetastarch demonstrated significant lung inflammation and significant increases in lung and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) from controls of 47 +/- 6 and 110 +/- 7 nMol/gm to 63 +/- 13 and 202 +/- 59 for LR and 67 +/- 4 and 211 +/- 9 for LR + hetastarch, respectively. The group resuscitated with hetastarch alone required 15% less fluid. VO2 returned to baseline values in both groups by 2 hours. Resuscitation with the 5% hetastarch-DFO decreased total fluids by 30% over LR and prevented the increase in lung and liver MDA. In addition, postburn VO2 increased by 25% above baseline values. Burn tissue edema, measured as protein-rich lymph flow, was significantly increased with the administration of DFO compared with the other groups. We conclude that DFO used for burn resuscitation prevents systemic lipid peroxidation and decreases the vascular leak in nonburn tissues while also increasing O2 utilization. Resuscitation with hetastarch-DFO may accentuate burn tissue edema, possibly by increased perfusion of burn tissue. \nPortal vein thrombosis complicating endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. Convincing further evidence. Portal vein thrombosis occurred in a patient who bled from gastric varices that developed after obliteration of esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy. This complication was recognized only at surgery when thrombectomy and endovenectomy preceded the successful placement of an end-to-side portocaval shunt. At histopathology, the presence of an amorphous, eosinophilic material staining negatively for fibrin and similar to sclerosant injected at sclerotherapy was observed within the clot. This latter finding, previously unreported, provides convincing evidence for the causal relationship of portal vein thrombosis to endoscopic sclerotherapy. \nDeterminants of genital human papillomavirus infection in young women Carcinoma of the cervix has several well-established epidemiologic risk factors, including multiple sexual partners and early age at first intercourse. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to have an etiologic role in the development of cervical neoplasia, but evidence linking HPV infection to known risk factors for cervical cancer has been inconsistent. The lack of expected correlations may be due to the inaccuracy of HPV assays previously used. A polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification method for the detection of HPV was used to investigate the determinants of genital HPV infection in a cross-sectional sample of 467 women attending a university health service. In contrast to studies using less accurate detection methods, the risk factors for HPV infection found here were consistent with those for cervical neoplasia. The risk of HPV infection was strongly and independently associated with increasing numbers of sexual partners in a lifetime, use of oral contraceptives, younger age, and black race. Age at first intercourse, smoking, and history of a prior sexually transmitted disease were correlated with, but not independently predictive of, HPV infection. These results demonstrate that the key risk factors for cervical carcinoma are strongly associated with genital HPV infection. This correlation suggests that HPV has an etiologic role in cervical neoplasia and reaffirms the sexual route of HPV transmission. \nThrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) phase II trial: outcome comparison of a \"conservative strategy\" in community versus tertiary hospitals. The TIMI Research Group In the conservative strategy arm of phase II of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trial, 1,461 patients were treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Coronary angiography, with angioplasty if feasible, was to be performed only for recurrent spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia. In this study results in patients treated by this strategy in community and tertiary hospitals are compared. Despite similar baseline findings in the two groups, coronary angiography was performed within 42 days in more patients (542 [48%] of 1,155) initially admitted to a tertiary hospital (on-site coronary angiography/angioplasty available) than in those (94 [32%] of 306) admitted to a community hospital (transfer to tertiary hospital for coronary angiography/angioplasty) (p less than 0.001). This different approach resulted in a greater use of coronary angioplasty (203 [18%] of 1,155 versus 32 [11%] of 306, p less than 0.01), coronary artery bypass surgery (133 [12%] of 1,155 versus 23 [8%] of 306, p less than 0.05) and blood transfusions (139 [12%] of 1,155 versus 17 [5.5%] of 306, p less than 0.001) in patients admitted to a tertiary than to a community hospital. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction or left ventricular function. These results demonstrate that a conservative strategy after treatment of acute myocardial infarction with rt-PA is applicable in the community hospital setting. \nPhysiologic adaptations to prolonged high-intensity exercise training in patients with coronary artery disease. Exercise training elicits numerous beneficial adaptations in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but until 10 yr ago these adaptations were generally believed to be peripheral adaptations rather than improvements in myocardial blood supply. However, animal models of CAD have been shown to elicit improvements in myocardial blood flow and left ventricular performance with prolonged, intense exercise training. More recently we have provided electrocardiographic, echocardiographic hemodynamic, and radionuclide evidence of central cardiovascular adaptations in patients with CAD after a year-long program of 1 h of exercise at 70-90% of VO2max 5 d.wk(-1). These training-induced adaptations are consistent with an improvement in myocardial oxygenation and concomitantly an enhanced left ventricular function in these patients. This program also resulted in improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and plasma lipoprotein-lipid profile. We have also shown that these beneficial cardiovascular and metabolic adaptations are maintained during six additional years of training in patients with CAD. These results do not imply that all patients with CAD should initiate such an intense training program, but rather that, in selected patients undergoing a training stimulus well in excess of that conventionally prescribed for coronary patients, the training-induced adaptations may be substantially greater than previously believed. \nLimb salvage surgery for bone and soft tissue sarcoma. A phase II pathologic study of preoperative intraarterial cisplatin. Preoperative therapy has been tested as part of limb salvage therapy for localized bone and soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities. The activity of cisplatin (CDDP) by intraarterial (IA) infusion was evaluated in 40 cases of which 36 were evaluable for response. All patients had high-grade sarcomas. All but 3 patients received 3 or 4 courses (24 patients received 4 courses) of CDDP at a dosage of 120 to 150 mg/m2 given over 6 hours every 2 weeks by IA infusion. Patients younger than 18 years of age received the higher dose of CDDP. Treatment was well tolerated with combination antiemetics. One patient experienced severe hearing loss with the first cycle of the higher CDDP dose. Pathologic evaluation of resected osteosarcoma showed a favorable response (90% or greater necrosis) in 8 of 20 evaluable cases and in 3 of 4 patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone (without osteoid). In soft tissue sarcomas, minimal (50% to 89%) necrosis was seen in two of nine cases and none had 90% or greater necrosis. Patients received postoperative chemotherapy based on pathologic response, but the value of this postoperative adjuvant therapy requires further follow-up and is uncertain in this small study. IA CDDP can often cause significant tumor necrosis in patients with bone sarcomas, whereas soft tissue sarcomas are less sensitive to this therapy. \nRoutine imaging studies for the posttreatment surveillance of breast and colorectal carcinoma. Current recommendations on follow-up procedures for patients who have been treated for cancer include imaging studies and other laboratory tests at relatively frequent intervals. At least two questions should be asked to evaluate the benefits of this practice for patients: Do frequent routine surveillance tests detect recurrences \"earlier\" in asymptomatic patients? and Does earlier treatment of these recurrences reduce morbidity or prolong survival? The practical import of surveillance with imaging and laboratory tests for recurrence in patients with cancer of the breast and colon is discussed. Reported autopsy data, findings at elective reoperation, and clinical data have been examined to ascertain the justification for routine periodic tests in the treated but asymptomatic patient. It is concluded that earlier detection of a local recurrence or of metastatic disease through periodic tests in the asymptomatic patient with breast or colon cancer rarely alters the treatment or the outcome. A notable exception is regular screening mammography following treatment for adenocarcinoma of the breast. \nA follow-up study of colonic epithelial proliferation as a biomarker ina Native-American family with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. A 7-year follow-up study of colonic mucosa proliferation markers was conducted on members of a Native-American family with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. Reproducibility of a tritiated thymidine autoradiography assay for labeling indexes during this 7-year biologically significant time frame was established. A good correlation between tritiated thymidine and a newer technique, bromodeoxyuridine immunoperoxidase staining, was seen. No confounding effect could be attributed to standard colon preparation. On average, both baseline and follow-up values for epithelial proliferation were within the accepted normal range. The presence of essentially normal labeling indexes among colon cancer patients and their high-risk offspring suggests the possibility of the significant effect of dietary factors in reducing proliferation. Such factors may account for the low risk of colon cancer that characterizes the Native-American population in the American Southwest. \nHigh-dose intramuscular triamcinolone in severe, chronic, life-threatening asthma [published erratum appears in N Engl J Med 1991 May 9;324(19):1380] BACKGROUND. Despite oral corticosteroid therapy, some patients with asthma have frequent exacerbations requiring emergency room visits, hospitalization, and occasionally, mechanical ventilation. We compared the effects of high-dose intramuscular triamcinolone with oral prednisone in patients with severe chronic asthma. METHODS. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study that spanned all seasons, we treated 12 patients with high-dose intramuscular triamcinolone (360 mg over the first three days of the treatment period) or low-dose oral prednisone (median dose, 12.5 mg per day throughout the period; range 0 to 30). The two three-month treatment periods were separated by a three-month washout period. During all periods the patients were allowed to take additional doses of prednisone for acute exacerbations of asthma. RESULTS. After receiving triamcinolone, the patients had significantly better peak expiratory flow rates than while receiving prednisone (the average [+/- SEM] weekly percent of the predicted value during the triamcinolone period was 91.5 +/- 6.9, as compared with 75.0 +/- 5.9 for the prednisone period; P less than 0.05). During the prednisone period there were 21 emergency room visits and 10 hospitalizations, but there were none during the triamcinolone period (P less than 0.05). There were two episodes of ventilatory failure during the prednisone period. Total steroid doses were significantly smaller during the triamcinolone period than during the prednisone period (P less than 0.04). Steroidal side effects were more pronounced after treatment with triamcinolone than after treatment with prednisone (P less than 0.1). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that high-dose intramuscular triamcinolone is more effective than low-dose prednisone in patients with severe, chronic, life-threatening asthma, but steroidal side effects are somewhat worse. \nEvaluation of biotinylated DNA probes for the detection of gene rearrangements in clinical specimens. To determine whether a nonisotopic procedure is suitable for analyzing clinical specimens for gene rearrangements, the authors hybridized DNA from 15 specimens of lymphoid tissue with biotinylated DNA probes directed to J beta I + J beta II (T-cell receptor beta chain gene), JH (immunoglobulin gene heavy chain J region), and J kappa (immunoglobulin gene kappa light chain J region). Five cases of benign lymphoid hyperplasia, one case of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, and one case of small noncleaved follicular center cell lymphoma had germline hybridization patterns when digested with Bam HI, Eco RI, and Hind III restriction endonucleases. Four cases of B-cell lymphoma and three cases of T-cell lymphoma had clearly detectable rearrangements of the genes for immunoglobulin or the T-cell receptor or both. One case of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy had a faint, clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor after digestion with Eco RI and Bam III. The authors conclude that biotinylated DNA probes can be useful for analyzing gene rearrangements in clinical specimens. \nAcute respiratory viral infections in ambulatory children of urban northeast Brazil. The morbidity of acute respiratory infections in young children and the role of respiratory viruses were evaluated in a 29-month household-based study in an impoverished urban population in Fortaleza, Brazil; subjects were 175 children less than 5 years of age in 63 families. Home visits were conducted three times weekly during which staff recorded the presence of respiratory and systemic symptoms and collected upper respiratory tract samples for viral isolation. A large and sustained burden of respiratory illness was observed, and respiratory viruses were isolated in 35% of the samples collected. Of the isolates, 45.6% were rhinoviruses, 16% parainfluenza viruses, 15.8% enteroviruses, 9.9% adenoviruses, 7.0% herpes simplex viruses, and 5.7% influenza viruses. The results indicate that poor children in northeast Brazil have a high prevalence of respiratory illness and that rhinovirus is the most frequent respiratory virus. \nPreoperative evaluation of gastric cancer by endoscopic ultrasound. The preoperative use of endoscopic ultrasound was evaluated in 74 patients with confirmed gastric cancer. It was used in diagnosing the depth of invasion in the gastric wall, the infiltration to the adjacent organs, and the involvement of the perigastric lymph nodes. Results were compared with histological findings in resected specimens. Accuracy in staging gastric cancer using the T grade of the 1987 TNM system was 81.1% (60 of 74 patients). Endoscopic ultrasound provided excellent results compared with computed tomography and conventional ultrasound, particularly in evaluating perigastric lymph node metastasis and direct infiltration to the adjacent organs. The success rate in detecting lymph node metastasis was 50% (11 of 22 patients); the accuracy in diagnosing direct infiltration to the adjacent organs was 60% (three of five patients). This technique is useful in diagnosing malignant invasion and lymph node metastasis of gastric carcinomas but requires further refinement for use in diagnosing the disease itself. Its preoperative use is recommended for establishing surgical and other treatment plans, as well as in predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer. \nEffects of endurance training on baroreflex sensitivity and blood pressure in borderline hypertension. Physical training offers a potential nonpharmacological strategy for control of mild and borderline hypertension, but its effect on blood pressure is controversial. We investigated the effects of endurance training on waking and sleeping blood pressure and on baroreflex sensitivity in 16 borderline hypertensive patients. First, 8 patients were assessed before and after a 6-month endurance training programme. Then, when it was clear that blood pressures were lower after training, a further 8 patients were studied not only at the end of the training programme but also after 4 months' abstention from exercise (detraining). Measurements were taken of baroreflex sensitivity (response to iv phenylephrine), blood pressure, R-R interval, and blood pressure and R-R variability. Ambulatory blood pressures were measured in 13 patients (7 trained, 6 detrained) and sleep blood pressures in 6 patients (3 trained, 3 detrained). Increased fitness was associated with a decline in resting arterial blood pressure of 9.7 (SE 2.0) mm Hg systolic and 6.8 (1.2) mm Hg diastolic, and with a decline in ambulatory blood pressure of 4.8 (1.4) mm Hg and 7.5 (2.1) mm Hg, respectively; both p less than 0.05. Baroreflex sensitivity was 14.0 (1.8) ms/mm Hg in the unfit and 17.5 (2.0) ms/mm Hg in the fit; p less than 0.05. Sleep blood pressures were not lower in the fit despite longer sleep R-R intervals. These findings indicate that, in some subjects with borderline or mild hypertension, a physical training programme is sufficient to bring the blood pressure within normal limits. \nThe long-term course of Lyme arthritis in children. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The natural history of Lyme disease is not completely known. We studied the long-term course of Lyme arthritis in 46 children in whom the onset of the disease occurred between 1976 and 1979 and who received no antibiotic therapy for at least the first four years of the illness. RESULTS. Of the 46 children (age range, 2 to 15 years), 33 (72 percent) initially had erythema migrans, 7 (15 percent) had influenza-like symptoms, and 6 (13 percent) had migratory joint pain. These manifestations were followed by brief attacks of arthritis, particularly affecting the knee. The percentage of children with recurrent episodes of arthritis declined each year. By year 4, only 10 children still had a mean of two episodes of arthritis per year; the duration of arthritis was generally longer in older children (P less than 0.05). During the sixth year of illness, two children (4 percent) had keratitis, and more than 10 years after the onset of disease, a subtle encephalopathy developed in two other children. Of the 39 children whom we were able to contact in 1988-1989, 12 (31 percent) still had occasional brief episodes of joint pain and 1 (3 percent) had marked fatigue. All 46 children had positive IgG antibody responses to Borrelia burgdorferi throughout the illness and on long-term follow-up. As compared with those who became asymptomatic, the children with recurrent symptoms more often had IgM responses to the spirochete and had significantly higher IgG titers (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. The course of initially untreated Lyme disease in children may include acute infection followed by attacks of arthritis and then by keratitis, subtle joint pain, or chronic encephalopathy. \nNeuroendocrine activation in congestive heart failure. Several changes in neuroendocrine activity follow failure of cardiac function to satisfy peripheral requirements and contribute to the clinical syndromes of heart failure. Afferent pathways are poorly understood and triggers are both central and peripheral, involving attenuation of atrial and arterial baroreceptor activity. Efferent sympathetic activity is generally increased with resulting vasoconstriction, but responses are organ-specific and differ among heart, kidney, lung and skeletal muscle. Changes in cardiac sympathetic activity are inadequately understood. Enhanced cardiac norepinephrine spillover contrasts with reduced tissue concentration and impaired activity of synthetic enzymes and neuronal catecholamine uptake. Beta-receptor down-regulation further complicates overall adrenergic responsiveness and the balance between enhancement of contractile function and reduction in arrhythmia threshold. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system is potentiated by the sympathetic nervous system and may contribute to vasoconstrictor hyporesponsiveness. Angiotensin II may in turn facilitate the central and peripheral effects of sympathetic activation and the release of vasopressin from the pituitary. Our understanding of the role of vasodilator peptides in heart failure remains rudimentary. It is likely that vasoconstrictor neuroendocrine response adversely influences optimal cardiac function in heart failure and may promote arrhythmogenesis. The neuroendocrine response in individual organs, however, requires intensive study. \nVipoma of the pancreas complicating ulcerative colitis. We report a case of vipoma of the pancreas in conjunction with ulcerative colitis in a 20-yr-old woman. Twenty months after the onset of ulcerative colitis, the patient complained of watery diarrhea and was found to have an electrolyte disorder. A pancreatic tumor was detected by ultrasonography and computed tomography, along with an elevation of serum vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The secretory diarrhea diminished dramatically, and the serum VIP level decreased into the normal range immediately after resection of the pancreatic tumor. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a pancreatic vipoma. Despite removal of the vipoma, she underwent restorative proctocolectomy and ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis 2 yr later due to progression of the ulcerative colitis. Postoperative course was uneventful, with excellent functional results. Knowledge of this rare condition accompanying ulcerative colitis may help in the management of the patient with an atypical clinical course. \nContribution of increased endolymphatic pressure to hearing loss in experimental hydrops. After the induction of experimental hydrops there follows a strict sequence of compound action potential (CAP) audiogram changes. Within days a low-frequency loss (below 8 kHz) is detected; within weeks a very high-frequency loss (above 8 kHz) develops; and finally within months the 8-kHz region is also affected. Following the application of excess pressure, presumably to the endolymphatic spaces, via a cannula placed in the endolymphatic duct, a sequence of CAP audiogram changes occurs that is not similar to that observed with hydrops. There is first a very high-frequency loss (above 4 kHz), then a very low-frequency loss (below 4 kHz), and finally the 4 kHz region is also affected and thresholds for all frequencies become even more raised. The data thus suggest that a slow accumulation of endolymph as induced by blockage of the endolymphatic duct does not produce the same disorder as a rapid onset of a high pressure applied at the base of the cochlea. In addition the data suggest that raised endolymphatic pressure is not likely to be significant in early stages of hydrops, but could contribute to the later high-frequency sensitivity losses. \nBilateral adrenal tumours in primary aldosteronism: localization of a unilateral aldosteronoma by dexamethasone suppression scan. In a patient with primary aldosteronism, in which the postural endocrine tests suggested the presence of an aldosteronoma rather than hyperplasia, bilateral adrenal tumours were found by computer tomography. Adrenal scintigraphy using 6-131I-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP59) during dexamethasone suppression showed early unilateral adrenal visualization on the left side. After removal of the left adrenal gland, which contained a 2 x 2 x 2 cm adenoma, the blood pressure and aldosterone levels returned to normal. A CT-scan, performed 1 year after the pre-operative CT-scan, showed no change in size of the right adrenal tumour, consistent with a non-functioning adenoma. In this patient, the NP59 scan adequately distinguished a non-functioning from an aldosterone-producing adrenal tumour. \nLong-term postoperative dysphagia in oral/pharyngeal surgery patients: subjects' perceptions vs. videofluoroscopic observations. Dysphagia commonly results from surgical resection of various structures within the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal areas. The type and severity of swallowing dysfunction are based largely on the number and quantity of structures removed as well as the reconstructive procedure. Short term-recovery has been addressed in many studies. However, follow-up studies of long-term functional results and continuing swallowing problems following oral/pharyngeal surgery are unavailable. In this study, perception of swallowing dysfunction was compared with actual videofluoroscopic findings in subjects at least 1 year after oral/pharyngeal surgery. The comparative results of a questionnaire developed to evaluate patients' perception of continuing swallowing difficulty and an analysis of actual videofluoroscopic tapes indicated that the degree or type of dysphagia could not be determined from patients' subjective descriptions of the swallowing problem. \nPartial atrial resection in advanced lung carcinoma with and without cardiopulmonary bypass. Combined pneumonectomy and partial resection of the left atrium was performed in 12 patients with advanced lung carcinoma (T3 and T4 in the new UICC classification). In the eight patients with a T3 lung carcinoma intrapericardial atrial resection with vascular clamping was carried out; four of the patients died within a year. The remaining four patients had a T4 tumour and underwent removal of the right lung and part of the left atrium under total cardiopulmonary bypass. One patient died shortly after the operation from cerebral and cerebellar infarction, and one died 11 months later from brain metastases. Two are alive and well. Complete resection appears to offer a chance for longer survival in patients with advanced lung carcinoma that extends directly into the intrapericardial pulmonary vessels or atrium. \nUse of electron microscopy in examination of faeces and rectal and jejunal biopsy specimens. The stools and rectal biopsy specimens of 44 patients with AIDS and diarrhoea were examined by culture, light microscopy, and electron microscopy. In 13 patients examination of rectal biopsy material and faecal samples showed no pathogen, but in two of these, microsporidiosis was found by electron microscopical examination of jejunal biopsy specimens. This organism was also identified electron microscopically in one of the further five jejunal biopsy samples taken from patients with a known cause of diarrhoea. Blastocystis hominis infection was identified electron microscopically in six patients, all of whom had cryptosporidiosis additionally seen by light microscopy. Four of these six patients remained well for long periods, with only moderate diarrhoea, and follow up showed no evidence of blastocystis infection. In only four of 11 patients found to have cryptosporidium in their stools at light microscopy were organisms found at electron microscopy. Viral inclusions were only identified at electron microscopy in one of 10 patients with an opportunistic viral infection seen at light microscopy (cytomegalovirus n = 7, herpes simplex virus n = 3). No additional viral pathogens were detected in either stools or rectal biopsy material by electron microscopy. It is concluded that routine electron microscopic examination of stool samples or rectal biopsy material taken from patients with AIDS and diarrhoea is unnecessary and does not increase the yield of potential pathogens compared with standard microbiological techniques and histology. \nMaxillofacial considerations in orthotopic liver transplantation. Orthotopic liver transplantation is now a widely used treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease. Lifelong pharmacologic immunosuppression renders these patients susceptible to many infections. The purpose of this article is to provide guidelines for treating the patient with end-stage liver disease, both before and after transplantation. In addition, we shall discuss some of the medical implications associated with end-stage liver disease and their clinical presentations and appropriate presurgical management. Adverse side effects of long-term immunosuppression and their effect on the oral and maxillofacial region shall also be discussed. Last, a brief discussion of FK506, the latest immunosuppressant, will be presented together with the implications of its use on our surgical treatment of these patients. \nClinical spectrum of bronchogenic cysts of the mediastinum and lung in the adult. Bronchogenic cysts are closed sacs considered to be the result of an abnormal budding of the respiratory system. They are lined by ciliated epithelium and have focal areas of hyaline cartilage, smooth muscle, and bronchial glands within their walls. They are seldom seen in the adult, and most are thought to be asymptomatic and free of complications. During a 20-year period, 86 patients underwent resection of a bronchogenic cyst of the mediastinum (66 patients) and lung (20 patients). There were 47 women and 39 men whose ages ranged from 16 to 69 years. Seventy-two percent of patients (67% with mediastinal cysts and 90% with cysts of the lung) were symptomatic at the time of operation, and the majority had two or more symptoms. Despite extensive investigations, which in some cases included computed tomographic scanning (n = 12) and angiography (n = 22), a positive diagnosis was never made preoperatively even if it was suspected in 57% of patients. In nearly all patients, the operative approach was that of a posterolateral thoracotomy. All but two mediastinal bronchogenic cysts could be locally excised, but all bronchogenic cysts of the lung required pulmonary resection (lobectomy, 13; limited resection, 6; pneumonectomy, 1). Major operative difficulties were encountered in 35 patients, all of whom were symptomatic preoperatively. Thirty-three patients had a complicated cyst; the complications consisted of fistulization (n = 16), ulcerations of the cyst wall (n = 13), hemorrhage (n = 2), infection without fistulization (n = 1), and secondary bronchial atresia (n = 1). Overall, 82% of patients had a bronchogenic cyst that was either symptomatic or complicated or both. \nMedical treatment of chronic otitis media: steroid or antibiotic with steroid ear-drops? The aim of this study was to evaluate whether, in the treatment of active non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media, the effectiveness of gentamicin with hydrocortisone ear-drops is due solely to the contained steroid or to the combination of antibiotic and steroid. Sixty-four patients presenting to the Ear, Nose and Throat outpatient department with active non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media were randomly allocated to receive either gentamicin with hydrocortisone ear-drops, or betamethasone ear-drops, for up to 4 weeks. Activity in the ear was assessed at 2 and 4 weeks. Gentamicin with hydrocortisone combination drops were significantly more effective than betamethasone drops (P less than 0.001) in producing inactivity of chronic otitis media, being effective in 80% as opposed to 29% of cases. The effectiveness of gentamicin with hydrocortisone ear-drops appears to be due to the combination of antibiotic and steroid. \nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy: evolution, early results, and impact on nonsurgical gallstone therapies Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a surgical technique first performed in France, has gained widespread acceptance among surgeons in the United States. The abdominal cavity is inflated by carbon dioxide, a video monitor is inserted via a laparoscope placed periumbilically, and the gallbladder is freed and removed from the liver bed by using small subcostal ports for access and dissection. Intraoperative cholangiography is routinely performed, but uncertainty exists about how best to manage choledocholithiasis. Compared with traditional cholecystectomy, initial reports describing laparoscopic cholecystectomy cite shorter recovery times because no large incisions are made, thus potentially reducing the cost and morbidity of cholecystectomy. A survey of 614 early cases supports these claims, with a reported complication rate of 1.5% and quick resumption of normal activities by patients. Because of its promise for reduced morbidity, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is challenging open cholecystectomy as the therapeutic gold standard for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thus, the standard to which the nonsurgical gallstone therapies, such as lithotripsy and contact dissolution, will be compared may shift to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As the laparoscopic complications are similar to those of traditional cholecystectomy, such as abscesses and bile leaks, their percutaneous treatment should not change. \nNecrotizing soft-tissue infections in the head and neck: a clinicopathological study. The clinicopathological aspects of 15 patients with necrotizing soft-tissue infections in the head and neck are reviewed. Our relatively large series suggests that the disease occurs more frequently than described in the literature. Histological studies showed that tissue superficial and deep to the fascia is frequently involved with the infectious inflammatory process, even in early stages of the disease. These pathologic changes were also found in healthy-appearing tissues at the periphery of the lesions. The early recognition of the disease and the prompt and aggressive surgical and medical therapeutic approach have resulted in far lower mortality rates (7%) than those reported in the literature. Frozen-section examination contributed to the maximal eradication of the pathologic process. This successful outcome was achieved in spite of the adverse associated clinical conditions, such as old age, debilitating disease, or complications, observed in half of the patients. \nProlonged gastric pH monitoring in responder and nonresponder duodenal ulcer patients: response to placebo and to H2-blocker administration. We evaluated the circadian pattern of gastric acidity by prolonged intraluminal pHmetry in 15 \"responder\" and 10 \"nonresponder\" duodenal ulcer patients after nocturnal administration of placebo, ranitidine, and famotidine. Acidity was measured during predefined periods under the different drug regimens in the two groups of subjects, and a comparison was performed both within and between groups. With placebo, significantly lower median 24-h pH values were detected in patients with resistant ulcer than in responders (1.13 versus 1.63). On the contrary, no statistical difference was detected between the two groups during any time of day after administration of either ranitidine or famotidine. Within each group, no significant difference was noted between the two different H2-blockers. Thus, our data suggest that patients with resistant duodenal ulcer display an increased gastric acidity in control conditions but a \"normal\" response to administration of antisecretory drugs. \nIdentification of FAP locus genes from chromosome 5q21. Recent studies suggest that one or more genes on chromosome 5q21 are important for the development of colorectal cancers, particularly those associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). To facilitate the identification of genes from this locus, a portion of the region that is tightly linked to FAP was cloned. Six contiguous stretches of sequence (contigs) containing approximately 5.5 Mb of DNA were isolated. Subclones from these contigs were used to identify and position six genes, all of which were expressed in normal colonic mucosa. Two of these genes (APC and MCC) are likely to contribute to colorectal tumorigenesis. The MCC gene had previously been identified by virtue of its mutation in human colorectal tumors. The APC gene was identified in a contig initiated from the MCC gene and was found to encode an unusually large protein. These two closely spaced genes encode proteins predicted to contain coiled-coil regions. Both genes were also expressed in a wide variety of tissues. Further studies of MCC and APC and their potential interaction should prove useful for understanding colorectal neoplasia. \nA summary index for the assessment of quality of life in angina pectoris. When exploring the effects of anti-anginal therapy on quality of life (QL), it is essential to use concise, reliable, outcome measures which focus on those aspects of the disease which are affected by the anginal pain, and which are expected to be responsive to medical intervention. Analysis based on a single comprehensive index is preferable to the use of several indexes as it avoids the potential for conflicting inferences from multiple comparisons. In this paper, we describe the development of a QL index which summarizes the three questionnaires used in the North Karelian Quality of Life (KarQuol) study. The summary index (SI) will be used to compare transdermal and oral nitrate therapy in patients with angina pectoris, and represents the first stage in the construction of a disease-specific evaluative index for future trials. \nMetabolic and functional recovery of ischemic human myocardium after coronary angioplasty Although revascularization of hypoperfused but metabolically active human myocardium improves segmental function, the temporal relations among restoration of blood flow, normalization of tissue metabolism and recovery of segmental function have not been determined. To examine the effects of coronary angioplasty on 13 asynergic vascular territories in 12 patients, positron emission tomography and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed before and within 72 h of revascularization. Ten patients underwent late echocardiography (67 +/- 19 days) and eight underwent a late positron emission tomographic study (68 +/- 19 days). The extent and severity of abnormalities of wall motion, perfusion and glucose metabolism were expressed as wall motion scores, perfusion defect scores and perfusion-metabolism mismatch scores. Angioplasty significantly increased mean stenosis cross-sectional area (from 0.95 +/- 0.9 to 2.7 +/- 1.4 mm2) and mean cross-sectional luminal diameter (from 0.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.9 +/- 0.5 mm) (both p less than 0.001). Perfusion defect scores in dependent vascular territories improved early after angioplasty (from 116 +/- 166 to 31 +/- 51, p less than 0.002) with no further improvement on the late follow-up study. The mean perfusion-metabolism mismatch score decreased from 159 +/- 175 to 65 +/- 117 early after angioplasty (p less than 0.01) and to 26 +/- 29 at late follow-up (p less than 0.001 vs. before angioplasty; p = NS vs. early after angioplasty). However, absolute rates of glucose utilization remained elevated early after revascularization, normalizing only at late follow-up. \nComprehensive multidisciplinary treatment of chronic pain: a follow-up study of treated and non-treated groups. There are relatively few outcome studies of multidisciplinary chronic pain programs which have utilized no-treatment comparison groups. The present study compared a group of chronic pain patients (N = 42) treated in a comprehensive multidisciplinary pain program with a group of patients (N = 15) who were evaluated but not treated. Comparisons were made at evaluation and at a follow-up period averaging 11 months later. From evaluation to discharge, the treated group showed significant increases in physical functioning. From evaluation to long-term follow-up, both the treated and non-treated groups showed significant decreases in self-report pain ratings and interference with activities ratings. However, only the treated group showed a significant decrease in addictive medication use and increase in work functioning. The return-to-work rate for the treated group was 48% with an additional 28% of the patients being returned to vocational rehabilitation. None of the non-treated group returned to work or vocational rehabilitation. Results are discussed in terms of their support for the conclusion that comprehensive multidisciplinary pain programs produce marked subjective and functional changes. \nThe place of isradipine in the treatment of hypertension. Isradipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of selectivity for the coronary, cerebral, and skeletal muscle vasculature. The drug has minimal depressant activity on sinoatrial node automaticity and negligible negative chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic actions. Isradipine reduces blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance without changes in cardiac output and stroke volume. Renal blood flow is maintained while renal vascular resistance is reduced; this is accompanied by both short- and long-term diuretic and natriuretic effects. Doses of 1.25 to 5 mg twice daily lowers blood pressure effectively over 24 h. In open as well as placebo-controlled trials, 2.5 to 10 mg isradipine twice daily was safe and well tolerated, and reduced systolic and diastolic values in up to 85% of patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Efficacy is similar to those of nifedipine and nitrendipine, and potentially superior to those of propranolol, atenolol, prazosin, hydrochlorothiazide, and diltiazem. The drug can be safely combined with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and diuretics. Adverse effects are dose-dependent and secondary to arterial vasodilatation, such as headache, flushing, ankle edema, dizziness, palpitations, and tachycardia. At the recommended dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, the total incidence of side effects does not differ from that with placebo. The antiatherosclerotic, antitrophic, and cerebroprotective effects seen in experimental animal models are promising for the drug in the treatment of human hypertension. Isradipine may not only reduce blood pressure, but may also reduce the risk for the consequences of this peril, namely, cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction. \nPerianal ulcer in disseminated histoplasmosis. A 65-year-old man with stage I testicular seminoma, treated with surgery and radiation, had fever of unknown origin, adrenal insufficiency, and an isolated perianal ulcer. Tissue diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis was established by biopsy of the perianal ulcer, an unusual cutaneous manifestation of the disease. Treatment with amphotericin B resulted in rapid clinical improvement and complete healing of the perianal ulcer. \nAdjuncts to thrombolysis for myocardial reperfusion. OBJECTIVE: To discuss adjunctive pharmacologic agents for acute myocardial infarction, to critique their initial effects in clinical trials, and to review their potential for improving the clinical conditions of patients with acute myocardial infarction. DATA SOURCES: Relevant studies reported from January 1985 to December 1990 were identified through a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature and through a manual search of the bibliographies of all identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Peer-reviewed experimental and clinical studies evaluating the role of pharmacologic adjuncts to thrombolytic therapy in experimental models of coronary occlusion and clinical trials of patients with acute myocardial infarction were selected for review. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The data presented were abstracted by the investigators. Differences with a univariate P value of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical data suggest that adjunctive pharmacologic therapy to thrombolytic agents should include aspirin, at least 160 mg administered as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms; intravenous heparin; and, in selected patients without contraindications, intravenous beta-blockading agents. \nDoes infant feeding method influence maternal postpartum weight loss? We conducted a retrospective study of 411 women to determine whether a significant relationship existed between method of infant feeding (breast vs bottle) and postpartum weight loss at 6 weeks and 12 months. In addition to method of infant feeding, the variables parity, gravidity, mode of delivery, maternal age, maternal prepregnancy weight, infant sex, and payment status (whether receiving assistance from the Aid to Dependent Children [ADC] program) were studied in terms of their association with weight loss. In general, no consistent relationship was found between method of infant feeding and postpartum weight loss. However, in the ADC group at 6 weeks and in the non-ADC group at 12 months, nonlactating women had lost more weight than had their lactating counterparts, in spite of the theoretical energy deficiency of breast-feeding women. Women who gained more weight during pregnancy consistently lost more weight following delivery, regardless of their prepregnancy weight. These results indicate that infant feeding method was not related to differences in postpartum weight loss between lactating and nonlactating counterparts. \nChildhood haemangiomas of the head and neck. Haemangiomas of the head and neck in children may be of several histological types, the clinical course depending on the group to which the haemangioma belongs. Treatment may be required if the haemangioma interferes with the airway, as in the subglottic group, or if the lesion becomes ulcerated with subsequent haemorrhage, as in capillary cavernous haemangiomas. Most haemangiomas require no immediate treatment as they involute spontaneously, though parental reassurance will be of paramount importance. Those lesions which persist may be amenable to treatment at a later date, the laser probably offering the best long-term results in terms of cosmesis as in the case of port-wine stains. Superselective embolization is becoming the treatment of choice for arterial haemangiomas. This paper is designed to clarify the histological and clinical features of these tumours and their management in view of considerable confusion in the literature encountered in our study. \nA public health approach to cholesterol. Confronting the 'TV-auto-supermarket society'. Coronary heart disease has been proved to be associated with a \"high-risk\" diet and with elevated blood cholesterol levels. The National Cholesterol Education Program has embarked on a campaign based on intensive medical treatment of 60 million Americans with high blood cholesterol levels, but the degree of benefit of dietary change or pharmaceutical intervention or both to reduce blood cholesterol values remains a subject of disagreement within the scientific community. Evidence from comparative international studies suggests that to lower coronary heart disease mortality substantially, dietary alterations and general societal changes must be greater than those possible under the National Cholesterol Education Program's approach of physician-centered patient counseling. The nation's priority to prevent coronary heart disease should be a public policy approach, the goal of which is to reduce for the entire population all coronary disease risk factors. In the dietary area, three proposals to reduce the availability of atherogenic foods are the use of warning labels on atherogenic foods, the prohibition of advertising for such high-risk foods, and the imposition of an excise tax on the same foods. We must confront the \"TV-auto-supermarket society\" that underlies our nation's high rate of coronary heart disease. \nScintillating scotomata associated with internal carotid artery dissection: report of three cases. We report three cases of cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection, which presented with visual symptoms resembling the migraine aura. When prolonged and especially when associated with other neurologic symptoms, such transient and positive visual phenomena can be manifestations of ICA dissection that mimic migraine. \nExpression of functional human Epstein-Barr virus/C3d receptor ([CR2] CD21) on insulinoma cell line. Induction of tumor rejection but not diabetes in syngeneic rats. We stably expressed human complement receptor 2 ([CR2] CD21 C3d/Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] receptor) on the rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F with a recombinant retroviral vector. CR2-expressing RINm5F cells secreted 78-33% less insulin than parental cells or cells transduced with an antisense vector and could be infected with high-titer EBV. We tested whether human CR2 expression on RINm5F cells would affect tumorigenesis after transplantation to syngeneic New England Deaconess Hospital rats. Non-CR2-expressing antisense-transduced RINm5F cells rapidly grew tumors and caused hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and the death of the animals after 15.7 +/- 0.7 days. CR2-expressing RINm5F cells were infiltrated by mononuclear cells at an early stage and eventually caused noninfiltrated tumors and the death of the animals after 33.0 +/- 0.4 days. These tumors were CR2- and are believed to have arisen from a minor CR2- population of tumor cells. The pancreatic islets were histologically normal at all time points. We conclude that expression of a xenoantigen on a rat insulinoma cell line induces an immune response in syngeneic rats but does not result in breakage of tolerance to parental or revertant cells. \nNausea and vomiting with use of a patient-controlled analgesia system. The incidence of nausea and vomiting following patient controlled analgesia and intramuscular morphine injections on demand was compared in a double-blind randomised study of 32 healthy patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy. There were no significant differences between the two groups in mean 24 hour postoperative morphine consumption, subjective experience of pain, nausea and sedation assessed by visual linear analogue scoring, and the postoperative requirements for antiemetic therapy. \nProphylaxis against venous thromboembolism in surgical patients. Venous thromboembolic disease is a common, potentially life-threatening, but preventable complication of surgery. Venographic studies have shown a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis in patients who do not receive prophylaxis. The long-term sequelae of deep vein thrombosis in these patients can be disabling, but the exact prevalence of post-thrombotic complications has not been well documented. Fatal pulmonary embolism has been reported in 0.5% to 1% of patients after major abdominal surgery and in 2% to 6% after total hip replacement. Several methods of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism have demonstrated efficacy, but a surprising number of patients still do not receive prophylaxis. A medical record review in 16 hospitals recently disclosed that only 32% of high-risk patients received prophylaxis, with a range from 9% in a community hospital to 56% in a major teaching hospital. The possible reasons for this comparatively low rate of utilization are discussed. Current issues and future trends in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism are briefly summarized. \nGeneration of a nested series of interstitial deletions in yeast artificial chromosomes carrying human DNA. We have generated a nested series of interstitial deletions in a fragment of human X chromosome-derived DNA cloned into a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vector. A yeast strain carrying the YAC was transformed with a linear recombination substrate containing at one end a sequence that is uniquely represented on the YAC and at the other end a truncated long interspersed repetitive element (LINE 1, or L1). Homologous recombination between the YAC and the input DNA resulted in a nested series of interstitial deletions, the largest of which was 500 kilobases. In combination with terminal deletions that can be generated through homologous recombination, the interstitial deletions are useful for mapping and studying gene structure-function relationships. \nProstate cancer screening in younger men: prostate-specific antigen and public awareness. The American Cancer Society recommends annual digital rectal examination for men over forty years of age. We evaluated 414 men between forty and fifty-nine years of age with a questionnaire, digital rectal examination (DRE), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determination. One hundred ninety were forty to forty-nine years old, and 224 were fifty to fifty-nine years old. Four patients in the forty to forty-nine age group had elevated PSA determinations, and 7 had abnormal findings on DRE. Using prostate ultrasound and biopsy, no cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed. Ten patients in the fifty to fifty-nine age group had elevated PSA determinations, and 5 were diagnosed to have prostate cancer. These data suggest that PSA may have utility in detecting cancer in younger men. \nChemical sympathectomy alters the development of hypertension in miniature swine. To determine if the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine could be used to chemically sympathectomize neonatal miniature swine, eight newborn swine were treated with 6-hydroxydopamine beginning on the first day after birth and continuing at regular intervals for the next 6 months. Six littermates served as controls and received vehicle injections. A significant reduction in the pressor response to intravenous tyramine (95%) and in the tissue norepinephrine content of the kidneys, left ventricle, and gastrocnemius muscle (more than 93%) provided evidence for an effective long-term sympathectomy in the 6-hydroxydopamine-treated animals. In addition, the blood pressure response of these young, chemically sympathectomized swine to chronic deoxycorticosterone acetate treatment was evaluated. Mean arterial pressure before deoxycorticosterone was similar in the 6-hydroxydopamine-treated (116 +/- 2 mm Hg) and control (125 +/- 5 mm Hg) groups. One week after deoxycorticosterone, mean arterial pressure had risen significantly by 20-22 mm Hg in both groups. Blood pressure continued to increase in the control group, reaching a value of 163 +/- 6 mm Hg by the third week after treatment. In contrast, mean arterial pressure in the 6-hydroxydopamine group did not increase further during weeks 2 and 3 after deoxycorticosterone. In conclusion, chronic treatment of neonatal swine with 6-hydroxydopamine produced an animal model with an effective, general, peripheral sympathectomy. The significant attenuation of the hypertensive response in these sympathectomized animals lends further support to the hypothesis that an intact sympathetic nervous system is necessary for the full expression of deoxycorticosterone hypertension in miniature swine. \nThe epidermal basement membrane in basal cell carcinoma: an immunohistochemical study. An immunohistochemical study of basal cell carcinomas of varying histological type, using a panel of antibodies to constituents of the epidermal basement membrane, showed marked deficiencies in the expression of the antigens identified by the antibodies LH7.2, GB3 and G71. There was no correlation between loss of immunoreactivity to these antibodies and the histological features of the tumour. \nVitamin K therapy in severe liver disease. A middle-aged man with parenchymatous liver disease and a decrease in vitamin K-dependent factors was given large doses of intravenous phylloquinone (10 mg/d for 20 days) without improvement in the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent factors. During subsequent liver transplantation, he exsanguinated. Although the exact role of over treatment with phylloquinone in this case is unclear, plasma levels of phylloquinone 300 times normal were attained after 5 days of treatment without effect on factors II, VII, IX, and X. Further therapy with vitamin K was unnecessary. \nPrimary cutaneous mucormycosis in a healthy young girl. Report of a case caused by Mucor hiemalis Wehmer. We report an unusual case of primary cutaneous mucormycosis caused by Mucor hiemalis Wehmer that occurred in a healthy young girl after an insect bite. The patient had a slowly extending, indurated, erythematous, and scaling eruption on the right cheek. Histologic examination revealed granulomatous dermatitis and characteristic broad, nonseptate, pale-staining hyphae. This is the first report of an infection in a human being caused by Mucor hiemalis Wehmer. The infection was cured with intravenous amphotericin B. \nSerum lipid and apolipoprotein levels in non-hypertensive lean NIDDM patients. To determine the possible role of a glycaemic control in lipid metabolism in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients, serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels were measured in well-controlled and poorly controlled lean NIDDM without proteinuria and hypertension. A sample of 96 lean NIDDM patients (body mass index less than 25 kg m-2 in men and less than 27 kg m-2 in women) were divided into two groups: group I, where the HbA1c concentration had been less than 6% for the previous 3 months, and group II, where the HbA1c concentration had been greater than 8% for the previous 3 months. Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol levels showed no significant differences between groups I and II. Furthermore, serum levels of apolipoproteins AI, AII, B, CII, CIII, and E did not differ significantly between groups I and II. These results suggest that glycaemic control did not influence lipid metabolism in lean NIDDM patients. \nRegional esophageal distribution and clearance of refluxed gastric acid. Regional differences in the esophageal distribution and clearance of refluxed gastric acid was studied in seven asymptomatic volunteers and seven patients with reflux esophagitis. Intraluminal pH was recorded for 3 postprandial hours from the distal, middle, and proximal esophagus on two separate occasions (with subjects in upright and supine positions). With the subjects in a supine position, about half of the acid reflux episodes reached the proximal esophagus in patients as well as in controls. This percentage decreased to 25% in patients and 29% in controls when they were upright. In both groups, the pH drops in the distal esophagus were significantly greater than in the proximal esophagus for both the supine and upright positions. In both patients and controls, a 4-5-fold greater acid exposure occurred in the distal esophagus, than in the proximal esophagus. In both patient and control groups, acid exposure time, as well as the number of reflux episodes in the distal esophagus, were significantly greater than that of the proximal esophagus (P less than 0.05). Spontaneous acid clearance time in the distal esophagus was significantly longer than that of the proximal esophagus in both positions (P less than 0.05) for both subject groups. In conclusion, regional differences exist in the exposure of the esophageal mucosa to refluxed gastric acid. These regional differences are more pronounced when subjects are upright than supine. Regional differences also exist in esophageal acid clearance, with clearance taking longer in the distal esophagus than in the proximal esophagus. The net effect of these phenomena is that acid exposure time in the distal esophagus is greater than that in the remainder of the esophagus. \nBilateral cerebellopontine angle tumors in neurofibromatosis type 2. In a series of over 500 cases of cerebellopontine angle tumors, 19 patients had bilateral neurinomas. Four of these tumors arose from the facial rather than the acoustic nerve. A conservative policy regarding surgery had been adopted in an effort to prevent hearing loss for as long as possible. Nevertheless, all patients operated on in this series are now totally deaf. The results of managing these patients surgically and conservatively are discussed. \nCongenital biliary cysts in Indian adults. Only one report of congenital biliary cysts has been described so far from India, and that was in children. We present our experience with 22 adult Indian patients with this condition. The main presenting symptoms were abdominal pain, icterus, and fever, and the classical triad of jaundice, pain, and abdominal mass was seen in only one patient. The mean age of presentation was 25.5 +/- 10.1 yr, and females predominated (82%). Type Ia cysts (fusiform choledochal cyst) were the commonest. Intrahepatic cysts were seen in four patients; three of these were associated with extrahepatic biliary ductal cysts (type IVa). Internal drainage procedures performed elsewhere in six patients were followed by recurrent cholangitis, necessitating excision of the cyst. Hence, the preferred operation for congenital biliary cysts is cyst excision and hepaticojejunostomy. \nPost cricoid lymphangioma. A 69-year-old female patient presented with symptoms characteristic of globus pharyngeus and barium swallow examination was normal. Her symptoms persisted and pharyngoscopy was undertaken; a post-cricoid polyp was found and removed. Histological examination revealed this to be a lymphangioma. Histological appearances, pathogenesis and treatment are discussed. The case illustrates that persisting symptoms presenting as globus pharyngeus should be further investigated to exclude rare lesions. \nHemodynamic consequences of desmopressin administration after cardiop",
