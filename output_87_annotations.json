        "text": "ion remained the same as the initial concentration in the red cells, whereas ATP levels had decreased to 61 percent of the initial value. The 2,3 DPG concentration was 62 percent of normal on Day 7 and 21 percent on Day 14. Glucose consumption, lactate production, potassium leakage from red cells, and pH levels were similar to those found after storage in DEHP-plasticized containers under the same conditions. After 42 days, hemolysis levels were 0.56 +/- 0.21 percent and 0.42 +/- 0.17 percent in two series of units mixed weekly and 0.70 +/- 0.27 percent in units stored unmixed. Although even higher levels of hemolysis were observed in the units stored unmixed and used for 24-hour posttransfusion survival, the autologous red cell recovery results were excellent (83.2 +/- 5.1%, n = 8). BTHC-plasticized PVC is found to be a suitable material for 42-day storage of red cells in SAGM solution. \nIntracanalicular acoustic neurinomas. The cases of 16 patients with acoustic neurinomas confined to the intracanalicular area are presented. These represent 2.7% of the 600 patients with acoustic neurinomas consecutively operated upon at the Neurosurgical Clinic at Nordstadt Hospital during the last 8 years. The comparatively earlier onset of vestibular symptoms and signs was characteristic of this group and precipitated diagnosis. The diagnostic reliability of magnetic resonance imaging was at least equivalent to that of air computed tomographic cisternography. Complete tumor removal was accomplished via the suboccipital approach in all patients, with 100% preservation of facial nerve and facial function; the cochlear nerve was preserved anatomically in 100% of the patients and functionally in 57%. No recurrence has occurred during follow-up periods of up to 8 years in all 16 patients. A broad spectrum of the current literature is considered, and purely intracanalicular acoustic neurinomas are discussed with regard to clinical characteristics, diagnostic steps-including neuroradiological and neurophysiological approaches-and surgical treatment and results. \nImprovement of spontaneous pregnancy rate after stopping gonadotropin therapy for anovulatory infertility. In a prospective study, 140 patients with infertility because of ovulatory factors (group A) were followed up for 6 months after failure to achieve pregnancy using human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) therapy. They included cases of oligomenorrhea, polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea. They were treated with hMG alone or in combination with clomiphene citrate or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist analog. The control group (B) included 83 infertile patients because of similar ovulatory factors. They were followed up for 6 months not preceded by ovulation induction. The overall pregnancy rate (PR) in group A (20.7%) was significantly higher than group B (7.2%). The PR was significantly higher in oligomenorrhea and PCOD patients when compared with the control group. There was no significant difference in the hypogonadotropic group. \nAdjuvant brachytherapy for treatment of chest wall sarcomas. Thirty patients treated with surgical resection and brachytherapy for chest wall sarcoma at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1980 through 1987 were reviewed. Patients selected to receive adjuvant irradiation were those for whom there was doubt as to the completeness of surgical resection. Overall 5-year survival and locoregional control after brachytherapy were 65% and 54%, respectively. Locoregional control was similar for tumors treated at initial diagnosis (12 patients), at the time of recurrence (13 patients), or for tumors that were metastatic to the chest wall (five patients). Six patients with tumors larger than 10 cm in maximum dimension had a locoregional recurrence rate of 69% versus a recurrence rate of 39% for 18 patients with smaller tumors (p = 0.27). Fifty-four percent of high-grade tumors recurred locoregionally versus 28% of low-grade tumors (p = 0.37). Bone invasion or the presence of positive resection margins was not clearly associated with a higher locoregional failure rate. Only one patient (1/28; 7%) was known to have had recurrence within the irradiated area. Eight patients (8/28; 37%) had recurrence adjacent to the implanted area, and the precise failure site could not be determined for the remaining two patients. Because of the relatively high risk of regional versus in-field recurrence, patients with chest wall sarcoma who receive adjuvant treatment should be treated primarily with external-beam irradiation to allow more generous coverage of the tumor bed. Brachytherapy could be used as a tumor bed \"boost\" treatment. In patients undergoing resection of recurrent tumor in a previously irradiated site, adjuvant brachytherapy, without external-beam irradiation, should be considered to reduce the risk of extensive soft tissue necrosis. \nEvaluation of three oral dosages of ondansetron in the prevention of nausea and emesis associated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin chemotherapy. We assessed the antiemetic efficacy and safety of three different oral doses of ondansetron (GR 38032F), a novel serotonin type-3 receptor antagonist, in three consecutive series of 20 breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for the first time. Patients received oral doses of 8 mg, 4 mg, or 1 mg of ondansetron three times daily for 2 days, with the first dose given 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamide infusion. We then evaluated the efficacy of a conventional antiemetic regimen of intravenous lorazepam, metoclopramide, and diphenhydramine given before chemotherapy and 10 mg prochlorperazine given orally twice on study day 1 and three times on study day 2 in a fourth series of 20 patients with comparable characteristics. The number of emetic episodes, assessment of nausea and appetite, and adverse events were recorded throughout the 2-day study period. Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical laboratory data were also collected. No emesis was observed during the 2-day study period in 17 (85%), 13 (65%), and 11 (55%) patients treated with 8-mg, 4-mg, and 1-mg ondansetron doses, respectively, and in seven (35%) patients who received conventional therapy. The incidence and intensity of nausea were lower with increasing doses of ondansetron and were lower than in the conventional group. Ondansetron-related side effects were generally mild and reversible and did not appear to increase in a dose-dependent manner. These effects included headache, stomach cramps, diarrhea, fatigue, and elevated serum transaminase concentrations. One patient who received three 1 mg doses of ondansetron experienced tremors and muscle twitching. Oral ondansetron is an effective and safe antiemetic for patients receiving noncisplatin cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, and its antiemetic activity appears to be dose-related. \nMyocardial infarction due to intracoronary thrombi without significant coronary artery disease in systemic lupus erythematosus. Acute myocardial infarction is a potentially fatal complication of SLE. Reported mechanisms include atherosclerosis, arteritis and coronary arterial spasm. The following case report presents a fourth possible cause; intracoronary thrombus with angiographically normal coronary arteries in a patient with active lupus and AMI. \nPercutaneous balloon pericardial window for patients with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade. We performed percutaneous balloon pericardial window (PBPW) in 8 patients (age 40 to 70 yrs; 4 men, 4 women) with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade. Pericardial window was indicated because they continued to drain greater than 100 ml/day of pericardial fluid through the pigtail catheter for greater than or equal to 3 days. A 0.038 inch guidewire was advanced through the pigtail catheter into the pericardial space and then the catheter was removed. A 20 mm diameter, 3 cm long balloon dilating catheter was advanced to straddle the parietal pericardium. Manual inflations were performed until the waist produced by the pericardium disappeared. All patients tolerated the procedure well with minimal discomfort and with no complications. A left or bilateral pleural effusion occurred in all patients after PBPW. No patient developed recurrent pericardial tamponade at a mean follow-up of 6 +/- 2 months. Thus, PBPW is a useful and safe technique to avoid surgery in patients with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade. \nMedullary arteries in aging and dementia. We examined sclerotic changes of the medullary arteries in 110 nonneuropsychiatric patients ranging in age from the second to the ninth decades, in 20 patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Binswanger's disease), and in 20 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type. The principal sclerotic change was fibrohyaline thickening of the wall, which began to appear during the late fourth decade, increased in incidence gradually with age, and was most severe in patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. Morphometry showed that the sclerotic changes of the medullary arteries were most prominent in the frontal lobe, followed by the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, in both the nonneuropsychiatric and demented groups. The sclerotic rate in the frontal lobe of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type was slightly higher than that in the nonneuropsychiatric patients (p less than 0.05) but far less than that in the patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (p less than 0.001). The sclerotic rate correlated well with the degree of ischemic white matter changes as well as with blood pressure. \nSerum cholesterol and mortality among Japanese-American men. The Honolulu (Hawaii) Heart Program. Hawaiian men of Japanese ancestry followed up for 18 or more years after a baseline examination showed a quadratic distribution of death rates at different levels of serum cholesterol. Mortality from cancer progressively decreased and mortality from coronary heart disease progressively increased with rising levels of serum cholesterol. There was a positive association between baseline serum cholesterol levels and deaths from coronary heart disease at 0 to 6 years, 7 to 12 years, and 13 years and longer after examination. The inverse relationship between cancer and serum cholesterol levels was stronger in the first 6 years than in the next 6 years and, although still inverse, lost statistical significance after 13 years. Cancers of the colon and lung showed the strongest association with low baseline serum cholesterol levels, while gastric or rectal cancer failed to show this association. Organ specificity and persistence of the inverse association beyond 6 years suggest that the nutritional demands of cancers may not entirely explain the inverse association with some cancers. The quadratic distribution of deaths in this cohort remained after coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer were removed from the analysis. For the entire period of observation, the lowest mortalities were found in men with serum cholesterol levels between 4.65 and 6.18 mmol/L (between 180 and 239 mg/dL). Manipulation of serum cholesterol levels below this level would not be desirable if this were to result in increased risk of death from cancer or other disease. This study does not rule out this possibility. \nGallstone lithotripsy: results when number of stones is excluded as a criterion for treatment. The Siemens Lithostar Plus protocol (Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin, NJ) allows investigators to perform gallstone lithotripsy on patients regardless of the number of stones they have, provided the stones occupy less than 50% of the gallbladder lumen. The purpose of this study was to determine the interrelationships between stone burden, fragmentation response, and stone-free rates when treatment is not limited to three stones or fewer. Of 200 patients initially examined, 80 (40%) underwent lithotripsy. The mean number of treatments per patient was 2.1, and the mean number of shock waves per patient was 7386. In 60 patients in whom 6-month follow-up was available, the overall stone-free rate, based on actual results, was 32% (19/60). The stone-free rates for solitary stones, two or three stones, and four or more stones were 50%, 12%, and 26%, respectively. Regardless of number of stones, patients who ultimately became stone free had significantly smaller mean fragment size (0.25 cm) 2 weeks after lithotripsy than did those who did not become stone free (0.51 cm). Retrospective volume analysis showed that seven (47%) of 15 patients with multiple stones occupying less than 2000 mm3 were stone free; none became stone free when this volume was exceeded. Lithotripsy remains a practical option for patients with solitary stones. Comparable stone-free rates to those achieved for solitary stones can be obtained in patients with multiple stones, regardless of their number, provided treatment is aggressive and the stone aggregate is less than 2000 mm3. \nRenin promoter SV40 T-antigen transgenic mouse. A model of primary renal vascular hyperplasia. Transgenic mice containing a ren-2 promoter T-antigen fusion construct (TAG+) develop renal vascular hypertrophy and hyperplasia associated with markedly suppressed renal renin mRNA, renal renin content, and plasma renin concentration. These animals are normotensive. In the present study, the renal and cardiovascular systems are characterized, revealing some surprising findings. Not only are the TAG+ mice normotensive in the face of pronounced renal pathology but also in the presence of an increase in plasma volume. These data raise interesting questions about blood pressure physiology and renal function of the TAG+ mice. Blood nitrogen urea of the TAG+ animal was markedly elevated and plasma creatinine level was in the normal range, indicating prerenal azotemia without renal failure. These findings are consistent with impaired renal perfusion with secondary volume expansion probably as the result of vascular hyperplasia. These transgenic animals provide a unique genetic model for studying the physiology of primarily renal vascular hyperplasia as well as blood pressure control in a low renin state. \nIfosfamide, Fanconi's syndrome, and rickets. Three of 218 children treated with ifosfamide plus the uroprotectant mesna, in single- or combination-agent protocols, have developed Fanconi's renal syndrome, all of whom were in a subgroup of 86 children who had also received cisplatin or carboplatin therapy. Patients receiving ifosfamide who have received prior cisplatin (or carboplatin) are at significantly higher risk of developing Fanconi's syndrome than are those who have received no prior nephrotoxic therapy (P = .04). The role of prior nephrotoxic therapy, including cisplatin and its derivatives, and the total dose of ifosfamide should be considered in the assessment of this rare but serious and apparently irreversible side effect. \nCardiac and whole-body [3H]noradrenaline kinetics during adrenaline infusion in man. 1. To investigate the possible role of adrenaline as a modulator of noradrenaline release from the sympathetic nervous system, the responses of cardiac and whole-body noradrenaline kinetics to intravenous infusions of adrenaline (30 ng min-1 kg-1) and matching saline placebo were determined at rest and during supine bicycle exercise in 16 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, in whom beta-adrenoceptor antagonists had been discontinued for 72 h. 2. At rest and compared with placebo, infusion of adrenaline was associated with a small increase in arterial plasma noradrenaline from 211 +/- 29 pg/ml to 245 +/- 29 pg/ml (P less than 0.05). Increases in whole-body noradrenaline spillover to arterial plasma were larger (from 282 +/- 40 ng min-1 m-2 to 358 +/- 41 ng min-1 m-2, P less than 0.01) and there was a trend towards an increase in whole-body noradrenaline clearance. Cardiac noradrenaline clearance was modestly increased during adrenaline infusion, but cardiac noradrenaline spillover was not altered despite increases in heart rate and coronary sinus plasma flow. Adrenaline infusion was associated with symptomatic myocardial ischaemia in four of 14 patients with coronary heart disease. 3. Supine bicycle exercise was associated with significant increases in peripheral noradrenaline concentrations and in cardiac and whole-body noradrenaline spillover. The increases on exercise were not significantly different for these variables during saline and adrenaline infusions. 4. Infusion of adrenaline to produce 'physiological' increases in plasma adrenaline concentration was associated with an increase in total noradrenaline release, as assessed by whole-body noradrenaline spillover to plasma. \nNational surveillance of dialysis-associated diseases in the United States, 1989. To determine trends in a variety of dialysis-associated diseases and practices, the Centers for Disease Control surveyed 1,867 chronic hemodialysis centers in the United States in 1989 in conjunction with the annual facility survey performed by the Health Care Financing Administration. The response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 92%. These 1,726 centers represented 122,734 patients and 32,486 staff members. The following results were found. 1) During the last 14 years, the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection decreased from 3.0 to 0.1% among patients, and from 2.6 to 0.1% among staff members. Over the same time, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity declined from 7.8 to 1.4% among patients and from 0.9 to 0.3% among staff members. Hepatitis B vaccine was given by 92% of the centers. By the end of 1989, 19% of susceptible patients and 55% of susceptible staff members had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. From 1982 to 1989, as a result of receiving vaccine, the prevalence of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) increased from 12 to 19% among patients and from 18 to 54% among staff. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1989 was reported to be 0.7% among patients and 0.1% among staff members. 2) Twenty-two percent of the centers reported pyrogenic reactions in the absence of septicemia among their patients, and 51% reported septicemia. 3) The reported incidence of dialysis dementia among hemodialysis patients was 0.2%, with a case fatality rate of 23%. 4) In 1989, 68% of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers; these centers treated 73% of the dialysis patient population. Among centers that reused disposable dialyzers, the average number of reuses ranged from 1 to 50 (mean, 12) and the maximum number of times a disposable dialyzer was ever reused ranged from 3 to 150 (mean, 28). Chemical germicides used for reprocessing dialyzers included formaldehyde, Renalin (a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based germicide), and glutaraldehyde-based germicides. Reuse of disposable dialyzers was not associated with any increased risk of acquiring HBV infection among either patients or staff. However, pyrogenic reactions occurring in clusters were reported more frequently in centers that reused conventional dialyzer membranes compared with centers that did not. This increased risk was associated only with centers that used Renalin or glutaraldehyde for reprocessing (not formaldehyde) and occurred with both automated and manual reprocessing systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nLack of effect of peritoneal endometriosis on fertility in the rabbit model. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the isolated influence of peritoneal endometrial implants on fertility in an adhesion-free rabbit model. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-two rabbits with endometrium implants were used; 31 rabbits with fat implants served as controls. In these rabbits parameters of early embryonic development were investigated. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted in ovulation, ovum pick-up, fertilization, tubal transport, and embryonic and fetal development. CONCLUSION: In the adhesion-free rabbit model, peritoneal implants of endometriosis do not have an effect on fertility. This supports the contention that therapies focused toward the implants are unlikely to change the pregnancy outcomes. Alternatively, it may cast doubts onto the relevance of animal models in studying this disease. \nIntraductal mucin-hypersecreting neoplasms of the pancreas. A clinicopathologic study of eight patients. Intraductal mucin-hypersecreting neoplasms of the pancreas with extreme dilatation of the main duct were studied in eight patients. They included five men and three women, aged 47-85 years. Five patients had a history of symptoms mimicking pancreatitis; four developed steatorrhea and/or diabetes. At endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, five patients showed an open ampulla filled with mucin, and six patients showed patchy filling defects in the ectatic main duct. Morphological examination showed extreme dilatation of the entire pancreatic duct in six patients and its tail segment in two patients. The duct segments filled with viscous mucin were lined by well-differentiated mucin-secreting cells, forming papillary foldings and occasionally showing cellular atypia. None of the patients had invasive tumor or metastasis. Six patients whose lesions were resected are alive and doing well (mean follow-up, 5.5 years). It is concluded that intraductal mucin-hypersecreting neoplasm is a pancreatic tumor with favorable prognosis. Because it shares many features with intraductal papillary neoplasm, a common pathogenesis of these pancreatic tumors is suggested. \nQuantification of vascular graft seeding by use of computer-assisted image analysis and genetically modified endothelial cells. Current methods for the evaluation of retention of endothelial cells seeded on vascular grafts are limited by the inability to specifically identify and quantitate seeded cells on a long-term basis. To address this problem we developed a method of quantification of graft surface coverage using genetic labeling of endothelial cells combined with computer-assisted image analysis. Rabbit aortic endothelial cells were transduced with a marker gene (lac-Z) and seeded on polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. After histochemical staining in which the genetically labeled cells turn blue, computer-assisted image analysis was used to measure the percentage of graft surface covered by the seeded cells. The utility of the method was evaluated by using it to assess the effect on graft coverage of seeded cell density and by precoating with fibronectin. Quantification of surface area coverage was automated and reproducible both between scans and between observers. Use of this method allowed the determination of a linear correlation between cell density in the seeding suspension and graft coverage (r2 = 0.93, p less than 0.0001). The method also permitted confirmation of the positive contribution of fibronectin coating to graft coverage by seeded cells: 73% coverage coated versus 8% coverage uncoated (p less than 0.0001). The ability of this method to specifically identify genetically marked endothelial cells and their progeny makes it attractive for use in studies targeted at optimization of graft coverage in vivo. \nSuppression by traumatic brain injury of spontaneous hemodynamic recovery from hemorrhagic shock in rats. The effects of brain trauma on cardiovascular and endocrine responses to hemorrhage were investigated. Forty anesthetized rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups of 10 rats each: a control group (Group C): a group with induction of hemorrhage at 16.2 ml/kg/10 min (Group H); a group with fluid-percussion brain injury at a peak pressure of 1.7 atm and an impulse duration of 25 msec (Group T); and a group receiving hemorrhagic shock following brain trauma (Group TH). Group C and T rats showed no significant alterations in cardiovascular function. At the end of hemorrhage there were no significant differences between Groups TH and H in the nadirs of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) (mean values +/- standard error of the mean: 42 +/- 2 vs. 40 +/- 4 mm Hg) and stroke volume index (SVI) (0.61 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.10 ml/bt/kg); however, 1 hour post-hemorrhage recovery was blunted in Group TH compared to Group H (MABP 56 +/- 4 vs. 65 +/- 3 mm Hg; cardiac index 182 +/- 15 vs. 220 +/- 15 ml/min/kg; and SVI 0.71 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.06 ml/bt/kg). Since the two groups showed no significant differences in heart rate, preload (central venous pressure), and afterload (systemic vascular resistance), the reduced cardiac index recovery in Group TH is believed due to the attenuation of cardiac contractile performance. The Group TH preparation potentiated hormonal responses to hemorrhage with significantly higher epinephrine and aldosterone levels than in Group H. Brain trauma enhanced the norepinephrine response to hemorrhage, even at an injury level that by itself did not result in an increase in this hormone. Group TH rats also had significantly lower blood pH and HCO3 levels. The data suggest that brain trauma suppresses MABP and cardiac index recovery after hemorrhage mainly by inhibiting cardiac contractile performance, probably due to high catecholamine levels and severe metabolic acidosis. \nAminophylline therapy for acute bronchospastic disease in the emergency room OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of aminophylline in the treatment of acute exacerbations of bronchospastic disease when used in addition to inhaled beta-agonists and intravenous corticosteroids. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-three adult patients with either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the emergency department with asthma or wheezing. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received therapy with both aerosolized metaproterenol and intravenous methyl-prednisolone. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a loading dose of aminophylline followed by a routine infusion (n = 65) or an equal volume of placebo as a loading dose and infusion (n = 68). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At discharge from the emergency department, the median serum theophylline concentration for the aminophylline group was 54 mumol/L (9.7 mg/L). The two groups showed no differences (P greater than 0.2) in measurements of forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at baseline or at 60 or 120 minutes after aminophylline administration. Neither patient satisfaction nor physician assessment of response to therapy differed between the two groups. There was no difference (P greater than 0.2) in the frequency of side effects, except for a trend toward a higher frequency of nausea (P = 0.13) in the aminophylline group. There was, however, a threefold decrease in the hospital admission rate for patients treated with aminophylline (6%) compared with placebo recipients (21%) (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Aminophylline, in doses producing levels just below the commonly accepted therapeutic range, appears to decrease hospital admissions in patients with acute exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This finding, if confirmed in larger studies, may represent a substantial cost savings. \nPerilymphatic fistula: surgical experience in the United States. One survey sent to 6953 individual otolaryngologic practices and 106 departments of otolaryngology at teaching hospitals in the United States, and a more limited survey of 75 patients operated on for perilymphatic fistula (PLF) at the House Ear Institute, addressed aspects of managing PLF: surgical incidence, reliability of diagnostic test, preoperative observations, and disability after surgery. Of surgeons sampled, 93% estimated incidence of PLF surgery to be less than or equal to 1 per 1000 otolaryngologic outpatient visits. The most reliable diagnostic indicators were history, symptomatology, and tympanometric and electronystagmographic fistula tests. About 72% of surgeons reported less than 4 weeks' average delay before surgery. Most surgeons and patients (greater than or equal to 70%) rated length of disability before return to work, exposure to noise, travel by airplane, swimming, and heavy lifting, at several weeks to several months. Diving was the most restricted activity. Results suggest that incidence of surgery and disability with PFL in the United States is very limited. \nLeber's hereditary optic neuropathy and Kearns-Sayre syndrome: mitochondrial DNA mutations. Mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) supplies extranuclear (cytoplasmic) genes which program the manufacture of 13 of the 67 peptides of the mitochondrial respiratory enzymes. The remaining 54 are coded by nuclear DNA. All human children and adults, male and female, are entirely dependent on the cytoplasm of the ovum for their complement of mt DNA; the sperm contributes none. Accordingly, mutations in the mt DNA in a mother's ova will be passed on to all her children, although not all are clinically affected. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is in most cases due to a mutation that leads to the replacement of guanine by adenine at position 11778 in mt DNA. This causes histidine to be inserted instead of the normal arginine at the site of the 340th amino acid in the respiratory enzyme NADH subunit 4, hence its defective function. Other point mutations in the mt DNA coding for polypeptides of the respiratory chain complex or controlling sequences coded by mt DNA have been found in other families with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Mitochondrial DNA is the site of other mutations as well. For ophthalmologists, the most important of these is the rare Kearns-Sayre syndrome (pigmentary retinopathy plus muscular dystrophies, especially of the extraocular muscles). Kearns-Sayre syndrome is due to deletions in the mt DNA, which vary in size and so affect a number of different respiratory enzymes, hence the variable manifestations. Cases are usually sporadic because the disease is often so severe that affected individuals do not reproduce if they survive, but in some cases inheritance from the mother has been reported. \nOptic nerve hypoplasia, encephalopathy, and neurodevelopmental handicap. Abnormalities of the central nervous system are frequently described in optic nerve hypoplasia. In a longitudinal study of 46 consecutive children (32 term, 14 preterm) with bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia 32 (69.5%) had associated neurodevelopmental handicap. Of these, 90% had structural central nervous system abnormalities on computed tomographic brain scans. Neurodevelopmental handicap occurred in 62.5% of the term and 86% of the preterm infants respectively. Term infants had a greater incidence of ventral developmental midline defects and proportionately fewer maternal and/or neonatal complications throughout pregnancy, while encephaloclastic lesions were commoner among the premature infants. An association of optic nerve hypoplasia with the twin transfusion syndrome and prenatal vascular encephalopathies is described. \nThe antishock pelvic clamp. Unstable posterior pelvic ring disruptions are frequently accompanied by severe venous bleeding and hypotension. Mechanical stabilization has been shown to help reduce such blood loss. A new external fixator called an antishock clamp provides direct reduction and compression of such fracture-diastases about the sacroiliac joint. It is used acutely to rapidly stabilize the posterior pelvic ring in hypotensive patients. The simplicity of design allows the device to be applied in less than ten minutes in the emergency room. Most importantly, it does not interfere with the ability to carry out subsequent laparotomy or other required procedures. Although more clinical experience is needed, the clamp has provided hemodynamic stabilization accompanying fracture reduction. The device is not expected to be of benefit in the cases with significant bleeding of arterial origin. \nManagement of verrucous carcinoma of the larynx. Eight patients with a verrucous carcinoma of the larynx have been seen at the Charing Cross Hospital between 1970 and 1985. Seven patients were treated by primary radiotherapy and one by primary endoscopic laser excision. Four of those treated with radiotherapy developed recurrent disease which was treated by radical surgery in three and by endoscopic laser excision in one. The place of radiotherapy in the management of this condition requires further evaluation in view of the high rate of recurrence. Endoscopic laser excision may be a reasonable alternative to more radical surgery in this highly differentiated neoplasm. \nMotion artifact simulating aortic dissection on CT. We recently imaged two patients clinically suspected of having aortic dissection whose contrast-enhanced CT examinations, obtained on a new scanner with a 1-sec scanning time, showed findings suggesting an ascending aortic dissection. The subsequent clinical course and evaluation implied that the CT findings were predominantly artifactual. We identified identical artifacts in 18% of 50 consecutive contrast-enhanced CT examinations performed for a variety of indications on the same scanner. The double-lumen artifact, simulating an intimal flap, occurs in the proximal ascending aorta and is limited to one or two contiguous transaxial images. The artifact was not detected on two other CT units. We believe the artifact arises from motion of the aortic wall and the surrounding pericardial recesses during image acquisition. \nManagement of ventricular septal defect with associated aortic incompetence. Twenty-two patients with a ventricular septal defect and aortic incompetence underwent surgical repair. Mean age was 9.6 years (range, 9 to 15 years). Mean follow-up was 32.4 +/- 15.8 months. The ventricular septal defect was perimembranous in 19 patients and doubly committed or juxtaarterial in 3. Most showed only a small left-to-right shunt. Mean diameter was 11.9 +/- 4.8 mm. Aortic incompetence was mild in 6 patients, moderate in 4, and severe in 12. In 16 patients closure of the ventricular septal defect and aortic valvoplasty were both performed through the aortic root. There were no deaths. All patients retained normal sinus rhythm. No complete heart block was found. In 3 patients secondary aortic valve replacement was required for severe incompetence; in 1 the cause was bacterial endocarditis, in another technical failure, and in a third progressive incompetence over an 8-month period. All patients showed substantial clinical improvement, marked decrease or disappearance of the valvar incompetence, diminution of the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and decreased cardiothoracic ratio. We conclude that primary repair is the operation of choice for this combination of lesions. This can avoid or delay considerably valvar replacement. The left-sided approach proves safe and is our preferred technique. \nClinical and flow cytometry characteristics of malignant pleural effusions in patients after intracavitary administration of methylprednisolone acetate. Ten patients with recurrent pleural effusions due to advanced cancer were treated by intracavitary methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol [DM], Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI). They received one to six courses of DM (median, three courses per patient) with doses ranging from 80 to 160 mg per course. Effusion cells were cryopreserved before and during DM installation for subsequent determination of ploidy by flow cytometry. Pleural effusion in all three patients with advanced breast cancer resolved and did not reaccumulate throughout follow-up for 11+, 10+, and 8+ months. Pleural effusion in a patient with metastatic gastric cancer and in two of four patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown origin partially resolved. Altogether six of ten patients (60%) subjectively and objectively benefited from this therapy. All patients tolerated the treatment well with no local or systemic side effects. Flow cytometry showed a reduction in ploidy of effusion cells in all three patients with breast cancer, from a peak mean channel of 6C to nearly 2C after therapy. Transient reduction of ploidy was seen also in the effusion of a patient with unknown primary tumor associated with clinical improvement. The clinical and laboratory data reported offers initial evidence that DM when instilled into the pleural cavity after incomplete thoracentesis may act as effective palliative therapy either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents. \nMeningiomas of the lateral skull base: neurotologic manifestations and patterns of recurrence. The eradication of basicranial meningiomas by traditional surgical techniques is often hindered by neoplastic entanglement with critical neurovascular structures. Apparent, complete tumor resection is frequently followed by extensive, yet clinically silent, recurrent disease with local infiltration of bone, cranial nerves, and brain. Fifty-five cases of sphenoid wing or parasellar meningioma were analyzed to identify clinical manifestations suggestive of early tumor recurrence. Regrowth patterns were then defined according to preoperative radiographic and intraoperative surgical findings. Medial tumor regrowth, involving the cavernous sinus, caused neurapraxia of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI, with associated diplopia or ophthalmoplegia. Inferior (caudal) regrowth of disease involved the infratemporal fossa, pterygomaxillary space, or paranasal sinuses by bony erosion of the middle cranial fossa floor or through natural anatomic foramina and fissures. Such inferior extension was manifested clinically by facial hypesthesia, trismus, and referred otalgia caused by trigeminal nerve involvement and by autophony or serous otitis media related to eustachian tube obstruction. Posterior tumor regrowth occurred along the petrous bone and horizontal carotid canal, resulting in internal auditory meatus erosion and cerebellopontine angle extension with associated tinnitus, hearing loss, unsteadiness, and occasional facial twitching. While the clinical and radiographic evaluations of any patient with a suspected recurrent basicranial meningioma are critical in planning the method and magnitude of reoperation, an understanding of potential recurrence patterns can be used in devising more extensive, combined approaches that may allow complete tumor extirpation at the initial surgical intervention. \nPharmacologic roles of heparin and glucocorticoids to prevent restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is the major clinical problem limiting the long-term efficacy of this treatment for coronary atherosclerosis. Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of restenosis indicate that intimal hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells is the predominant cause for restenosis. Therefore, therapeutic agents that inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation should be candidate drugs to prevent restenosis. Heparin has documented antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells, and the availability of low molecular weight heparins that lack anticoagulant properties makes them ideal agents. Glucocorticoids have wide effects on inflammatory and wound healing events and inhibit smooth muscle cell growth in culture and in animal models of arterial injury. Recent laboratory data suggest that combination therapy with both low molecular weight heparin and hydrocortisone may be a powerful treatment regimen to limit restenosis. \nCarbon dioxide laser treatment for vulval papillomatosis (vulvodynia). Genital papillomatosis accompanied by distressing vulval symptoms is often termed vulvodynia. Common presenting symptoms are vulvar burning, pruritus and dyspareunia. Sixteen patients with vulval papillomatosis (vulvodynia) have been treated by carbon dioxide laser therapy over a 4-year period. Initial responses at 6 weeks appeared encouraging but with follow-up it became apparent that the relapse rate was high, with a mean symptom-free interval of 4.6 months. Of the 16 patients treated, only three remain symptom free. In view of our findings, we recommend that laser therapy should not be offered as a primary procedure, if at all, for patients with vulval papillomatosis. \nPurification of a plasma membrane-associated GTPase-activating protein specific for rap1/Krev-1 from HL60 cells. rap1/Krev-1 is a p21ras-related GTP-binding protein that has been implicated in the reversion of the ras-transformed cell phenotype. We have identified a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific for rap in plasma membranes isolated from differentiated HL60 cells. The rap GAP activity remained quantitatively associated with the membrane following washes with buffered 1 M LiCl containing 20 mM EDTA but was solubilized with the detergents Nonidet P-40 and deoxycholate. On the basis of size-exclusion chromatography, the membrane-associated rap GAP (rap GAPm) appeared distinct from the rap GAP detected in the cytosolic fraction from HL60 cells. The molecular sizes of the membrane and cytosolic forms were estimated to be 36 and 54 A, respectively. rap GAPm was solubilized and purified to near homogeneity by successive column chromatographies in the presence of detergent. The rap GAPm activity corresponded to a single polypeptide that migrated with a molecular mass of approximately 88 kDa on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. The purified rap GAPm was inactive toward the GTP-bound forms of p21ras, rho, G25K, and rac-1 and did not stimulate dissociation of guanine nucleotide from rap. \nHigh fecundity of amenorrhoeic women in embryo-transfer programmes. There is uncertainty over whether the steady decline in human fertility with increasing maternal age is due to quality of the oocyte or of the endometrium. To clarify the issue age-related implantation and pregnancy rates in two embryo-transfer programmes were examined in relation to embryo quality and type of menstrual cycle. In both the UK and the US programmes rates were higher in previously amenorrhoeic (acyclic) women than in eugonadal women, irrespective of age and number of embryos replaced. Oocyte quality, as determined by age of oocyte donor, in-vitro growth of embryo, and proportion of defective embryos in culture, did not contribute to the difference, nor did type of cycle during therapy. If a uterus that has not been subjected to regular menstrual cycles is a favourable factor, a period of induced amenorrhoea might be beneficial for infertile women. \nSteroid-responsive tubular aggregate myopathy. We report a man with an acute myalgia/cramp syndrome and tubular aggregates on his muscle biopsy. He was placed on prednisone and was found to be exquisitely sensitive to the drug, with changes of only 5 mg precipitating recurrence of symptoms. He was eventually tapered off all steroids, without symptoms, and repeat biopsy showed no tubular aggregates. We recommend similar patients be given a trial of high-dose steroids. \nRisk factors for stroke in middle aged British men. OBJECTIVE--To determine the risk factors for stroke in a cohort representative of middle aged British men. DESIGN--Prospective study of a cohort of men followed up for eight years. SETTING--General practices in 24 towns in England, Wales, and Scotland (the British regional heart study). SUBJECTS--7735 men aged 40-59 at screening, selected at random from one general practice in each town. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Fatal and non-fatal strokes. RESULTS--110 of the men had at least one stroke; there were four times as many non-fatal as fatal strokes. The relative risk of stroke was 12.1 in men who had high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg) and were current smokers compared with normotensive, non-smoking men. Diastolic blood pressure yielded no additional information, and former cigarette smokers had the same risk as men who had never smoked. Heavy alcohol intake was associated with a relative risk of stroke of 3.8 in men without previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Men with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease had an increased risk of stroke, but only when left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography was also present. CONCLUSIONS--Systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography in men with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease were found to be the major risk factors for stroke in middle aged British men. Heavy alcohol intake seemed to increase the risk of stroke in men without previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. A large proportion of strokes should be preventable by controlling blood pressure and stopping smoking. \nDiagnosis and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma: comparison of CT and sonography in 36 liver transplantation patients. Radiologic studies are important in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma and the selection of patients for partial liver resection, liver transplantation, or palliation. We retrospectively studied 36 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were examined with both CT and sonography before undergoing hepatic transplantation. Pathologic findings of the entire resected liver were correlated with results of imaging studies before transplantation. Parenchymal lesions were shown by sonography in 29 cases (81%) and by CT in 34 cases (94%). Although CT was more sensitive than sonography was, both CT and sonography frequently failed to depict reliably the size of tumor or the exact number of tumor nodules as determined pathologically. Pathologic findings showed vascular invasion in 19 cases (53%), whereas CT showed invasion in 11 cases (31%) and sonography showed it in only six (17%). Nodal metastasis to the porta hepatis was found in four patients; CT correctly showed two cases (three false-positive) and sonography correctly showed one case. Intrahepatic ductal dilatation was seen in eight patients on CT but was not identified on sonography. We conclude that CT is more accurate for identifying and staging hepatocellular carcinoma, but both CT and sonography frequently fail to depict the extent (size and number of lesions) of disease, especially when underlying cirrhosis is present. \nDoppler sonographic imaging of the vascular system. Report of the Ultrasonography Task Force. Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association. Ultrasonic vascular imaging has been used for more than 20 years to define vascular anatomy, pathologic changes in vessel size, and perivascular abnormalities. In the last decade, development of duplex Doppler technology has permitted the evaluation of both anatomic vascular features and physiologic blood flow parameters in a variety of locations. Doppler \"color flow\" imaging promises to expand these applications. In many instances, duplex Doppler technology has replaced more invasive angiographic procedures for evaluation of suspected vascular abnormalities. Improved ultrasound duplex technology, combined with the relatively inexpensive, rapid, noninvasive aspects of ultrasonography has made it a valuable screening examination for suspected flow abnormalities. \nHemodynamic effects of varied graft diameters in the venous system. Both in vivo and mathematical models of venous hypertension were used to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm diameter cross-femoral venous bypass grafts (CFBs). Eighteen grafts (length 138 +/- 3.4 mm) were tested in paired sequential fashion (four grafts, 4 and 8 mm; five grafts, 6 and 10 mm) in nine greyhounds (femoral vein diameter, 7.7 +/- 0.09 mm). Bilateral hindlimb venous pressures and flows were measured before and after unilateral iliofemoral venous ligation, 30 minutes after CFB insertion, and for 5 minutes after venous flow augmentation induced by stimulated muscle contraction. CFBs of all sizes were equally effective at relieving the occlusive venous hypertension at rest. Muscle contraction elevated venous pressure in all ligated hindlimbs (p less than 0.0001); however, the pressure returned to baseline by 3 minutes in dogs with 6, 8, and 10 mm grafts but remained elevated (p less than 0.05) with the 4 mm grafts even after 5 minutes. Peak graft flow (first 90 seconds after contraction) was significantly greater through the 8 mm grafts than through the 4 mm grafts (p less than 0.01), although no difference was noted in flow rates between 6 and 10 mm grafts. The pressure gradient across the graft as predicted by the mathematic model for 6 to 10 mm conduits was less than 5 mm Hg for flows up to 1000 ml/min, although the pressure gradient of the 4 mm graft exceeded 5 mm Hg at 200 ml/min and approached 30 mm Hg at 1000 ml/min. Therefore, data from both canine and mathematical models agreed that, at rates approximating human resting flow (1000 ml/min), no adverse short-term hemodynamic consequences result from CFB conduits of 6 to 10 mm diameter. \nNew treatments for Chlamydia trachomatis. Standard regimens of tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin, if compiled with, appear to be effective against Chlamydia trachomatis infections under most circumstances. However, the organism may sometimes persist despite what would seem to be adequate therapy. How often this occurs, to what extent noncompliance is the issue, and the role antibiotic resistance plays remain to be determined. Among newer antibiotics, azithromycin appears to be effective in the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital C. trachomatis infections. Single-dose therapy with azithromycin may be especially useful in overcoming compliance problems associated with the treatment of sexually transmitted disease. \nActinomycosis in obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis. A quantitative analysis of adenoid and tonsillar specimens from 460 patients was performed. The patients underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy for either recurrent tonsillitis or obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy. Histologic preparations revealed Actinomycetes as statistically more prevalent in the obstructive population. The presence of Actinomycetes in the adenotonsillar core of this diagnostic group may indicate an etiologic role for this organism in tonsillar and adenoidal hypertrophy. \nManagement of bleeding ulcers. Hemorrhage is a common complication of peptic ulcer disease and is increased in frequency and severity with aspirin and NSAID use. A variety of clinical and endoscopic factors associated with an increased mortality rate from ulcer bleeding have been identified, the most important of which are presentation in shock and ongoing or recurrent bleeding after routine resuscitative measures. After hemodynamic stabilization, the goal of therapy is to diminish the chance that an ulcer will continue to bleed or will rebleed. Currently, this is best achieved by one of several endoscopic interventions in carefully selected patients. The most effective endoscopic techniques for decreasing the risk of ulcer rebleeding are multipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe thermal coagulation, and injection therapy in patients with active bleeding or a visible vessel in the ulcer base. Injection therapy may be used alone or in combination with either of the other two techniques. The major impact of therapeutic endoscopy appears to be a reduction in the number of emergent operations necessary to control hemorrhage. The mortality of emergent surgery for bleeding ulcer is prohibitive, and any means of reducing the need for surgery is likely to have a beneficial effect on survival. \nExcision of limbal dermoids. We reviewed the clinical files of 10 patients who had undergone excision of unilateral epibulbar limbal dermoids. Preoperatively, all of the affected eyes had worse visual acuity (P less than .02) and more astigmatism (P less than .01) than the contralateral eyes. Postoperatively, every patient was cosmetically improved. Of the eight patients for whom both preoperative and postoperative visual acuity measurements had been obtained, in six it had changed minimally (less than or equal to 1 line), and in two it had improved (less than or equal to 2 lines). Surgical complications included persistent epithelial defects (40%) and peripheral corneal vascularization and opacity (70%). These complications do not outweigh the cosmetic and visual benefits of dermoid excision in selected patients. \nIntracavernous carotid artery aneurysm presenting as recurrent epistaxis. Massive epistaxis from a leaking intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm is a rare occurrence. Such an unusual case is presented with appropriate imaging and a successful treatment program. \nVariable regression of experimental bronchial preneoplasia during carcinogenesis. It has been thought that squamous severe atypical metaplasia of the bronchus is reliably precancerous. The canine subcutaneous bronchial autograft model for studying the progression of epidermoid carcinogenesis (normal----regular squamous metaplasia----mild, moderate, and severe atypical metaplasia----squamous cell carcinoma) provides evidence that severe atypical metaplasia of the bronchial epithelium is reversible. Among 148 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that had serial sampling of the epithelium and exposure to implants of methylcholanthrene, severe atypical metaplasia was noted in 28 that received only a single implant. During the total carcinogen exposure (median 24.5 months), 9 of 28 (32%) developed squamous cell cancer, and 19 of 28 (68%) regressed toward normal. Severe atypical metaplasia was noted in 34 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that received two or more carcinogen implants: epidermoid cancer developed in 26 of 34 (76.5%), and regression toward or to normal occurred in 8 of 34 (23.5%). Severe atypical metaplasia was not detected in 53 subcutaneous bronchial autografts: 19 that received only a single implant and 34 that received two or more implants. Progression and regression occurred among these subcutaneous bronchial autografts in proportions similar to those found in subcutaneous bronchial autografts wherein severe atypical metaplasia was seen. Among 33 subcutaneous bronchial autografts initially studied after 6 months of exposure to carcinogen, progression to severe atypical metaplasia was seen 3 months later in 19 of 33 that had additional exposure; in the same interval regression of epithelial abnormalities occurred in 14 of 33 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that had no additional exposure (p less than 0.05). We have presented evidence that severe atypical metaplasia includes at least three cell populations: one committed to cancer without further stimulus, one that regresses despite further carcinogen exposure, and one that requires additional carcinogen to progress to cancer. At least in this model, severe atypical metaplasia is not inexorably precancerous. The subcutaneous bronchial autograft model is suitable for seeking biologic indicators of irreversibility. \nFailure of motor evoked potentials to predict neurologic outcome in experimental thoracic aortic occlusion. Motor evoked potential monitoring was tested as an alternative to somatosensory evoked potential monitoring in evaluating spinal cord function during thoracic aortic occlusion in dogs. Twenty-seven animals underwent 60 minutes of cross-clamping of the proximal descending thoracic aorta with (n = 18) or without (n = 9) cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Spinal cord blood flow was measured with microspheres, and neurologic outcome was evaluated at 24 hours with Tarlov's scoring system. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage improved neurologic outcome (p less than 0.05). Motor evoked potentials recorded over the lumbar spinal cord were lost in 9 of 20 dogs with ischemic cord injury and were not lost in any of the 7 dogs that were neurologically normal. Somatosensory evoked potential were lost in 19 of 20 paraplegic/paraparetic dogs and lost in 3 of 7 normal dogs (p less than 0.01). After reperfusion, motor evoked potentials returned in all nine neurologically injured dogs that lost the potentials and were still present at 24 hours. Changes in amplitude, latency, or time until loss or return of motor evoked potentials or somatosensory evoked potentials did not predict neurologic injury. Loss of somatosensory evoked potentials had a high sensitivity (95%) but had low specificity (67%) because of peripheral nerve ischemia. Loss of motor evoked potentials recorded from the spinal cord had high specificity (100%) but a low sensitivity (46%) and was therefore not a reliable predictor of neurologic injury. Return of motor evoked potentials during reperfusion did not correlate with functional recovery. Motor evoked potentials stimulated in the cortex and recorded from the spinal cord had low overall accuracy (59%). \nTransoral approach to the upper cervical spine. The transoral approach to pathology of the upper cervical spine is logical, but it is seldom used due to concerns about exposure and infection. The authors report on 16 consecutive patients requiring exposure from clivus through C3 for pathology, including spinal cord compression by rheumatoid pannus, craniovertebral anomalies, and tumor. Exposure was obtained using a Dingman mouth gag and soft palate retraction with silicone rubber sheeting. A horizontal \"H\" incision was made in the posterior pharyngeal wall creating three layers, closed separately, with attention to a watertight closure of the final mucosal layer. In no case was it necessary to divide the mandible, tongue, soft palate, or uvula. There were no deaths, wound breakdowns, infections, or persistent cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Patients with neurological indications improved postoperatively, and all tumors were grossly resected. Combined otolaryngology/neurosurgical exposure and treatment of pathology involving the upper cervical spine via the transoral approach is safe and effective. Functional results have been excellent, and no major complications were encountered. \nSymptomatic diverticulum of the 4th ventricle. A case of symptomatic diverticulum of the 4th ventricle in a 57-year-old man is presented. This clinicopathological observation supports a relationship between ventricular diverticula and ependyma-lined paraventricular cysts. \nSegregation analysis reveals evidence of a major gene for Alzheimer disease. In an attempt to resolve the relative influences of major genes, multifactorial heritability, and cohort effects on the susceptibility to Alzheimer disease (AD), complex segregation analysis was performed on 232 nuclear families. All families were consecutively ascertained through a single proband who was referred for diagnostic evaluation of a memory disorder. The results suggest that susceptibility to AD is determined, in part, by a major autosomal dominant allele with an additional multifactorial component. Single-locus, polygenic, sporadic, and no-transmission models, as well as recessive inheritance of the major effect, were significantly rejected. Excess transmission from the heterozygote was marginally significant and probably reflects the presence of phenocopies or perhaps the existence of two or more major loci for AD. The frequency of the AD susceptibility allele was estimated to be .038, but the major locus accounts for only 24% of the transmission variance, indicating a substantial role for other genetic and nongenetic mechanisms in the causation of AD. \nCirrhosis of the liver. A regenerative process. The ancient story of Prometheus, chained to a rock for defying Zeus by stealing fire from Mount Olympus and subjected to daily tearing at his liver by an eagle, attests to the early recognition of the extraordinary regenerative capacity of the human liver. This process had remained an intriguing mystery over the millennia. In the last 20 years, following the pioneering work of Bucher (1) and Moolten et al (2), there has been an explosion of research that has clarified some of the mechanisms underlying the process of hepatic regeneration. Regeneration implies proliferation and regeneration. After the fetal and postnatal growth of the liver is completed, hepatocytes no longer proliferate actively, but they can proliferate in response to cell death or loss (3). Hepatocyte growth responses are of particular research interest because they occur in vivo and involve cells that are normally quiescent. Hepatic regeneration constitutes a highly regulated process that is best shown by the arrest of liver growth following a partial hepatectomy precisely at the moment the hepatic mass reaches the mass of the original intact liver (3). This suggests that hepatic regeneration after a partial hepatectomy is a strictly regulated nonautonomous growth process that is controlled by the same factors that are responsible for the determination and maintenance of hepatic mass in a normal individual. In response to a partial hepatectomy, hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and progress to DNA synthesis and replication but only in numbers sufficient to restore the hepatic mass. The regeneration response is both synchronized and universal in that it affects all intrahepatic cell lines, including nonparenchymal cells. \nBacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 for treatment of superficial bladder cancer. A total of 22 patients with bladder cancer received bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and interleukin-2. Significant bladder tumor remissions were noted in 15 of 17 patients (88%). Of 5 patients with carcinoma in situ 1 was noncompliant and he died of carcinoma in situ. The other 4 patients are in remission. BCG alone was instilled in 22 additional patients with superficial bladder cancer. The remission rates were encouraging. Of the 22 patients 13 (59%) had remission of the bladder tumor. A half dose of BCG (60 mg.) is adequate when given weekly for 6 weeks. Maintenance therapy is important as noted in both of our clinical arms. BCG and interleukin-2 therapy results in a higher remission rate. \nCoronary venous retroperfusion support during high risk angioplasty in patients with unstable angina: preliminary experience. Synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion was used during coronary balloon angioplasty to support the ischemic myocardium of 20 patients with unstable angina and anatomy at high risk of a coronary event. Hemodynamics and left ventricular function were the major end points of the study. Coronary venous catheterization and retroperfusion were successfully performed in 15 patients. The target vessel was an unprotected left main artery in 2, left anterior descending artery in 10, left circumflex coronary artery in 1 and right coronary artery in 2 patients. A nonsupported balloon inflation (mean 44 +/- 13 s) was compared with a later retroperfusion-supported inflation (mean 145 +/- 21 s). Right anterior oblique left ventriculograms, aortic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and thermodilution cardiac output were obtained before and during peak untreated and treated balloon inflations and on completion of angioplasty. All patients had either a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.40 or greater than 40% of contracting myocardium estimated to be at risk for severe ischemia during angioplasty. The cardiac (liters/min per m2) and stroke work (g.m/m2) indexes decreased from mean baseline values of 2.5 +/- 0.52 and 52 +/- 15 to 1.7 +/- 0.47 and 27 +/- 12 (mean +/- SD), respectively, during nonsupported balloon inflations but decreased only to 2.1 +/- 0.52 (p less than 0.01 vs. nonsupported) and to 36 +/- 14 (p = 0.01 vs. nonsupported), respectively, during retroperfusion-supported inflations. Ejection fraction (n = 8) decreased from a baseline value of 55 +/- 13% to 27 +/- 7.3% during nonsupported inflations but only to 39 +/- 10% during retroperfusion-supported inflations (p = 0.01 vs. nonsupported). Regional wall motion (area change) in the ischemic (target) region was reduced from a baseline value of 49 +/- 17% to 11 +/- 16% during nonsupported inflations but only to 27 +/- 15% during retroperfusion-supported inflations (p less than 0.01 vs. nonsupported). All but two patients had a favorable hemodynamic response to retroperfusion. There were no serious adverse effects related to the procedures and no hospital deaths. It is concluded from this preliminary study that coronary venous retroperfusion appears to be safe, to provide hemodynamic support and to improve left ventricular function during angioplasty in patients with unstable angina and anatomy at high risk of a coronary event. \nImproved survival after resection of pulmonary metastases from malignant melanoma The value of resecting pulmonary metastases from malignant melanoma was retrospectively examined. Between 1981 and 1989, 56 patients (35 men and 21 women with a mean age of 49 years) had 65 pulmonary resections for histologically proven metastatic melanoma after treatment of the primary tumor. In patients undergoing thoracotomy, 50% (28/56) had pulmonary metastases as the initial site of recurrence. Twenty-eight patients (50%) had local-regional recurrence before the development of lung metastases. Eight lobectomies, two segmentectomies, and 55 wedge excisions were done. Fifty-four patients (54/56, 96%) underwent complete resection, and there were no operative deaths. The postthoracotomy actuarial survival was 25% at 5 years (median interval, 18 months). Location of the primary tumor, histology, thickness, Clark level, local-regional lymph node metastases, or type of resection was not associated with improved survival. Patients without regional nodal metastases before thoracotomy had a median survival of 30 months compared with 16 months for all others (p = 0.04). Patients with lung as the site of first recurrence had a median survival of 30 months compared with 17 months for patients with initial local-regional recurrence (p = 0.038, log-rank test). Despite systemic spread, patients with isolated pulmonary metastases from melanoma may benefit from metastasectomy. \nHuman T-cell leukemia/lymphoma viruses. Life cycle, pathogenicity, epidemiology, and diagnosis. Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) was discovered in 1980, and it subsequently was found to be the cause of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. A progressive neurologic disease known as tropical spastic paraparesis, or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, has also been linked to infection with HTLV-I. A related virus, HTLV type II (HTLV-II), has been isolated from patients with hairy-cell leukemia, but it has not been proved to be the cause of any disease. In late 1988, US blood banks began screening all blood donations for antibodies to HTLV-I/II. This program has resulted in the identification of many unexpectedly seropositive blood donors and provided much information about the prevalence of HTLV-I/II in the United States. In this article, I review the replication of these agents, as well as their pathogenesis, diagnosis, and mechanisms of spread. \nNutritional aspects and swallowing function of patients with Parkinson's disease. Seven patients with Parkinson's disease and three patients with progressive supranuclear palsy underwent adrenal medullary transplant to the caudate nucleus for treatment of their neurologic disease. Preoperative nutritional assessment demonstrated that a significant number of the Parkinson's patients had mild to moderate nutritional depletion. Motility problems, manifest by dysphagia and delayed gastric emptying causing problems over a number of years, were probably responsible. Of the 10 patients studied, 6 were studied by videofluoroscopy. All patients had variable dysphagia of variable servility with or without aspiration. Etiologic factors included the basic underlying neurologic disease, delay in resumption of anti-parkinsonian medications, use of metoclopramide, and postoperative medical complications leading to a debilitated clinical state. \nThe effects of sucralfate and luminal stasis on recovery of the chambered rat gastric mucosa from taurocholate-induced damage. We have previously shown, using a gastric chamber model, that both sucralfate and luminal stasis protected the rat gastric mucosa against the development of hemorrhagic erosions produced by subsequent exposure for 10 minutes to acidified (50 mM HCl) 80 mM sodium taurocholate (NaT). The protection afforded by sucralfate was abolished by inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity but restored by sucralfate. In this study we demonstrate that indomethacin pretreatment decreases both the depth (in microns) and magnitude (in pH units) of the juxtamucosal pH gradient, but that sucralfate restores these parameters to levels characteristic of normal mucosae. The cytoprotective effect of sucralfate is thus prostaglandin-independent and, at least in part, a consequence of sucralfate-induced increases in the thickness of the juxtamucosal pH gradient/unstirred layer. We have also examined the ability of sucralfate to prevent the otherwise inevitable development of hemorrhagic erosions when it was applied after the gastric mucosa was exposed to NaT. When 100 mg sucralfate in 50 mM HCl was applied for 10 minutes, without stirring, subsequent to a 10-minute exposure of the mucosa to NaT, the average lesion area was reduced from about 15% to less than 3%. Unlike its cytoprotective property, the ability of sucralfate to accelerate the recovery process after damage was abolished by indomethacin pretreatment. Studies using antimony microelectrodes revealed that indomethacin pretreatment resulted in reductions in both the depth and magnitude of the pH gradient that resulted from plasma efflux from the mucosa after exposure to the acidified bile salt. These studies demonstrate that sucralfate is capable not only of prevention or attenuation of acute damage when administered prior to damaging agents, but is also capable of arresting the sequence of events that produces hemorrhage in the previously inflamed or damaged stomach. \nAssessment of energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry in healthy subjects and patients with liver cirrhosis. The reliability of resting energy expenditure (REE) measurements by indirect calorimetry with a ventilated hood was investigated in 50 healthy controls and 10 patients with liver cirrhosis. In each subject basal energy expenditure (BEE) was determined once and REE three times (morning REE1, noon REE2, afternoon REE3). In controls and patients the first 5-minute BEE and first 5-minute REE (controls also second 5-minute REE) were higher than in the remainder of the 30-minute recording. Only the last 20 minutes of recordings were used to calculate BEE (1645 +/- 315, mean +/- SD, in kilocalories per day), REE1 (1880 +/- 365), REE2 (1782 +/- 384), and REE3 (1775 +/- 316) in controls, and in cirrhotics: BEE (1530 +/- 235), REE1 (1714 +/- 267), REE2 (1715 +/- 238), and REE3 (1779 +/- 275). REE was higher than BEE in controls and cirrhotics (p less than 0.05). The REE variation coefficient was 5 +/- 3% in controls and 5 +/- 2% in cirrhotics. No systematic difference between REE1, REE2, and REE3 was found. Energy expenditure predicted by the Harris-Benedict equation differed up to 21% from measured BEE in individual controls; group mean BEE, however, was correctly predicted. In cirrhotics differences between measured and predicted BEE up to 26% occurred, while measured BEE was higher than predicted BEE (p = 0.06). It is concluded that REE can be reliably assessed by indirect calorimetry with a ventilated hood system in controls and patients at any time of the day, when values obtained in the first 10 minutes are deleted. \nLeft ventricular midwall mechanics in systemic arterial hypertension. Myocardial function is depressed in pressure-overload hypertrophy. BACKGROUND. Left ventricular (LV) midwall geometry has been described conventionally as the sum of the chamber radius and half of the wall thickness; this convention is based on the assumption of uniform transmural thickening during systole. However, theoretical considerations and experimental data indicate that the inner half (inner shell) of the LV wall thickens more than the outer half (outer shell). Thus, an end-diastolic circumferential midwall fiber exhibits a relative migration toward the epicardium during systole. As a result, the conventional method provides an overestimate of the extent of the midwall fiber shortening. METHODS AND RESULTS. We developed an ellipsoidal model with a concentric two-shell geometry (nonuniform thickening) to assess midwall fiber length transients throughout the cardiac cycle. This modified midwall method was used in the analysis of LV cineangiograms from 15 patients with systemic arterial hypertension and 14 normal subjects. Study groups were classified according to LV mass index (LVMI): 14 normal subjects (group I), eight hypertensive patients with a normal LVMI (group II), and seven hypertensive patients with an increased LVMI (group III). There were no significant differences in LV end-diastolic pressure or volume among the three groups; the ejection fraction was slightly greater in group II (70 +/- 5%) than in groups I (65 +/- 8%) and III (66 +/- 4%), but this trend did not achieve statistical significance. Values for endocardial and conventional midwall fractional shortening (FS) were also similar in the three groups. By contrast, FS by the concentric two-shell geometry (modified midwall method) in group III (16 +/- 2%) was significantly less than that seen in groups I and II (21 +/- 4% and 21 +/- 5%, respectively; both p less than 0.05). This difference achieves greater importance when it is recognized that mean systolic circumferential stress was lower in group III (151 +/- 22 g/cm2) than in groups I and II (244 +/- 37 g/cm2 and 213 +/- 38 g/cm2, respectively; both p less than 0.01). The midwall stress-shortening coordinates in six of the seven group III patients were outside the 95% confidence limits for the normal (group I) subjects. Thus, despite a normal ejection fraction, systolic function is subnormal in hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS. Chamber dynamics provide an overestimate of myocardial function, especially when LV wall thickness is increased. This is due to a relatively greater contribution of inner shell thickening in pressure-overload hypertrophy. \nImpaired potassium-induced dilation in hypertensive rat cerebral arteries does not reflect altered Na+,K(+)-ATPase dilation. We have recently demonstrated that K(+)-induced dilation of cerebral resistance-sized vessels has two independent components, only one of which seemed sodium pump dependent. In our current investigation, potassium-induced dilation of spontaneous tone was compared in cerebral arteries from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats and age-matched stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Branches of the posterior cerebral artery were cannulated and pressurized, and these vessels developed spontaneous tone. After a 5-minute period in K(+)-free physiological saline solution, K+ was increased in 1-mM increments to a final concentration of 15 mM. In the normotensive arteries, K+ concentrations between 0 and 5 mM K+ resulted in dilations that had a transient (sodium pump-dependent) component, and K+ concentrations in excess of 7 mM produced dilations that lacked a transient (sodium pump-independent) component. Similar branches from the hypertensive rat also responded with transient dilations to K+ (less than 5 mM), and these were significantly greater at 3 mM K+. However, the maintained dilations to K+ (greater than 7 mM), noted in preparations from Wistar-Kyoto rats, were absent in seven of eight preparations. Thus, the impaired dilations, in the hypertensive vessels, to K+ described here is a consequence of altered function of some sodium pump-independent component rather than altered Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity. \nEndocarditis due to Trichosporon beigelii: in vitro susceptibility of isolates and review. Infection with Trichosporon beigelii is an uncommon cause of endocarditis. Of the eight cases of T. beigelii endocarditis that have been reported (one herein and seven previously), six involved prosthetic heart valves and two involved native heart valves. The clinical manifestations of this infection included embolization of the superficial femoral artery or of the bifurcation of the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries in three of these patients (two with prosthetic valve and one with native valve endocarditis). In seven of the eight reported cases, blood cultures were positive for the organism. Although clinical isolates of the organism are generally reported to be susceptible to amphotericin B, isolates can vary in their sensitivities to antifungal agents in vitro depending on the methodology used, and clinical response to therapy with antifungal agents in a regimen that includes amphotericin B is generally poor. Only two of six patients who were treated with antifungal agents survived endocarditis caused by T. beigelii and were apparently cured; one of these patients was also managed surgically with valve replacement. Infection with T. beigelii should be considered in the differential diagnosis of endocarditis in immunocompetent patients, particularly those who have a prosthetic heart valve. Rapid, aggressive therapy may be necessary to eradicate this organism. \nTriangulation of pedicular instrumentation. A biomechanical analysis. Tensile load-to-failure pullout tests were performed on 54 cadaveric spinal segments. The vertebrae were grouped by adjacent levels and matched for bone mineral density (g/cm2), which was measured by dual-photon absorptiometry. Triangulation of Steffee screws and CD pedicle screws was accomplished by transverse plates specifically designed to increase fixation within the same vertebra before the longitudinal Steffee plate or CD rod was applied. A transverse plate with adjustable length was also tested to accommodate variable interpedicular distances. Comparative pullout load-to-failures were as follows: laminar hook, 809 SE 99.4 N; single CD pedicular screws, 863 SE 108 N; single Steffee pedicular screw, 1245 SE 75.3 N; adjustable transverse plate, 1341 SE 114; triangulated Steffee pedicle screws with a transverse plate, 1701 SE 151 N; and triangulated CD pedicle screws with a transverse plate, 2096 SE 115 N. Three triangulated constructs with pedicle screws and a transverse plate (CD, Steffee, and Kirschner) provided significantly greater fixation than conventional pedicular or laminar hook based instrumentation systems (P less than 0.05). Improved treatment of spinal deformities in the elderly and osteoporotic population is dependent on improving the fixation at the metal-bone interface of spinal implants Particularly in osteoporotic vertebrae, the strength of fixation of two triangulated pedicle screws is better than either laminar hooks or single pedicle screws. The strength of fixation of triangulated pedicle screws connected by a transverse plate is superior to a single pedicle screw because it is dependent on the mass of bone between the screws rather than simply the amount of bone within the screw thread. \nLate follow-up after repair of left ventricular aneurysm and (usually) associated coronary bypass grafting. This study assesses clinical and operative data (LV) aneurysm was repaired to determine factors that might predict in-hospital and long-term outcome. Long-term follow-up study was obtained in 296 of 298 patients undergoing LV aneurysm repair with or without coronary artery bypass grafting between 1974 and 1986. No patient had sustained a myocardial infarction within 2 weeks of surgery or was undergoing other concurrent cardiac surgery. The average age of the study patients was 57 +/- 9 years and the average ejection fraction was 35 +/- 13%. Ninety percent of the patients underwent concurrent bypass grafting, with an average of 2.2 +/- 1.3 grafts placed. Fourteen (5%) patients died in the hospital, with most deaths attributable to LV dysfunction. Advanced age and less extensive revascularization were correlates of in-hospital mortality. The 10-year survival was 57%, myocardial infarction-free survival 43%, and freedom from death, myocardial infarction and reoperative coronary surgery 41%. Advanced age, systemic hypertension, significant left main coronary artery narrowing and emergent operative status were multivariate correlates of long-term mortality. A low-risk population was defined by the absence of these risk factors, and high-risk by the presence of greater than or equal to 1 risk factors. The 10-year survival was 71% in the low-risk and 41% in the high-risk groups (p = .0006). The 10-year myocardial infarction free survival was 55% in the low-risk and 31% in the high-risk groups (p = 0.0017). LV aneurysm repair may be performed with acceptable in-hospital mortality, and the long-term risk may be stratified. \nPericardiac extravasation during intravenous digital subtraction angiography: a case report. The authors reported a case, pericardiac extravasation of contract medium during an intravenous angiographic (IV DSA) procedure. To their knowledge this is the first such case in the literature. They suggest modifications of the IV DSA method to avoid this complication. \nRemission of hepatitis B-associated membranous glomerulonephritis in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been associated with several renal diseases, the most common being membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). The role of concurrent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in affecting the course of the renal involvement is largely unknown. We report the case of a HIV-infected adult male with chronic HBV-associated MGN who had complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome associated with spontaneous seroconversion from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive to HBeAg-negative. The present case illustrates that HIV infection does not preclude improvement of chronic HBV infection or an associated membranous nephropathy. Such improvement may be dependent on the ability of the host immune system to clear HBeAg. \nSpatial control of gut-specific gene expression during Caenorhabditis elegans development. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was transformed with constructs containing upstream deletions of the gut-specific ges-1 carboxylesterase gene. With particular deletions, ges-1 was expressed, not as normally in the gut, but rather in muscle cells of the pharynx (which belong to a sister lineage of the gut) or in body wall muscle and hypodermal cells (which belong to a cousin lineage of the gut). These observations suggest that gut-specific gene expression in C. elegans involves not only gut-specific activators but also multiple repressors that are present in particular nongut lineages. \nComplex ventricular ectopic activity in patients less than 20 years of age with or without syncope, and the role of ventricular extrastimulus testing. To assess the potential for ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular extrastimulus testing was performed in 33 young patients with complex ventricular ectopic activity defined as multiform ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), couplets or nonsustained VT, or a combination, found during electrocardiographic monitoring. There were 21 male and 12 female patients with a mean age of 11 years (range 1 to 18). Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence (14 patients) or absence (19 patients) of syncope. Patients with syncope had ostensibly normal hearts (9 patients) or miscellaneous heart disease (5 patients). Patients without syncope had ostensibly normal hearts (8 patients) or miscellaneous heart disease (11 patients). Ventricular stimulation protocol consisted of burst pacing and 1 to 4 programmed extrastimuli decreasing to refractoriness at 3 drive-train cycle lengths, and at 2 pacing sites (right ventricular apex and outflow tract) during the drug-free baseline state and isoproterenol infusion. No patient had VT induced with 1 or 2 extrastimuli. VT was induced in 13 of 14 patients (93%) with syncope, and in 9 of 19 patients (47%) without syncope (p less than 0.05). Using a 3-extrastimuli protocol, 8 of 14 patients (57%) with and 3 of 19 patients (16%) without syncope had VT induced (p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that VT may be the cause of syncope in young patients with complex ventricular ectopic activity. \nHexamethylmelamine chemotherapy for persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the activity and toxicity of hexamethylmelamine chemotherapy in patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. Forty-nine women received hexamethylmelamine 100 to 150 mg/day for 14 days, repeated at 4-week intervals. All patients had previously received at least one chemotherapy regimen, and 46 (94%) had received cisplatin. Among 25 patients with clinically measurable disease there were three complete and two partial responses, for an objective response rate of 20%. The mean progression-free interval for responders was 38.6 months versus 9.6 months for nonresponders or patients with nonmeasurable disease (p less than 0.001). Thirteen patients are alive, eight with no clinical evidence for disease. Only four patients discontinued therapy because of toxic reactions. Hexamethylmelamine appears to be a well-tolerated drug with activity against ovarian cancer previously treated with cisplatin. \nPsychiatric disorders in patients with esophageal disease. Psychiatric disorders have potentially important roles in the manifestations of esophageal disease. A primary causative role for psychiatric factors in the common motility disorders associated with chest pain (esophageal spasm and the nonspecific motor disorders) remains unproven, but psychiatric disorders appear particularly prevalent in this group. In most other esophageal diseases, psychiatric factors interact through recognized psychophysiologic or behavioral mechanisms to affect the clinical presentation. Recognizing the possible levels of interaction has significant therapeutic implications. \nHearing aid prescribing: is the specialist opinion necessary? A restructuring of the service for provision of hearing aids has been proposed by the Royal National Institute for the Deaf. This is based on the assumption that very few patients referred for hearing aids have significant ear disease and it is not necessary for them to see an ENT specialist. The case notes of 200 consecutive patients referred to the Hearing Aid clinic were reviewed. In only half of these would a hearing aid have been prescribed without a specialist opinion. The remainder either did not need a hearing aid or required further investigation and surgical or medical treatment. In addition there was significant evidence of lack of expertise amongst General Practitioners in recognizing ear disorders. It is imperative that any patient requiring a hearing aid be seen by someone experienced in otology rather than be dealt with by the General Practitioner alone. \nEarly thrombolytic treatment reduces analgesic requirement in patients with myocardial infarction. The duration and amount of analgesics required were investigated in 67 patients with myocardial infarction treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) or placebo in a randomized double-blind trial. Infusion of rtPA (100 mg)/placebo was started within 5 h after the onset of symptoms, and the requirement for analgesics during the following 48 h was recorded. Sixty-seven per cent of the 30 rtPA-treated patients required analgesic treatment for less than 6 h, compared to 38% of the 37 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.04). During the study period, patients in the rtPA group used the equivalent of 5.3 mg (median value) intravenous morphine, which was significantly less than the 11.2 mg used in the placebo group (P = 0.04). In conclusion, the present study suggests that early thrombolysis with intravenous rtPA reduces the amount and duration of analgesic treatment required by patients with myocardial infarction. \nImmediate and late inflammatory responses to ragweed antigen challenge of the peripheral airways in allergic asthmatics. Cellular, mediator, and permeability changes. Asthma may represent the clinical manifestations of a unique form of chronic airway inflammation and is often associated with allergy. To better define the components of allergic inflammation in the lung, fluids obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were examined for cells, inflammatory mediators, and markers of airway permeability 5 min and 19 h following instillation of ragweed antigen directly into an airway segment of allergic asthmatic subjects. The 5-min response to antigen challenge (n = 10) was characterized by 17- to 208-fold increases in histamine, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and its metabolite, 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2, thromboxane B2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha compared with a saline-challenged segment (0.004 less than p less than 0.017). The increases in most of these mediators were significantly correlated with each other (0.0001 less than p less than or equal to 0.01), and the magnitude of all significant mediator increases was directly correlated with skin test sensitivity to ragweed antigen (0.007 less than or equal to p less than or equal to 0.05). There was also a slight increase in kinins (p = 0.04). Changes in cells and airway permeability were not detected. In contrast, the 19-h response to antigen challenge (n = 9) was characterized by a 13-fold increase in total cells recovered by BAL. Eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes were significantly increased and comprised 38, 1, and 9% of total cells, respectively. A neutrophil influx was also observed but was not specific for antigen challenge since a similar change was observed in a sham, saline-challenged site. \nAntiischemic and metabolic effects of glutamate during pacing in patients with stable angina pectoris secondary to either coronary artery disease or syndrome X. The effects of glutamate on anginal threshold, cardiac metabolism and hemodynamics were studied in 11 patients with stable angina pectoris, positive stress test results, and pacing-induced myocardial lactate release due to coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 9) or syndrome X (n = 2). Data were obtained before, during and after 2 identical periods of coronary sinus pacing, the second being preceded by an intravenous injection of monosodium glutamate 1.2 (n = 7) or 2.5 (n = 4) mg/kg body weight. After glutamate administration, pacing time to onset of angina increased from mean +/- standard deviation 103 +/- 53 to 166 +/- 71 seconds (p less than 0.01) and ST-segment depression after pacing decreased from 2.3 +/- 1.0 to 1.6 +/- 1.1 mm (p less than 0.01). Arterial glutamate concentration increased 60% (p less than 0.01) after the low dose and 150% (p less than 0.01) after the high dose of glutamate. Regardless of dose, myocardial glutamate uptake increased by 25% (p less than 0.01). Pacing-induced cardiac release of lactate diminished 50% (p less than 0.05), whereas the releases of xanthine and hypoxanthine were unchanged by glutamate. Arterial free fatty acids decreased 20% (p less than 0.01). Circulating levels and cardiac exchanges of alanine, glucose and citrate were unchanged. Glutamate did not influence heart rate, arterial blood pressure, coronary blood flow, coronary vascular resistance or myocardial oxygen consumption. One patient complained of short-lasting burning sensations after receiving the high glutamate dose. In conclusion, augmented provision of glutamate enhances pacing tolerance in stable angina, presumably by a metabolic improvement of cardiac energy production during ischemia. \nOxygen utilization, carbon dioxide elimination and ventilation during recovery from supine bicycle exercise 6 to 8 weeks after acute myocardial infarction. The pattern of oxygen (O2) consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide (CO2) production (VCO2), ventilatory and metabolic responses during and in recovery from supine bicycle exercise was examined in 18 patients with recent myocardial infarction. An increase in VO2 with increasing work load was accomplished by proportional increases in both cardiac output and the arteriovenous O2 difference. During recovery, however, the arteriovenous O2 difference rapidly decreased below levels at rest, whereas VO2 and cardiac output remained elevated, indicating that VO2 during recovery further depended on relatively high cardiac output. The ratio of VCO2 to VO2 further increased after exercise, suggesting that such cardiac output contributed to the remaining high CO2 flow to the lung and therefore enhanced ventilation. Increased arterial catecholamines during exercise remained elevated for the first 5 minutes of recovery. Arterial lactate during this period continued to increase and resulted in profound metabolic acidosis, causing alveolar hyperventilation after exercise. These results suggest that during recovery from exercise, cardiopulmonary responses remain enhanced because of continuing high cardiac output, resulting in subsequent high CO2 flow to the lung and metabolic acidosis, and that this may be associated with profound fatigue or dyspnea after exercise. \nLipoprotein (a) blood levels in unstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, and after thrombolytic therapy. Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] appears to be involved in atherogenesis and in vitro studies have suggested that it may interfere with thrombolysis. In this study, Lp(a) serum levels were determined by radioimmunoassay in 124 patients with ischemic heart disease. Of these, 47 had acute myocardial infarction, 13 had unstable angina, and 64 were age-matched patients with stable angina. Of the 60 patients with acute coronary artery disease, 34 received thrombolysis and 26 did not. In addition to Lp(a), serum plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer (cross-linked fibrin degradation products) levels were measured. These tests were repeated after 6 hours in patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina. No significant difference was found for admission Lp(a) levels among patients with myocardial infarction (0.324 +/- 0.047 g/liter), unstable angina (0.435 +/- 0.123 g/liter) and stable angina (0.431 +/- 0.023 g/liter), between patients with myocardial infarction with or without thrombolytic treatment, nor between late and early measurements in patients with unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. Plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin and fibrinogen values decreased significantly after thrombolytic treatment. The size of this decrease correlated positively with higher Lp(a) blood levels (p less than 0.05). Patients with Lp(a) greater than 0.25 g/liter had a 66% decrease in fibrinogen and a 53% decrease in anti-plasmin, compared with 35 and 32%, respectively, in patients with Lp(a) level less than or equal to 0.25 g/liter (p less than 0.05). Plasminogen levels revealed a similar trend, with a 61% decrease for the higher values and a 45% decrease for the lower values. \nOrthotopic liver transplantation, Epstein-Barr virus, cyclosporine, and lymphoproliferative disease: a growing concern. Lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) is a well-recognized complication of both solid organ and bone marrow transplantations. The occurrence of LPD in these settings is related in part to the use of the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine. We report 12 cases of LPD after orthotopic liver transplantations in 132 pediatric patients. Lymphoproliferative disease occurred as one of three clinical syndromes: (1) lymphadenopathic, (2) systemic, and (3) lymphomatous. Effective management of LPD with excisional therapy or reduction of immunosuppressive medications or both resulted in the survival of 7 of 12 patients. In an alarming and increasing percentage of patients after orthotopic liver transplantation, progressive LPD develops with lethal outcome (5/12 patients). Early recognition of LPD and aggressive intervention may improve outcome in this group. \nCoffee, coronary heart disease and mortality in middle-aged Swedish men: findings from the Primary Prevention Study. The effect of coffee consumption on the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) was studied prospectively in a population sample of 6765 men aged 51-59 years at baseline during the period 1974-1977, and free of myocardial infarction (MI) prior to the screening. During a 7.1-year follow-up there were 230 non-fatal myocardial infarctions. 169 coronary deaths and 478 deaths from all causes. Among men who were smokers at baseline there was no relationship between either non-fatal MI or death from CHD, and coffee consumption. Among non-smokers, a weak but far from significant trend towards an increasing incidence of CHD in heavy consumers of coffee was observed. There was an inverse relationship between mortality from all causes and coffee consumption. \nDietary lipid predictors of coronary heart disease in men. The Framingham Study. The relationship between dietary lipids and the 16-year incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality was examined in two male cohorts, aged 45 to 55 years (n = 420) and 56 to 65 years (n = 393) from the Framingham Study. Dietary lipids were assessed through a single 24-hour recall at the initiation of follow-up in 1966 to 1969. In the younger cohort, there were significant positive associations between the incidence of CHD and the proportion of dietary energy intake from total fat and monounsaturated fatty acids. The proportion of energy intake from saturated fatty acids had a marginally significant positive association with CHD. The associations remained even after adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, including serum cholesterol level, suggesting that their effects are at least partially independent of other established risk factors. In contrast to the younger cohort, none of the dietary lipids were associated with CHD in the older cohort. Dietary intervention for the prevention of CHD in younger men is supported by these findings. \nPill-esophagitis caused by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. A case of meclofenamate-induced pill-esophagitis is reported, and the relevant literature is reviewed. The role of posture, amount of fluid chaser, esophageal obstruction or dysmotility, drug formulation, physical and chemical properties of the drug, and concomitant ingestion of alcohol, as well as the diagnosis and management of such cases, are discussed. \nIncrease in atherosclerosis and adventitial mast cells in cocaine abusers: an alternative mechanism of cocaine-associated coronary vasospasm and thrombosis. Coronary vasospasm has been implicated as a cause of myocardial ischemia and sudden cardiac death in cocaine abusers. However, the mechanism or mechanisms remain unknown. Autopsy records (n = 5,871) from the medical examiner's files at Baltimore, Maryland and northern Virginia were examined and 495 persons (8.4%) were identified with positive toxicologic findings for cocaine. Of these, six subjects (1.2%) had total thrombotic occlusion, involving primarily the left anterior descending coronary artery. The mean number of adventitial mast cells per coronary segment and the degree of atherosclerosis were determined. These observations were compared with findings in age- and gender-matched subjects who died from cocaine overdose and in patients who had sudden cardiac death (acute thrombosis) without a history of illicit drug abuse. There were significantly more mast cells in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis than in the other groups. The number of mast cells showed a significant correlat",
