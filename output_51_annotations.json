        "text": "erative site in 1.2% of patients given a regimen including aztreonam and in 4.7% of those given a regimen including cefotaxime; the difference between the two groups was not significant. Neither were significant differences observed in the incidence of fever, the incidence of bacteriuria, the need for postoperative antibiotics, or the duration of postoperative hospitalization, although results were slightly better for patients receiving clindamycin plus aztreonam. Following vaginal hysterectomy, slightly but not significantly better results for the same parameters were obtained in the group given clindamycin plus cefotaxime. Diarrhea was the only adverse reaction attributable to antibiotic treatment and occurred more frequently in patients given cefotaxime. It was concluded that the two regimens were similarly effective and safe in preventing infections following hysterectomy. \nPost-sclerotherapy bacterial peritonitis. Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy has been associated with a number of complications. Peritonitis after sclerotherapy has rarely been reported. In this retrospective review of 213 consecutive sclerotherapy procedures among 65 patients over a 3-yr period, we found that six cases of peritonitis occurred, for an incidence of approximately 3%. All patients developing post-sclerotherapy peritonitis had low ascitic fluid protein. However, this did not differ from patients who did not develop peritonitis. No patient on antibiotics at the time of sclerotherapy developed peritonitis. Peritonitis should be considered in the diagnosis of post-sclerotherapy fever. The role of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent this complication is uncertain. \nRenal atrophy or infarction in children with neuroblastoma. Twelve children with adrenal or upper abdominal paraaortic neuroblastoma developed unilateral or bilateral renal atrophy or infarction. At presentation, the children ranged in age from 2 weeks to 9.7 years. Neuroblastomas were stage II (n = 1), III (n = 2), IV-S (n = 2), and IV (n = 7). Treatment varied but included surgery, chemotherapy, localized abdominal irradiation, and/or bone marrow transplantation. Six children developed ipsilateral renal atrophy, five experienced ipsilateral or bilateral acute perioperative renal infarction, and one developed contralateral renal infarction unrelated to surgery. During treatment, two patients required hemodialysis; both subsequently died. Creatinine concentrations in eight patients have been in the normal range. Two patients have had mildly but persistently elevated creatinine levels. Renal damage from primary effects of the tumor can develop in children with adrenal or upper abdominal neuroblastoma. Treatment, especially surgical resection of the primary tumor, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, can compound such damage. \nPrognostic factors in childhood acute encephalitis. We have studied the prognostic factors in 462 children, from 1 month to 16 years old, with acute encephalitis. Death occurred in 2.8% patients, 6.7% were severely damaged and 90.5% were cured with no or only minor sequelae. The risk of death or severe damage in patients less than 1 year of age was 5.0-fold (95% confidence limits, 2.2 to 11.6; P less than 0.001) greater than that of older children. When compared with those children whose level of consciousness had been normal before admission, children who had been disoriented before admission had a 3.9-fold (1.1 to 14.3, P less than 0.05) risk and those who had been unconscious had a 25.4-fold (7.3 to 88.1, P less than 0.001) greater risk of death or severe damage. The risk of death or severe damage in patients with herpes simplex virus encephalitis was 11.7-fold (3.8 to 35.8, P less than 0.001) and in patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis it was 7.0-fold (2.6 to 18.7, P less than 0.001) that of other children. All patients with none of the above mentioned risk factors were cured without any major sequelae. We conclude that specific attention should be paid to the youngest patients, especially to those with an impaired level of consciousness, and all available measures should be focused on early detection of herpes simplex virus or M. pneumoniae infection. \nMetastases of a gastric adenocarcinoma presenting as colonic polyposis. Report of a case. The authors report a case of multiple colonic metastases of a gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, presenting as colonic polyposis revealed by diarrhea, iron deficiency anemia, and left supraclavicular lymph node. \nThe induction and maintenance of central sensitization is dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor activation; implications for the treatment of post-injury pain hypersensitivity states. Repetitive stimulation of small diameter primary afferent fibres produces a progressive increase in action potential discharge (windup) and a prolonged increase in the excitability of neurones in the spinal cord following the stimulus. Previous studies have demonstrated that windup is the consequence of the temporal summation of slow synaptic potentials and that the slow potentials and windup are reduced by pretreatment with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists. We have now examined whether primary afferent induced hypersensitivity states in flexor motoneurones are also dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors and whether windup is a possible trigger for the production of the central hypersensitivity. Both a non-competitive (MK-801) and a competitive (D-CPP) NMDA antagonist, at doses that did not modify the baseline reflex, reduced the facilitation of the flexor reflex produced by either brief electrical stimulation of the sural nerve (1 Hz for 20 sec at C-fibre strength), or by the cutaneous application of the chemical irritant mustard oil. These antagonists also prevented windup from occurring in the motoneurones. When the the MK-801 and the D-CPP were administered once a state of central facilitation had been induced by prior treatment with mustard oil, they returned the facilitated reflex to its pretreatment level. These results indicate that NMDA receptors are involved in the induction and maintenance of the central sensitization produced by high threshold primary afferent inputs. Because central sensitization is likely to contribute to the post-injury pain hypersensitivity states in man, these data have a bearing both on the potential role of NMDA antagonists for pre-emptive analgesia and for treating established pain states. \nC terminus of the small GTP-binding protein smg p25A contains two geranylgeranylated cysteine residues and a methyl ester. smg p25A, also known as the rab3A protein, is a small GTP-binding protein that has been implicated in intracellular vesicle transport and the secretion of neurotransmitters. It has been shown to bind reversibly to membranes, though its cDNA-predicted sequence contains no obvious membrane-binding domains. However, smg p25A does contain a cDNA-predicted C-terminal Cys-Ala-Cys sequence at positions 218 through 220, which suggests that it may be posttranslationally modified. In the present study we used two different approaches to investigate this possibility. First, we incubated pheochromocytoma cells with [3H]mevalonolactone, examined the proteins that became labeled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and demonstrated that two of these proteins exactly corresponded to smg p25A. Second, we purified smg p25A from bovine brain membranes and analyzed both the full-length protein and a proteolytically derived C-terminal peptide by a combination of high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This approach revealed that the protein's C-terminal region is methyl-esterified and contains two geranylgeranyl groups linked via thioether bonds to Cys-218 and Cys-220. Since smg p25A is one of several small GTP-binding proteins that share a C-terminal Cys-Xaa-Cys consensus sequence (where Xaa is an unspecified amino acid), our results suggest that these proteins may be similarly geranylgeranylated and methyl-esterified. \nPericardial haemorrhage causing right atrial compression after cardiac surgery: role of transoesophageal echocardiography. After cardiac surgery transoesophageal echocardiography showed a large thrombus compressing the right atrium in three hypotensive patients. No satisfactory images were obtained by transthoracic imaging, which is often difficult in ventilated patients after cardiac surgery. Transoesophageal echocardiography, however, provided rapid diagnostic information and permitted prompt surgical intervention. \nImpact of diagnosis-related groups on the quality of postoperative care of patients with neck dissections. Two hundred eighty patients underwent neck dissection over a 10-year period: 138 during the 5-year period before the institution of Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) reimbursement and 142 during the 5 years after DRG regulations. A comparison of these two groups by site of tumor, stage of disease, histopathology, previous treatment, type of neck dissection, whether neck dissection was carried out alone or in combination with another procedure, presence of preexisting disease, postoperative complications, and mortality revealed no significant differences. A 35% reduction in the length of hospital stay from 16 to 10 days was identified in the post-DRG group with no detrimental effects on patient care. The variables found to have the greatest impact on length of hospital stay were the extent of operation and postoperative complications. \nMonomorphous histiocytoma in a child. Report of a case with ultrastructural features suggestive of dendritic cell differentiation. The authors describe a rapidly growing soft tissue tumor of predominantly histiocytic composition in an 8-year-old child. The tumor cells were identified as elements of the mononuclear phagocyte system by histologic, histochemical, immunologic, and electron microscopic study. Despite the presence of a minor fibroblastic component, the tumor did not conform to established criteria for a diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Formation of frequent desmosome-like intercellular junctions raised the possibility of dendritic reticulum cell differentiation, since the latter cells seem to be the only elements of the mononuclear phagocyte system that display such specialized cell junctions. The results of immunostaining were discrepant with those reported for normal dendritic reticulum cells, but the currently available information makes it doubtful that the entire neoplastic spectrum of dendritic cell differentiation can currently be diagnosed in surgical pathology. \nEffects of a meal on hemodynamic function at rest and during exercise in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy experience postprandial exacerbation of their symptoms. The vasodilation associated with eating may be deleterious in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, especially during exercise. To examine the hemodynamic effects of a meal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 11 patients were studied with invasive hemodynamic monitoring during exercise testing in the fasting state and 45 min after a 740 kcal (3,100 J) meal. The meal induced a decrease in systemic vascular resistance index at rest (mean +/- SD, -17 +/- 14%), increases in mean right atrial (31 +/- 21%), mean pulmonary artery (14 +/- 14%) and mean pulmonary capillary wedge (17 +/- 14%) pressures and an increase in cardiac index (18 +/- 10%) due to an increased heart rate without any significant change in stroke volume. During postprandial exercise, heart rate, rate-pressure product, cardiac index and cardiac filling pressures were higher than during fasting exercise and one patient had a decrease in exercise blood pressure compared with the fasting test. Five patients with postprandial exacerbation of symptoms in everyday life had a lesser increase in systemic arterial pressure and stroke volume during both exercise tests and a smaller increase in cardiac index after the meal than did the six patients without postprandial symptom exacerbation, suggesting more severe cardiac disease. It is concluded that patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have an abnormal hemodynamic response to food, in which stroke volume fails to increase and pulmonary capillary wedge and pulmonary artery pressures increase. These adverse changes persist during postprandial exercise and may predispose to exertional collapse in certain patients. \nOptimum concentration of bupivacaine for combined caudal--general anesthesia in children. Caudal epidural anesthesia has become widely accepted as a means of providing postoperative pain relief and intraoperative supplementation to general anesthesia for children. To determine the best concentration of bupivacaine for combined general-caudal anesthesia in children, 122 children aged 1-8 yr scheduled for outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphy were randomized to receive, in a double-blind fashion, caudal anesthesia with bupivacaine in one of six concentrations (0.125, 0.15, 0.175, 0.2, 0.225, or 0.25%). After incision, a programmed reduction in inspired halothane resulted, if tolerated by the subject, in an inspired halothane concentration of 0.5% 10 min after incision. End-tidal halothane concentration at hernia sac ligation for subjects receiving 0.175% bupivacaine (0.55 +/- 0.03%) was less than that for subjects receiving 0.15% bupivacaine (0.75 +/- 0.05%; P less than 0.05). Subjects receiving 0.175% bupivacaine also were discharged earlier from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (27 +/- 1 min) than were subjects receiving 0.15% bupivacaine (38 +/- 5 min; P = 0.05). Children receiving greater than or equal to 0.2% bupivacaine tended to complain more of leg weakness after surgery; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (39 of 67 vs. 16 of 47; P = 0.057). The incidence of complaints of leg weakness and paresthesia was positively correlated with bupivacaine concentration (r = 0.706; P = 0.05). Subjects receiving 0.125% bupivacaine had higher pain scores on arrival to the PACU than did those receiving 0.2% bupivacaine (P = 0.05); there were no other differences in pain scores. \nFunctional and urodynamic characteristics of bladder substitution with detubularised right colonic segment. A total of 19 patients underwent bladder replacement with a detubularised right colonic segment; 14 males underwent complete substitution after cystoprostatectomy and 5 females had augmentation after subtotal cystectomy. The mean follow-up time was 20 months. Urodynamic evaluation showed a low pressure reservoir with a mean capacity of 580 ml and normal closure pressure. Sensitivity of the bladder to cold was normal in the augmentation group but was lacking in all patients in the total substitution group. In all except 1 patient the neobladder emptied effectively upon straining without significant residual urine. Seventeen patients were completely continent by day and 10 by night; 1 patient developed hyperchloraemic acidosis requiring treatment. Bladder substitution is superior to the standard ileal or colonic conduits with regard to quality of life, and the use of a right colonic segment is functionally comparable with neobladders composed of the ileum or a combination of the right colon and ileum. The latter are more difficult to fabricate and so may have more complications. \nEffect of cisapride on delayed gastric emptying in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease have delayed gastric emptying. This study investigates the effect of cisapride on gastric emptying in 34 patients with proved reflux and delayed gastric emptying of solids. They were enrolled in a double blind controlled crossover study. Placebo or cisapride (10 mg) tablets were given three times a day for three days followed by further assessment of gastric emptying. The protocol was repeated with the crossover tablet. Gastric emptying was assessed by a dual radionuclide technique. The percentage of a solid meal remaining in the stomach at 100 minutes (% R100 minutes) and the time taken for 50% of the liquid to empty (T50 minutes) were calculated and analysed by the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test and expressed as medians (ranges). For gastric emptying of solids the initial % R100 minutes (70 (60-100)%) was not significantly different from placebo (71 (35-100)%). After cisapride treatment a significant acceleration (p less than 0.001) in gastric emptying occurred (% R100 minutes, 50.5 (28-93)%). Similarly with gastric emptying of liquids, the initial T50 minute value was 26.5 (12-82) minutes, after placebo the value was 28 (11-81) minutes, but this was significantly accelerated with cisapride (p less than 0.03) to 22.5 (6-61) minutes. The acceleration in gastric emptying occurred in the proximal portion of the stomach for gastric emptying of both solids and liquids suggesting that this is the principal site of action of cisapride. We conclude that cisapride significantly accelerates gastric emptying of both solids and liquids in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and delayed gastric emptying. \nMyelin splitting in the spongy lesion in Leigh encephalopathy. A spongy lesion consists of numerous vacuoles, mainly in the central gray matter, and is a characteristic finding in subacute necrotizing encephalopathy (Leigh encephalopathy); the cause of this lesion is unknown. An ultrastructural study on the vacuolated lesions in the left putamen of a patient with subacute necrotizing encephalopathy due to a deficiency of mitochondrial enzyme complexes I and IV revealed that the vacuoles were formed through the splitting of myelin. Because myelin splitting is commonly caused by toxic or metabolic diseases in humans and experimental animals, we believe that the vacuolation was due to the splitting of myelin which was caused by abnormal mitochondrial metabolism, even though this lesion is most commonly found in the white matter. We do not know whether the spongy lesion is formed only through myelin splitting in patients with subacute necrotizing encephalopathy; however, myelin splitting must play an important role in the formation of the spongy lesion. \nDepression and fatigue in the primary care physician. Fatigue is a symptom that is found in a variety of psychiatric disorders. The nature of a physician's life may foster such symptoms that can be either a reaction to work or a sign of an emotional disorder. This article summarizes various developmental stages that can lead to such problems. These difficulties may also be found in the physician's family and can be easily overlooked. \nProlonged QT interval and risk of sudden death in South-East Asian men. Sudden death in sleep occurs in substantial numbers among young men in South-East Asia. The frequencies of electrocardiographic abnormalities were measured in groups with varying risks of such sudden death. The mean heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater among 123 Laotian refugees in Thailand at high risk (405 [95% confidence interval 397-413] ms) than in 77 Laotian refugees in the United States at lower risk (364 [359-369] ms) and 199 non-Asian US residents at negligible risk (358 [354-362] ms). Among refugees in Thailand, prolonged QTc interval was associated with poor thiamine status and a history of seizure-like episodes in sleep. Thiamine deficiency may be a cause of prolonged QT interval and sudden death in this region. \nMR imaging in hydatid disease. Hydatid cysts may develop anywhere in the body as a result of the presence of a viable parasite (Echinococcus granulosus). Depending on the condition of the parasite, the host reaction, and therapy, the hydatid cyst will degenerate and may eventually collapse, leaving an area of calcification in the host tissue. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to demonstrate the use of MR imaging in the diagnosis of the various stages of hydatid disease and in monitoring response to therapy. \nNucleokinesis: distinct pattern of cell translocation in response to an autocrine motility factor-like substance or fibronectin [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Aug 15;88(16):7456] Human lung adenocarcinoma cells develop bipolar shape with prominent pseudopodia (greater than or equal to 200 microns) when cultured in the presence of autocrine motility factor (AMF)-like substance or on fibronectin-coated substrata. AMF was partially purified from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line and has a peak biological activity at a molecular mass of 67 kDa. Using time-lapse photography, we observed that during AMF- or fibronectin-induced cell translocation, the nuclei of some bipolar cells are transported to the opposite end of the cell, while gross cell shape and position remain unchanged. Following this nuclear movement, which we call \"nucleokinesis,\" the posterior pseudopodium is retracted behind the nucleus. Thus, extension of a pseudopodium followed by nucleokinesis in the same direction and retraction of the cell body behind the nucleus is a normal motile sequence in translocating bipolar cells. This suggests that nucleokinesis is a distinct step in whole-cell translocation of bipolar cells on biological substrata and that pseudopodia can be used as nuclear transport organs. In contrast, adenocarcinoma cells cultured on artificial substrata and in the absence of AMF display a fibroblast-like motility pattern with the nucleus centrally located within the migrating cell. \nClinical and electrodiagnostic features of X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy. We describe four men from two kinships affected with X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy, and one sporadic case. All developed postural tremor, weakness, and fasciculations, with onset from age 25 to 39 years. Weakness began in the pelvic girdle or hands, with dysphagia or dysarthria occurring years later in two. Sensory symptoms were present in only one, who also had diabetes mellitus. In contrast, sural nerve action potentials were small or absent in all. Needle EMG showed widespread chronic partial denervation with reinnervation. The characteristic twitching of the chin produced by pursing of the lips consisted of repetitive or grouped motor unit discharges, rather than fasciculations. Broader awareness of the distinctive features of bulbospinal neuronopathy will probably increase the frequency of its recognition. Diagnosis is important for purposes of providing a prognosis for affected men and genetic counseling for affected families. \nUse of albumin as a volume expander. In some hospitals, albumin products account for 10% of the pharmaceutical budget. As much as 60% of these prescriptions are empiric, and from 40 to 70% of albumin that is administered is given for inappropriate reasons. Although the reasons for albumin administration vary, prevention or reversal of hypovolemia is part of the reason in the majority of cases. \nVenous obstruction: an analysis of one hundred thirty-seven cases with hemodynamic, venographic, and clinical correlations. One hundred thirty-seven limbs with venous obstruction were analyzed. The arm/foot venous pressure differential and reactive hyperemia tests were found to be useful techniques to diagnose and grade venous obstruction. Traditional techniques including venography and ambulatory venous pressure are inferior in this regard. The newer techniques have provided newer insights in venous obstruction which are detailed herein. The hand-held Doppler was surprisingly very sensitive in grade I as well as in more severe forms of obstruction. Neither anatomic locale of obstruction nor its extent determined hemodynamic severity. Extensive proximal lesions could be hemodynamically mild, and conversely distal crural obstructions and single segment lesions could be hemodynamically severe. Phlebographic appearance was a poor index of collateralization. The paradoxical venous pressure response to the reactive hyperemia test in grade IV obstruction was found to be due to suppression or delay of the reactive hyperemia response itself in the presence of severe venous obstruction. The pain of venous claudication may be related to this phenomenon. Skin ulceration in the presence of venous obstruction was related to the associated reflux rather than the hemodynamic severity of the obstruction itself. The Linton procedure was found to be useful in treating such skin ulcerations. After perforator disruption, obstruction did not become hemodynamically worse, but reflux as measured by the Valsalva test improved with ulcer healing. The improvement in reflux related to Valsalva offers for the first time a hemodynamic rationale for the Linton procedure. \nEpidemiology of acute respiratory infections in children of developing countries. Acute respiratory infections cause four and a half million deaths among children every year, the overwhelming majority occurring in developing countries. Pneumonia unassociated with measles causes 70% of these deaths; post-measles pneumonia, 15%; pertussis, 10%; and bronchiolitis and croup syndromes, 5%. Both bacterial and viral pathogens are responsible for these deaths. The most important bacterial agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The data on bacterial etiology of pneumonia during the first 3 months of life are limited, and almost no information on the role of chlamydia and pertussis in this age period is available. The distribution of viral pathogens in developing countries can be summarized as follows: respiratory syncytial virus, 15%-20%; parainfluenza viruses, 7%-10%; and influenza A and B viruses and adenovirus, 2%-4%. Mixed viral and bacterial infections occur frequently. Risk factors that increase the incidence and severity of lower respiratory infection in developing countries include large family size, lateness in the birth order, crowding, low birth weight, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, lack of breast feeding, pollution, and young age. Effective interventions for prevention and medical case management are urgently needed to save the lives of many children predisposed to severe disease. \nPrevention of anastomosis leakage: an artificial connective tissue. Anastomosis leakage still causes considerable morbidity and mortality after digestive tract surgery. We report here our experience of the use of reconstituted connective tissue created from elastin, fibronectin and collagen in preventing anastomosis leakage and closing intestinal fistulas. In animal studies (56 rats), this connective tissue was used as a patch applied with fibrin sealant to the edges of a 1 cm diameter colonic defect. In a clinical evaluation, eight patients had an intestinal fistula closed by a simple sewn suture reinforced by a sealed patch and seven patients had a high risk anastomosis reinforced by a sealed patch, in most cases as an alternative to staged surgery. In animal studies, complete reconstitution of the three colonic layers was obtained without retraction and without inflammatory reaction within 40 days, while the patch was slowly resorbed. In clinical trials all 15 defects and anastomoses healed without complication. Three patients died from other causes and, at autopsy, the patch was found to have remained in place covering the suture line. If these results are confirmed by a prospective clinical trial, such biomaterial offers the possibility of reducing the occurrence of anastomosis leakage, especially in high risk circumstances. \nElective versus emergency cesarean hysterectomy cases in a residency program setting: a review of 129 cases from 1984 to 1988. A retrospective study was performed to compare elective versus emergency cesarean hysterectomy in a residency program. We noted the following statistically significant differences between emergency and elective cases: (1) Estimated blood loss (mean +/- SD) for emergency and elective cases was significantly different at 1495 +/- 772 and 875 +/- 396 ml (p = 0.001). (2) Operative time in emergency cases was significantly longer than in elective cases (105 +/- 38 vs 83 +/- 27 minutes, p = 0.003). (3) The incidence of transfusion was 68% in our emergency cases and 14.6% in the elective series (p less than 0.05). (4) Febrile morbidity in our series was 40% in emergency cases and 18.3% in elective cases (p less than 0.05). Our series was comparable to previous series reported. Our experience suggests that cesarean hysterectomy can be performed safely in a residency training program when done as an elective procedure in the well-prepared patient. \nCardiovascular effects of volatile anesthesia in rabbits: influence of chronic heart failure and enalaprilat treatment. Circulatory responses to isoflurane and halothane anesthesia were studied in eight rabbits with biventricular cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (Adriamycin, 14 mg/kg IV over 7 wk) and in eight controls (saline injections). In preliminary operations pulsed-Doppler flow probes were placed on the ascending aorta, left renal artery, and lower abdominal aorta. Each group was studied after 4, 6, and 7 wk of treatment. The development of congestive heart failure (CHF) was associated with decreases in mean arterial pressure and cardiac output (CO) of 14% and 16%, respectively, (P less than 0.05) and an increase in heart rate. In controls, each anesthetic agent produced dose-related decreases in mean arterial pressure and increases in heart rate, but not significant changes in CO. Renal blood flow was reduced to a similar degree by 1.3 MAC halothane (24% decrease) and 1.3 MAC isoflurane (21% decrease); hindlimb blood flow was reduced only by halothane. As CHF developed there was an attenuation of the heart rate response to anesthesia. Halothane, but not isoflurane, significantly reduced CO in more advanced stages of CHF. The changes in renal blood flow and hindlimb blood flow with each anesthetic in the CHF group were similar to those observed in controls and did not vary with week of treatment. Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (0.2 mg/kg IV) reversed the CO and renal blood flow effects of halothane except after 7 wk of treatment in the CHF group, when the combination of halothane and enalaprilat resulted in severe circulatory depression. \nDilatation of ascending aorta in patients with repaired coarctation. The long-term outcome following repair of typical aortic coarctation in adulthood may be complicated by disorders of the ascending aorta. Follow-up averaging 15 years revealed a 3.8% incidence of dilatation of the ascending aorta after such late repair. Hypertension and concomitant aortic valvular disease were common in these patients. Aortic dilatation can appear years after coarctation repair, irrespective of the operative technique and its success, and can lead to death from aortic dissection or rupture of an aortic aneurysm. Careful follow-up after coarctation repair in adulthood is advisable to detect late aortic complications. \nMulticenter study of superficial bladder cancer treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin or adriamycin. Results of long-term follow-up. We evaluated 158 cases of patients with superficial bladder cancers (Stages Ta, T1, and Tis). These cases were treated with either intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Tice strain) or Adriamycin (ADR), in a multicenter, nonrandomized study. One hundred thirty-one of these patients were followed up; the results continue to show a higher percentage of initial complete remissions with BCG (68%) than with ADR (57%). With additional therapy, both BCG and ADR achieved complete remission in 83 percent of the patients. When 7 failures with patients taking ADR were switched to BCG and the disease cleared, the rate of complete remission for BCG rose to 85 percent. The recurrence rate per 100 patient-months was only slightly different for BCG (0.9) and ADR (0.8). The percentage of progressions continued to be higher for BCG (8%) than for ADR (5%). Cystectomies were performed in 2.5 percent of the BCG patients. Using the Cox regression model with covariates, we found drug treatment, tumor grade, and sex to be statistically significant in determining failures throughout the protocol. Although both BCG and ADR were effective over the course of the study, BCG is the drug of choice for residual tumor (Stages T1 and Tis). \nChronic morphine therapy for cancer pain: plasma and cerebrospinal fluid morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide concentrations. Morphine-6-glucuronide (M-6-G) is an active metabolite that may contribute to the clinical effects produced by systemic administration of morphine. To help clarify the extent to which M-6-G may cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects, we employed high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection to measure the concentrations of M-6-G and morphine in the plasma and either ventricular (three patients) or lumbar (eight patients) CSF of cancer patients receiving chronic morphine therapy. The mean ratio of morphine in ventricular CSF:morphine in plasma was 0.71; the same ratio for M-6-G was only 0.077. The average molar ratio of M-6-G: morphine in ventricular CSF was 0.207, and the average molar ratio in plasma was 1.89. Although sampling problems render the lumbar CSF results less reliable, they were very similar. Thus, plasma contained approximately twice as much M-6-G as morphine, whereas CSF contained only one-fifth to one-third as much. These data confirm that M-6-G in plasma is distributed into CSF, but to a far lesser extent than morphine. They help explain animal data demonstrating much higher potency of M-6-G on administration into CSF than systemic administration and indicate that the degree to which M-6-G contributes to morphine effects in humans remains an unresolved question. \nAscitic fluid pH and lactate: insensitive and nonspecific tests in detecting ascitic fluid infection. Ascitic fluid pH and lactate concentration have been proposed as useful tests for the detection of ascitic fluid infection. However, past studies involved small numbers of infected patients, and all did not use optimal culture techniques. This large study was performed using highly sensitive culture methods and sought (a) to compare the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of pH and lactate to that of the ascitic fluid neutrophil count and (b) to determine whether evaluation of ascitic fluid pH or lactate (or arterial-ascitic fluid pH or lactate gradient) would result in improved decision-making regarding empirical treatment of suspected ascitic fluid infection. Analysis of 206 ascitic fluid specimens obtained in 175 patients, including 101 infected specimens, revealed that ascitic fluid (or arterial-ascitic fluid) pH and lactate were less than 50% sensitive in detecting bacterial peritonitis and that these tests did not improve clinical decision-making about empirical treatment of suspected ascitic fluid infection. Although statistically significant differences in ascitic fluid pH were detected between infected samples and control samples, these differences did not appear to be clinically helpful. The ascitic fluid pH was 0% sensitive in detecting the presence of bacteria in the absence of neutrophils (i.e., no such specimens had a pH lower than 7.35). Ascitic fluid pH correlated well with neutrophil count and appears to be, at least in part, an indirect measure of the presence of neutrophils in ascitic fluid. Measurement of pH or lactate (or arterial-ascitic fluid gradients) is not helpful in the clinical management of infected ascitic fluid. \nKlinefelter's syndrome and liver adenoma. We describe the occurrence of a liver adenoma in a young patient with Klinefelter's syndrome, diagnosed by classic 47,XXY karyotype in all investigated cells and a sex hormone imbalance. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an association, which might suggest a simple coincidence. However, a pathogenetic link between Klinefelter's syndrome and liver adenoma can be suggested in view of the following facts: Liver adenoma mostly affects women of child-bearing age using oral contraceptives. It is very rare in men, and affected men frequently have been treated with androgens. Both groups are characterized by a sex hormone imbalance. Also, the risk of breast cancer, another hormone-sensitive tumor, is greatly elevated in men with Klinefelter's syndrome, possibly due to sex hormone imbalance. \nHeart rate response during exercise testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring in patients with syndrome X. The response of the heart rate during exercise testing and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring performed with patients not receiving antianginal treatment was assessed in 26 patients (9 men and 17 women; mean age 51 +/- 8 years) with syndrome X (angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries), in 27 patients with coronary artery disease (10 men and 17 women; mean age 55 +/- 9 years), and in 21 healthy subjects (8 men and 13 women; mean age 47 +/- 11 years). In patients with syndrome X the slope of the regression line of heart rate versus time (heart rate/time slope) during exercise testing was similar to that of patients with coronary artery disease (3.3 +/- 0.8 versus 3.1 +/- 1.2 beats/min), but significantly lower than that in healthy subjects (4.2 +/- 1.1 beats/min; p less than 0.003). In patients with syndrome X the intercept of the heart rate/time slope was significantly higher than that in coronary artery disease patients and healthy subjects (102 +/- 15, 86 +/- 18, and 90 +/- 16 beats/min, respectively; p less than 0.015). Resting preexercise heart rate was also significantly higher in syndrome X, compared with coronary artery disease patients and healthy subjects (91 +/- 16, 79 +/- 16, and 80 +/- 14 beats/min, respectively). During ambulatory ECG monitoring, mean diurnal heart rate (from 6 AM to 6 PM) was higher in patients with syndrome X (83 +/- 8 beats/min) than in patients with coronary artery disease (75 +/- 8 beats/min) and healthy subjects (74 +/- 11 beats/min) (p less than 0.02). \nAssociation of immunoreactive eosinophil major basic protein with placental septa and cysts. A protein that is immunochemically indistinguishable from the major basic protein of the eosinophil granule is present at elevated concentrations in the plasma of pregnant women. Major basic protein has been localized to placental trophoblasts known as X cells. Because X cells are located in placental septa and septal cysts, we tested whether the numbers of these structures are correlated with plasma levels of major basic protein. Data analysis revealed strong positive correlations between maternal plasma major basic protein concentrations and the number of placental septa, septal cysts, and subchorial cysts and the presence of subchorial fibrin deposits. No significant correlation was found between plasma major basic protein levels and other variables examined, such as placental weight. Thus major basic protein is a specific marker for septa and cysts, presumably because it is an X-cell product. The study of major basic protein may aid in delineating the function and ontogeny of X cells, as well as their role in fibrin deposition and in septa and cyst formation. \nExperimental model of left ventricular failure. A model of chronic cardiac failure has undergone extensive hemodynamic investigation. Under anesthesia the homonymous and second diagonal coronary arteries of sheep have been ligated. The resulting myocardial infarction caused significant acute hemodynamic impairment (paired two-tailed t tests), mean pulmonary artery pressure increasing from 7.31 +/- 0.94 to 13.80 +/- 1.19 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure increasing from 4.94 +/- 1.03 to 11.13 +/- 1.27 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and directly measured left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increasing from 9.31 +/- 1.52 to 17.42 +/- 1.82 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) after infarction documented with invasive monitoring. There was a hemodynamically significant left ventricular aneurysm (paired two-tailed t tests) in animals studied 3 months later, with increased mean pulmonary artery pressure from 7.20 +/- 1.15 to 13.80 +/- 2.00 mm Hg (p = 0.009), an increase in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure from 4.60 +/- 1.30 to 12.10 +/- 2.06 mm Hg (p = 0.006), and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 11.00 +/- 1.94 mm Hg before infarction to 17.00 +/- 2.69 mm Hg (p = 0.038). We conclude that this is a useful model of chronic left ventricular failure that is reproducible and applicable to investigations of therapeutic options in chronic heart failure. \nThe clinical and endocrine outcome to trans-sphenoidal microsurgery of nonsecreting pituitary adenomas. From 1962 to 1987, 126 patients underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery for primary treatment of pituitary adenomas unassociated with clinical or biochemical evidence of hormonal overproduction. There were 73 male and 53 female patients (mean age, 50 +/- 12 years). Before surgery, 56% of the patients (70 of 124) had headaches, 74% (94 of 126) had deterioration of vision, and 12% (15 of 126) had ophthalmoplegia. Endocrine evaluation revealed the presence of hypogonadism in 75% (87 of 115), adrenal insufficiency in 36% (46 of 126), and hypothyroidism in 18% (21 of 122). Plasma prolactin was increased in 65% (56 of 86) with a mean level of 39 +/- 14 micrograms/l (normal, 3 to 20 micrograms/l). Radiologic enlargement of the sella turcica was documented in all cases: 67% (84 of 126) had enclosed and 33% (42 of 126) had invasive adenomas. After surgery, vision was normalized or improved in 75% (71 of 94) of the patients. Thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal functions were improved in 14% (three of 22), 41% (19 of 46), 11% (ten of 87), were unchanged in 82% (100 of 122), 77% (97 of 126), 89% (102 of 115), and worsened in 15% (19 of 22), 8% (ten of 126), 3% (102 of 115), respectively. Permanent diabetes insipidus occurred in 5% (seven of 126). Two patients died during the immediate postoperative period. The recurrence rate in patients with a mean follow-up of 6.4 +/- 4.2 years was 21% (15 of 71). These data indicate that trans-sphenoidal microsurgery is an effective and safe initial treatment for patients with nonsecreting pituitary adenoma and may reverse hypopituitarism. \nThe current approach to the medical diagnosis of low back pain. A small number of patients who present with low back pain will have an underlying medical disorder as the source of their pain. Patients who fail to respond to conservative management with controlled physical activity and nonnarcotic analgesics should have a thorough re-evaluation to detect possible sources of nonmechanical pain. Symptoms of fever, weight loss, recumbency pain, morning stiffness, acute severe pain, or colicky back pain represent specific entry points into the algorithm for diagnosis of back pain from underlying systemic illnesses. These patients will generally require a plain roentgenographic examination with subsequent scintography, MRI, CT, laboratory work, and biopsy as indicated by any positive findings during the diagnostic work-up. Therapy for individuals with nonmechanical low back pain is directed at the specific medical disorder that is the cause of their symptoms. \nMelanocytic differentiation of human neuroblastoma: expression of a human melanosome-associated antigen. Five human neuroblastoma cell lines were examined for expression of a human melanosome-associated antigen (HMSA). Only cell line SK-N-SH reacted with a monoclonal antibody, HMSA-2, shown to recognize melanosomal glycoproteins. To further characterize the melanocytic lineages of SK-N-SH, three morphologically distinct clones designated SK-N-SH-N (neuroblast type), SK-N-SH-F (fibroblast type), and SK-N-SH-EP (epithelial type) were established by colony formation cloning. By fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and tyrosinase assay, we found that only SK-N-SH-EP and SK-N-SH-F reacted with HMSA-2 and had tyrosinase activity. These results suggest that epithelial-type and fibroblast-type cells appear to possess the melanocytic potential, but not neuroblast-type cells. Furthermore, SK-N-SH-EP was found to spontaneously convert to neuroblast-type or fibroblast-type cells, whereas SK-N-SH-N and SK-N-SH-F clones have remained morphologically stable. Our results suggest that at least one neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH, may be an excellent model for investigating clonal maturation and the melanocytic differentiation of neuroblastoma. \nLevels of morphine and metabolites in CSF during respiratory depression after intraventricular morphine injection. We report a case of respiratory depression after intracerebroventricular morphine administration of a dose inadvertently 10 times greater than the typical daily dose. At the time of the respiratory dysfunction, the concentrations of morphine and its metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were determined. On comparison of these results with previous clinical studies in which there was no respiratory depression, no relationship was found between the occurrence of respiratory depression and the concentration of morphine or its metabolites in the CSF. The occurrence and characteristics of respiratory depression may be related to the concentrations of morphine and its metabolites in bulbar tissue. \nInfluence of progressive and of transient hypoxia on upper airway resistance in normal humans. In order to evaluate the influence of hypoxia on upper airway patency, we measured the response of upper airway resistance (UAR) to progressive (P) normocapnic hypoxia (Rebuck's method) and transient (T) hypoxia (three to five breaths to 100% N2) in 11 normal men. Breath-by-breath inspiratory UAR was calculated at isoflow during exclusive nasal breathing. The UAR response to hypoxia was characterized by the changes in nasal resistance and pharyngeal resistance (PR) as a function of SaO2, mean inspiratory flow (VT/Tl), and changes in the end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) measured with an inductance vest. The ventilatory response to hypoxia was greater during T (-0.31 +/- 0.03 L/min/%SaO2; mean +/- SEM) than during P (-0.27 +/- 0.03 L/min/%SaO2, p = 0.05). UAR decreased as SaO2 decreased; this decrease was steeper during T than during P hypoxia (delta PR/%SaO2: 3.9 +/- 0.5 during P and 2.5 +/- 0.2 during T, p = 0.05). For the whole group, there was no difference in the slope of the decrease in UAR with increasing VT/Tl between the two hypoxic tests (delta PR/delta VT/Tl: -0.85 +/- 0.1 during P and -0.70 +/- 0.1 during T, p greater than 0.05). However, in four subjects, the slope of the relationship PR/VT/Tl during T remained steeper than during P. EELV increased as SaO2 decreased, with a greater increase during progressive than during transient hypoxia. \nHigh frequency of the Gaucher disease mutation at nucleotide 1226 among Ashkenazi Jews. Reliable estimates of the frequency of Gaucher disease-producing mutations are not available. The high frequency of Gaucher disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is due to the occurrence of a mutation at nucleotide (nt) 1226. We have screened 593 DNA samples from normal Ashkenazi Jews, as well as 62 DNA samples from all our Ashkenazi Jewish patients with Gaucher disease, for the presence of the 1226 mutation. In the 593 presumed normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals the 1226 mutation was identified in the heterozygous state in 37 and in the homozygous state in two, giving a gene frequency of .035 for the mutation. This 1226 mutation represented 73% of the 124 Gaucher disease alleles in Jewish Gaucher disease patients. Accordingly we estimate that the gene frequency for Gaucher disease among the Ashkenazi Jewish population is .047, which is equivalent to a carrier frequency of 8.9% and a birth incidence of 1:450. \nAortic-carotid artery pressure differences and cephalic perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in humans. OBJECTIVE: Animal studies have shown an aortic-carotid artery pressure difference during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which compromises cerebral perfusion. This pressure difference is most marked with prolonged CPR and can be abolished with administration of high doses of epinephrine. To better understand the mechanism of cerebral blood flow during CPR in humans, we determined the aortic-carotid artery pressure difference, the cephalic perfusion pressure (the carotid artery-jugular vein pressure difference), and thoracic inlet venous \"valving\" (the central venous-jugular vein pressure difference), while administering standard doses of epinephrine. DESIGN: Prospective study with randomization as to which side the carotid artery was catheterized. SETTING: The resuscitation room of a large urban hospital's emergency department. PATIENTS: Fifteen adults in normothermic, nontraumatic prehospital cardiac arrest treated according to Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines, including administration of 1 mg epinephrine iv every 5 mins. INTERVENTIONS: The descending aorta, cervical common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and central venous system were catheterized. Pressures were recorded during standard CPR for 5 mins after administration of 1 mg epinephrine iv. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Most patients received CPR for greater than 20 mins before the first epinephrine dose and for greater than 45 mins before pressure recording as described above. There was no significant difference between aortic and carotid artery compression and relaxation phase pressures. The mean +/- SD compression central venous-jugular vein pressure difference was 22.1 +/- 15.0 mm Hg, and the mean cephalic perfusion pressure was 20.8 +/- 19.5 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: There is no clinically important aortic-carotid artery pressure difference during human CPR using the standard dose of epinephrine, even with prolonged CPR. Despite carotid artery patency and thoracic inlet venous valving, the cephalic perfusion pressure is low during CPR in humans. \nDutch general practice care for patients with epilepsy: results from the Dutch National Survey of Morbidity and Interventions. This study aimed to assess the share which Dutch general practice has in the care of patients with epilepsy. During a 3-month period 400,000 patient contacts in 103 general practices with a total list of 335,000 patients were registered, 1536 of these, concerning 1059 patients, concerned epilepsy. Contacts with patients with known epilepsy in Dutch General Practice were handled mainly by the practice nurse and most involved repeat prescriptions. Patients suspected of having epilepsy had more attention from the General Practitioner. The involvement of General Practitioners in the care of epilepsy was found to be small, but not unimportant. GPs are in a crucial position as regards the detection of epilepsy. They can enlarge their role in respect of patients with known epilepsy and improve continuity of care. \nHemodynamic study during transdermal application of nitroglycerin tape in patients with cirrhosis. We studied 14 patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis using portal and hepatic vein catheterizations to determine the effects of transdermal application of nitroglycerin tape (containing 10 mg of nitroglycerin and capable of releasing 6 to 7 mg of nitroglycerin in 12 hr) on splanchnic hemodynamics. Patients randomly received nitroglycerin (n = 7) or a placebo (n = 7). No significant changes were observed after the administration of the placebo. In contrast, transdermal nitroglycerin caused a significant reduction in portal pressure, as evaluated by measurements of the portal venous pressure gradient (-22%, p less than 0.01). The reduction of portal pressure was due to a decrease in the portal venous pressure, with no changes in the free hepatic venous pressure. Despite the fall in portal pressure, the hepatic blood flow was maintained. These findings suggest that transdermal nitroglycerin could be potentially useful in the treatment of portal hypertension associated with cirrhosis. \nAuer rod-like inclusions in circulating lymphoma cells. Circulating malignant lymphocytes from a 55-year-old woman with small cleaved follicular center cell lymphoma contained azurophilic splinter-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions. By light microscopic and ultrastructural criteria, these structures closely resembled Auer rods found in acute myeloid leukemia; however, the authors could not find cytochemical evidence of lysosomal origin (results were negative for myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, acid phosphatase, and periodic acid-Schiff). Immunostaining and flow cytometric analysis confirmed a monoclonal IgM-kappa immunophenotype of the circulating malignant lymphoid cells. The inclusions did not show specific immunoglobulin staining by light microscopic or electron microscopic immunostaining techniques. The authors conclude that these membrane-bound inclusions probably represent aberrant lysosomes in the malignant cells. \nCell cycle regulation of histone H1 kinase activity associated with the adenoviral protein E1A. Several cellular proteins form stable complexes with the proteins encoded by the adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) gene in extracts derived from adenovirus infected or transformed cells. Two of the cellular proteins that bind to E1A have been identified; one, a 105-kilodalton protein (pRb), is the product of the retinoblastoma gene, and the other, a 60-kilodalton protein, is a human cyclin A. Two other proteins that bind E1A have now been shown to be related to p34cdc2. This E1A complex displayed histone H1-specific kinase activity; the kinase activity was modulated during the cell division cycle, and association of pRb with E1A apparently was not required for this activity. \nComparison of standard external CPR, open-chest CPR, and cardiopulmonary bypass in a canine myocardial infarct model. STUDY OBJECTIVES: After cardiac arrest, open-chest CPR (OCCPR) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have demonstrated higher resuscitation rates when compared individually with standard external CPR (SECPR). We compared all three techniques in a canine myocardial infarct ventricular fibrillation model. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six mongrel dogs were block-randomized to receive SECPR and advanced life support (nine), CPB (nine), or OCCPR (eight). DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: All dogs received left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by four minutes of ventricular fibrillation without CPR and eight minutes of Thumper CPR. At 12 minutes, dogs received one of three resuscitation techniques. After resuscitation, all animals received four hours of intensive care. Animals that were resuscitated had histochemical determination of ischemic and necrotic myocardial areas. MEASUREMENTS: Intravascular pressures were measured and coronary perfusion pressure was calculated during baseline, cardiac arrest, resuscitation, and postresuscitation periods. Percent necrotic myocardium, percent ischemic myocardium, and necrotic-to-ischemic ratios were determined for resuscitated animals. Epinephrine dosage and number of countershocks were determined for each group. MAIN RESULTS: Nine of nine CPB and six of nine OCCPR, compared with two of eight SECPR animals, were resuscitated (P less than .01). Three of nine CPB and OCCPR and two of eight SECPR dogs survived to four hours (P = NS). Coronary perfusion pressure two minutes after institution of technique was significantly higher with CPB (75 +/- 37 mm Hg) and OCCPR (56 +/- 31 mm Hg) than in SECPR animals (16 +/- 16 mm Hg, P less than .04). Epinephrine required for resuscitation was significantly less with CPB (0.10 +/- 0.02 mg/kg) than for SECPR (0.28 +/- 0.11 mg/kg, P less than .002). The ratio of necrotic to ischemic myocardium at four hours was significantly lower with CPB (0.15 +/- 0.31) and OCCPR (0.39 +/- 0.25) than for SECPR (1.16 +/- 0.31, P less than .02). CONCLUSION: OCCPR and CPB produce higher coronary perfusion pressures and improved resuscitation rates from ventricular fibrillation when compared with SECPR in this canine myocardial infarct cardiac arrest model. CPB and OCCPR yielded similar resuscitation results, although less epinephrine was required with CPB. \nUltrasound detection of fetal aneuploidy in patients with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein. Increasing confidence in the ability of high-resolution ultrasound to detect neural tube and ventral wall defects has enabled us to offer a revised risk estimate to the patient with an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level, such that amniocentesis may not be necessary. Recent authors have suggested that a reduced emphasis on follow-up amniocentesis fails to consider an increased risk for chromosomal anomalies in pregnancies with an elevated MSAFP, and that amniocentesis should still be performed. We reviewed our ultrasound findings from patients who underwent amniocentesis for evaluation of an elevated MSAFP and who had a karyotype prepared from the amniotic fluid sample. Four abnormal karyotypes were detected among 313 amniocenteses, and three of these were correctly predicted based on an abnormal ultrasound. The risk of an unexpected fetal aneuploidy after a normal consultative ultrasound in our series was one in 310. This is comparable to the risk of detecting abnormal chromosomes in the fetus of a 32-year-old woman, an age at which amniocentesis is not routinely offered. \nHepatocellular carcinoma in Italian patients with cirrhosis BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are recognized as being at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. The magnitude of the risk, the natural history of this disease, and the possibilities for detecting potentially curable tumors in patients in the Western world are unknown. To address these questions, we examined 447 Italian patients with well-compensated cirrhosis (which was of viral origin in 62 percent of them) from 1985 through 1990, performing serum alpha-fetoprotein assays and real-time ultrasonography every 3 to 12 months. RESULTS. Hepatocellular carcinoma was found in 30 patients (7 percent) at base line and in another 29 patients (7 percent of 417 patients free of tumor at base line) during follow-up periods averaging 33 months (range, 1 to 48). The cumulative hazard of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma during follow-up was higher among patients with persistently elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels (12 with tumors among 42 with such levels) than among those with fluctuating levels (11 among 82) or those with consistently normal levels (6 among 255). Only 17 patients had potentially operable tumors. The proportion of potentially operable tumors among those detected during follow-up was significantly lower than the proportion at enrollment (4 of 29 vs. 13 of 30, P = 0.027). The survival at one year of the 12 patients who underwent surgery was 67 percent, and the tumor-recurrence rate was 60 percent. Outcome was not appreciably different for the five patients who refused surgery. CONCLUSIONS. In the West, as in Asia, patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at substantial risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, with a yearly incidence rate of 3 percent. Our screening program did not appreciably increase the rate of detection of potentially curable tumors. \nIsolated muscle hypertrophy as a sign of radicular or peripheral nerve injury. Two patients with isolated neurogenic hypertrophy of the trapezius muscle due to accessory nerve injury and a patient with neurogenic hypertrophy of the anterior tibial muscle due to chronic radicular lesion L4 are described. Electromyography of the affected muscles showed dense continuing spontaneous discharges of complex potentials. Muscle biopsy performed in two patients showed abundant hypertrophic muscle fibres, identified in one case by ATP-ase reaction as being of predominantly type I. In the majority of previously reported patients with neurogenic muscle hypertrophy confined to the calf muscle, a passive stretch mechanism was suggested as a cause of the hypertrophy. It is assumed that the excessive spontaneous muscle activity gave rise to the hypertrophy in these patients. This may also be true in previously reported patients with neurogenic hypertrophy and similar spontaneous activity in electromyography. \nManagement of panfacial fractures. Panfacial injuries are those that involve trauma to the lower, middle, and upper facial bones. They often are accompanied by multisystem- or polytrauma and require a team approach for management. Although stabilization of the overall status of the patient takes precedence, early and total restoration of facial form and function should be the goal of the maxillofacial surgeon. \nRalitoline: a reevaluation of anticonvulsant profile and determination of \"active\" plasma concentrations in comparison with prototype antiepileptic drugs in mice. Ralitoline (RLT) is a new thiazolidinone derivative with potent anticonvulsant activity in different seizure models. During Phase I studies, RLT was well tolerated in human volunteers and showed linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range tested (up to 150 mg). Since RLT will soon be entering clinical Phase II studies, we were interested in obtaining predictive data for effective plasma concentrations in patients. For this purpose, the anticonvulsant potency of RLT was determined in four seizure models in mice, and plasma levels were measured at time of peak drug effect. The four models were the threshold for maximal (tonic extension) electroshock seizures (MES), the threshold for clonic seizures determined by i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), the traditional MES test with supramaximal (50 mA) stimulation, and generalized clonic seizures induced by s.c. administration of PTZ. Furthermore, median minimal \"neurotoxic\" doses (TD50s) were determined by the rotorod and chimney test for calculation of protective indices. All data obtained for RLT were compared with data obtained with standard antiepileptic drugs: phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproate, and diazepam. The onset of anticonvulsant action after i.p. injection of RLT was very rapid, and the peak drug effect was already obtained after 2 min. In the MES models, RLT was the most potent compound. \"Active\" plasma levels ranged from approximately 300 ng/ml in the MES threshold test to approximately 1,300 ng/ml in the MES test. RLT was also capable of increasing the PTZ threshold, whereas, possibly because of its short duration of action in mice, it was not very active in the s.c. PTZ seizure test. \nThe prognostic value of endotracheal tube-air leak following tracheal surgery in children. In an effort to determine if the endotracheal tube-leak pressure has prognostic value in relation to a successful outcome after one-stage laryngotracheal reconstruction or cricoid split surgery, a retrospective analysis was performed on 17 children who had undergone such surgery. The daily leak pressures, length of intubation, and ultimate outcome of attempts at extubation were noted. One hundred percent of patients with a leak pressure of less than 20 cm H2O on the day before extubation were successfully extubated. In contrast, the failure rate was 100% in children extubated with a leak of greater than 30 mm H2O. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (chi 2, 13.03). Sixty percent of patients with leak pressures in the range of 21 to 30 cm H2O were successfully extubated. The endotracheal tube-leak pressure is a parameter that has prognostic value, and should be considered in determining when to extubate children who have undergone tracheal reconstructive surgery. \nInteraction of baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflex control of sympathetic nerve activity in normal humans. Animal studies have demonstrated that activation of the baroreflex by increases in arterial pressure inhibits cardiovascular and ventilatory responses to activation of peripheral chemoreceptors (PC) with hypoxia. In this study, we examined the influences of baroreflex activation on the sympathetic response to stimulation of PC and central chemoreceptors in humans. PC were stimulated by hypoxia (10% O2/90% N2) (n = 6) and central chemoreceptors by hypercapnia (7% CO2/93% O2) (n = 6). Responses to a cold pressor stimulus were also obtained as an internal reflex control to determine the selectivity of the interactive influence of baroreflex activation. Baroreflex activation was achieved by raising mean blood pressure by greater than 10 mmHg with intravenous infusion of phenylephrine (PE). Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) to muscle was recorded from a peroneal nerve (microneurography). During hypoxia alone, SNA increased from 255 +/- 92 to 354 +/- 107 U/min (P less than 0.05). During PE alone, mean blood pressure increased and SNA decreased to 87 +/- 45 U/min (P less than 0.05). With hypoxia during baroreflex activation with PE, SNA did not increase (50 +/- 23 U/min). During hypercapnia alone, SNA increased from 116 +/- 39 to 234 +/- 72 U/min (P less than 0.01). Hypercapnia during baroreflex activation with PE increased SNA from 32 +/- 25 U/min during PE alone to 61 +/- 26 U/min during hypercapnia and PE (P less than 0.05). Like hypercapnia (but unlike hypoxia) the cold pressor test also increased SNA during PE. We conclude that baroreflex activation selectively abolishes the SNA response to hypoxia but not to hypercapnia or the cold pressor test. The inhibitory interaction of the baroreflex and the peripheral chemoreflex may be explained by convergence of baroreceptor and peripheral chemoreceptor afferents on neurons in the medulla. \nOsteochondrodysplasia in Fryns syndrome. Various skeletal abnormalities have been identified in roentgenograms of persons with Fryns syndrome, but to our knowledge, no histopathologic description of bone or cartilage has been published. We describe disordered endochondral and intramembranous bone formation in a premature female infant with Fryns syndrome. This infant and a full sibling (ie, had same set of parents) with Fryns syndrome in addition exhibited delayed ossification of the basiocciput and of cervical vertebral bodies, also previously undescribed in Fryns syndrome. These findings expand the spectrum of Fryns syndrome to include osteochondrodysplasia. \nPylorus and antroseromuscular flap-preserving gastrectomy--a new type of reconstruction after subtotal gastrectomy for treatment of gastroduodenal ulcer: clinical and experimental study. To avoid motility disturbances after Billroth gastrectomy, the authors designed pylorus and antroseromuscular flap-preserving subtotal gastrectomy (PAFPG). Results showed that gastric motility and emptying time of dogs after PAFPG were close to normal. PAFPG was applied to 125 consecutive patients with gastroduodenal ulcers (gastric ulcer, 15 patients; duodenal ulcer, 94 patients; and combined ulcers, 16 patients) confirmed by barium examination and fibro-gastroendoscopy. All patients recovered smoothly, none of them had postoperative complication. Gastric acid output reduction rates were as follows: basal acid output, 85.05% +/- 8.13%; maximal acid output, 81.76% +/- 10.85%; peak acid output, 81.42% +/- 10.15%. The incidence of postoperative enterogastric reflux (endoscopically) and the concentration of cholic acids in gastric juice were significantly lower in patients after PAFPG than after Billroth I or II gastrectomy. Results suggest that PAFPG reduced gastric acid outputs definitely and overcame adverse motility consequences after Billroth I or II gastrectomy desirably. \nAstrocytoma and associated arteriovenous malformation. A case is reported of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation occurring in continuity with an astrocytoma. Possible etiologies of this unusual association are discussed. \nClinical management of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy. Rapid delivery of thrombolytic therapy to suitable patients with acute myocardial infarction can limit myocardial damage and reduce the risk of death. This requires an emergency department team approach following a written protocol to initiate thrombolytic therapy within 45 minutes of the patient's arrival at the emergency department. Nurses and physicians caring for patients with acute myocardial infarction must be aware of inclusion and exclusion criteria, drug preparation, dosage and administration, recommended adjunctive therapies, and potential complications associated with pharmacologic thrombolysis. All patients with acute myocardial infarction should be carefully screened for their potential for receiving thrombolytic therapy with a favorable benefit/risk ratio. \nManagement of patients with facial trauma and associated ocular/orbital injuries. Ocular injury can be associated with facial fractures in a significant percentage of cases. It is mandatory for surgeons treating such fractures to be familiar with the types of orbital injuries, the appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests, and the management techniques involved in treating traumatic visual loss. This article reviews the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this important problem. \nSustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias following coronary artery bypass surgery comparing mammary versus saphenous vein grafts. This retrospective study was designed to determine the incidence of sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTs) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts, Group A, compared with those with saphenous vein grafts (SVG), Group B. Among 569 consecutive patients who underwent CABG surgery in the same institution, a total of 80 cases from Group A and 80 cases from Group B were selected for this study after application of exclusion criteria. Excluded from this study were the following: patients with preexisting or prior history of SVTs, significant left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 40%), postoperative myocardial infarction, drug toxicity or electrolyte imbalance, and advanced chronic obstructive lung disease. Group A consisted of 63 men and 17 women and Group B consisted of 52 men and 28 women. All patients were monitored either in ICU or by telemetry for a period of three to six days after surgery and all had a predischarge 12-lead electrocardiogram. Both groups were fairly comparable in most of their clinical profile and number of grafts. The incidence of SVTs in Group A was 31% (25 of 80 patients) and in Group B was 24% (19 of 80 patients). Furthermore, the incidence of postoperative pericarditis was noted in 35% (28 of 80 patients) of Group A and in 19% (15 of 80 patients) in Group B. The authors conclude that male tobacco smokers of Group A tended to have a significantly higher incidence of postoperative pericarditis with a higher trend for postoperative SVTs than patients from Group B. \nStress and alcohol interaction: an update of human research. The literature on alcohol and stress in human subjects carried out since 1981 is reviewed. The review covers selected aspects of the interaction of alcohol and stress. (1) Most of the review focuses on the role of stress on alcohol ingestion. Retrospective research based on data from the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicated an increase in alcohol consumption with anxiety in certain groups of, as yet not well characterized, individuals. For example, although still insufficiently documented, stress does not appear to play a significant role in alcohol ingestion by women and the elderly. By contrast, stress does appear to play a role in the control of alcohol ingestion by adolescents. Prospective studies employing questionnaire-interview formats generally support an effect of stress on alcohol ingestion. However, studies employing male college aged social drinkers did not find a correlation between levels of stress and ingestion of alcohol. Alcoholics also differ in the reasons for drinking alcohol, but generally ingest alcohol to lessen anxiety/stress. It is clear that the Tension Reduction Hypothesis as originally postulated is no longer adequate. Many new models based on an interaction of alcohol and stress have been proposed to explain the control of alcohol consumption. Considering the multidimensionality of factors that appear to contribute to the control of alcohol ingestion, it is unlikely that a single model could possibly be relevant to alcohol ingestion under all conditions. More likely different models may be relevant to alcohol consumption under specific conditions, or for specific populations. (2) Alcohol has been reported to decrease anxiety in agoraphobics. The self-medication by agoraphobics may contribute significantly to their alcohol abuse. (3) Alcohol has also been reported to decrease tremor of the hands in stressed subjects as well as in patients with essential tremor. (4) Although a number of studies have employed electrodermal activity in studies aimed at the interaction of alcohol and stress, the results have been rather inconsistent. (5) The controversy on the purported beneficial effect of alcohol on the cardiovascular system persists. A number of studies have shown a J- or U-shaped relationship between alcohol ingestion and incidence of coronary heart disease. Alcohol may also influence stress-induced changes in blood pressure. Although a number of studies have demonstrated lower blood pressure in individuals ingesting less than two drinks per day compared with abstainers or heavy alcohol imbibers, the evidence is not conclusive. (6) It is not clear whether the interaction of alcohol and stress involves alterations in plasma catecholamines. \nThe role of plasminogen activator in adhesion prevention. The reduction in peritoneal plasminogen activator activity (believed to be the pathogenic mechanism of adhesion formation) and its replacement with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) have been investigated in the prevention of initial (primary) and recurrent adhesion production. Other, potentially harmful, effects of intra-abdominal rt-PA application have also been examined. This included effects on wound and colonic healing and hemostasis. The prevention of adhesion formation was studied in primary and recurrent adhesion formation using a rabbit model. Primary adhesions formed in one of 14 occasions (7 per cent) with rt-PA compared with 12 of 15 occasions (80 per cent) with placebo (chi-square equals 15.542, p less than 0.001). Recurrent adhesions formed on two of 27 occasions (7 per cent) with rt-PA compared with 22 of 28 occasions with placebo (79 per cent) and 12 of 12 occasions with control rabbits (100 per cent, chi-square equals 40.588, p less than 0.0001). The application of rt-PA to abdominal wounds in the rabbit failed to show any reduction in wound strength at four, seven and ten days. Colonic anastomotic healing was unaltered by rt-PA at three, five and seven days. There was no difference seen in hemorrhagic events between control, placebo or rt-PA rabbits at any stage. The use of rt-PA is an exciting development in the field of adhesion prevention; it is an effective inhibitor of adhesion formation and intra-abdominal administration appears safe in a rabbit model. \nSynchronous primary mucosal melanoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. We present a case of contiguous primary malignant melanoma of the nose and maxillary antrum and mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. We believe that this association has not been previously recorded; whether this represents divergent differentiation in a single tumour or 'collision' of two separate tumours is uncertain. \nVariation in intravaginal pressure measurements. The wide variation in intravaginal pressure measurements of the circumvaginal muscles (CVM) was studied in five subjects under well-controlled conditions. Previous research and clinical observations have indicated that fluctuations in the measurement of intravaginal pressure may be associated with time of day, day of testing, and existing stress factors. Subjects were assessed four times per day, on four consecutive days, for a total of 16 assessments. At each of the 16 conditions for a given subject, 10 CVM contractions lasting 12 seconds each were recorded and the variables, maximum pressure (MP10), peak maximum pressure (PMP), and abdominal pressure were analyzed. The within-subject variance was 15.5 (SD = 3.9); the between-subject variance was 132.4 (SD = 11.5). The effects of day, time, and stressor were analyzed by ANOVA specifically designed for variance estimates; no significant differences were found. The clinical observations that led to the study were not supported when systematically investigated. However, consistent data collection procedures appeared to reduce within-subject variance. \nExtracranial vertebral artery dissection following tonic clonic seizure. A 34 year old woman developed cerebral infarction, following a tonic-clonic seizure. A vertebral artery dissection was demonstrated and may have been caused by arterial trauma during the seizure. This cause of morbidity following convulsive seizures may have been overlooked in the past and needs to be recognised in view of the potential benefits of anticoagulation. \nA prospective study of parental history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease in men. The relation between parental history of myocardial infarction (MI) and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) was prospectively examined among 45,317 U.S. male health professionals who were free of diagnosed CAD, 40 to 75 years of age in 1986 and followed for 2 years. These men provided details of parental history of MI, including their parents' age at the first event, their personal history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus, and a detailed dietary assessment completed at baseline. During 72,454 person-years of follow-up, 181 non-fatal MIs were documented, 49 men died from MI or sudden death, and 140 underwent coronary artery surgery or angioplasty. Compared with men without any history of parental MI, those whose mothers or fathers had had an MI at less than 70 years of age had a substantially elevated risk of MI (relative risk = 2.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.8 for maternal history; relative risk = 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.3 for paternal history). Risk of MI increased with decreasing age at parental MI. Paternal but not maternal history of MI was related to increased risk of coronary artery surgery. These associations were not appreciably altered by controlling for diet or established risk factors, either individually or in multivariate models. These prospective data indicate that a history of MI in either parent is associated with an increased risk of CAD among men. \nComparison of the effects of torasemide and furosemide in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites: a randomized, double-blind study. In a randomized double-blind trial we compared the effects of torasemide, a new loop diuretic, and furosemide in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites during a 3-day period in association with potassium canrenoate (200 mg/day) administration. Doses of loop diuretics administered in this trial (10 and 25 mg/day of torasemide and furosemide, respectively) had been shown to be equipotent in healthy subjects. Torasemide induced significantly greater natriuresis than furosemide (p less than 0.02), with a twofold greater percentage increase in basal values (day 1: 130% vs. 50%; day 2: 104% vs. 42%; and day 3: 65% vs. 26%, respectively). Body weight loss was significantly higher during torasemide (p less than 0.02) administration, and the overall decrease at the end of the treatment was twice as high for furosemide (2.5 +/- 0.6 kg vs. 1.3 +/- 0.4 kg, respectively). Diuresis was also higher during torasemide administration, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08). The extent of kaliuresis observed during the two treatments was almost identical despite the striking differences in the natriuretic response. The effects of the two treatments on plasma electrolytes, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma arginine vasopressin concentration were similar. Both drugs caused increases in plasma renin activity at the end of the treatment, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration slightly increased only after torasemide administration. Despite the presence of a trend toward a more pronounced effect on these parameters after torasemide administration, no significant difference between the two treatments was observed. \nNeurophysiological observations on the effects of botulinum toxin treatment in patients with dystonic blepharospasm. Botulinum toxin treatment improves dystonic blepharospasm by inducing transient paresis of the orbicularis oculi muscle. It is not known if it also reduces the enhanced brainstem neuronal excitability found in this disorder. We have performed conventional electromyography (EMG) and blink reflex excitability studies on fifteen patients with blepharospasm before and after botulinum toxin treatment. Denervation signs were found with needle EMG in all treated muscles. Amplitude of the facial compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and R1 response was reduced after botulinum toxin injections. In blink reflex excitability studies, the recovery of R2 response was enhanced after treatment even when patients were tested at the time of maximal benefit from botulinum toxin injections. The results suggest that there is little influence of botulinum toxin treatment upon the enhanced excitability of brainstem interneurons in patients with blepharospasm. \nClinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of testis. Observation vs retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Between 1980 and 1989, 186 patients with testicular tumors were seen at Roswell Park Memorial Institute. Of these, 66.6 percent (124/186) were diagnosed to have nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGT) and 22 percent (41/186) were clinically determined to have Stage I disease. Patients with clinical Stage I NSGT either underwent observation or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Recurrence in the observation group of patients was 23.5 percent (4/17) between four and eighteen months (mean 10 months) with the retroperitoneum being the most common site. All but 1 patient (80%) were salvaged with platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Of the 24 patients who had RPLND, 21 percent (5/24) had a false-negative metastatic evaluation. All the patients who had surgically documented metastatic disease were successfully treated with chemotherapy. The similar recurrence rates in the observation group and the false-negative RPLND group suggest that the failure rate in the observation group is a result of the inability to stage accurately patients with NSGT. RPLND continues to be the standard therapy in patients with clinical Stage I disease. Despite its high recurrence rate, observation should, however, be offered to well-motivated and selected patients since salvage platinum-based combination chemotherapy is very effective and the majority of patients in this group are spared a major operative procedure. \nCure of early-stage Hodgkin's disease with subtotal nodal irradiation. Ninety-four consecutive patients with Stage I or II Hodgkin's disease who presented supradiaphragmatically were treated with radiation therapy alone at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology from January 1978 through December 1986. Fifty-two patients (55%) were staged pathologically, and 42 (45%) were staged clinically. The latter included lymphangiography and/or abdominal computed tomographic scan. Most patients with B symptoms and/or bulky disease were excluded from this series. Seventy-four patients were treated with subtotal nodal irradiation (mantle and periaortic fields). The spleen was treated if the patient had not undergone splenectomy. Twenty patients received mantle irradiation only. No patient received total nodal irradiation. All patients had an initial complete response. With a minimum follow-up of 7 months (median, 7.7 years; seven patients died before 3 years of follow-up, but all other patients had at least 3 years of follow-up), 81 patients (86%) remained disease-free. Six of 52 (12%) of the pathologically staged group had a relapse, as did seven of 42 (17%) of the clinically staged group (P = 0.68). Eight of 57 Stage I patients versus five of 37 Stage II patients had a relapse (P greater than 0.99). Analysis of disease-free survival by age, histologic findings, sex, and sites of involvement did not predict relapse. The pelvis was the most common site of failure (nine patients, 10%). However, only three patients (3%) failed in the pelvis alone. These results indicate that patients who, after adequate clinical staging with selective use of staging laparotomy, are found to have Stage I and II Hodgkin's disease may be treated with subtotal nodal irradiation with a high rate of cure. \nConcurrent nitroglycerin administration decreases thrombolytic potential of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Dynamic coronary vasoconstriction may play a role in coronary artery reocclusion after successful thrombolysis. The effect of nitroglycerin on the thrombolytic effects of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was examined in dogs with an electrically induced occlusive coronary artery thrombus. Eleven dogs were randomly given rt-PA alone and seven rt-PA with nitroglycerin. The dose of rt-PA was 0.75 mg/kg body weight given over 20 min and the dose of nitroglycerin was 125 micrograms/min for 40 min. The reperfusion rate in the dogs given rt-PA alone was 73% (8 of 11 dogs) and that in the rt-PA plus nitroglycerin group was 57% (four of seven dogs) (p = NS). The time to thrombolysis (or reperfusion) in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was 70% greater than in those receiving rt-PA alone (means +/- SD/29.8 +/- 9.9 versus 17.6 +/- 5.9 min, p less than 0.02), and the duration of reperfusion much shorter (11 +/- 17 versus 42 +/- 16 min, p less than 0.02). Peak coronary blood flow after reperfusion in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was also less than in those receiving rt-PA alone (36 +/- 52 versus 63 +/- 20 ml/min, p less than 0.02). Reocclusion occurred in all dogs given rt-PA with nitroglycerin and in six of eight given rt-PA alone (p = NS). Plasma concentrations of rt-PA were lower when nitroglycerin was given with rt-PA alone (427 +/- 279 versus 1,471 +/- 600 ng/ml, p less than 0.01). \nDestructive lesions in demyelinating disease. Three cases are presented in which clinical and radiological features suggested the diagnosis of glioma but surgical biopsy revealed a demyelinating process, with tissue destruction and cyst formation in two. One patient had clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Two had probable acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Treatment with high dose steroids is appropriate when there is clinical or investigative evidence to suggest the presence of demyelinating disease, before deciding on biopsy. \nMortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet in China, Finland, and the United States. Mortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet were compared in Tianjin province, People's Republic of China; in North Karelia Province, Finland; and in the United States as a whole. People in Tianjin received 7 percent of their energy intake from saturated fats, whereas people in the United States received 13 percent and those in North Karelia received 20. The mean blood cholesterol levels for men were 158 milligrams per deciliter (mg per dl) for Tianjin, 216 mg per dl for the United States, and 241 mg per dl for North Karelia. The smoking prevalence among men was highest in Tianjin (66 percent), followed by the United States (42 percent) and Finland (36 percent). The differences among mortality rates for the three locales were less pronounced among women than among men. Age-standardized total mortality for women was highest for Tianjin and lowest in North Karelia. The reverse was true for men. Age-standardized total mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin and highest in North Karelia. Age-standardized ischemic heart disease mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin (99 per 100,000) and highest in North Karelia (730 per 100,000). For women, the corresponding figures were 83 per 100,000 in Tianjin and 164 per 100,000 in North Karelia. Although salt intake was higher in Tianjin than in North Karelia, the blood pressure was on average lower in persons from Tianjin than in those from North Karelia. The stroke mortality rate in Tianjin, however, was much higher than in either Finland or the United States. \nIntraoperative facial nerve monitoring: prognostic aspects during acoustic tumor removal. Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring with electrical stimulation (IFNMES) has become an integral part of acoustic tumor surgery. We reviewed the records of fifty-six patients who underwent translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removal with IFNMES. There was excellent correlation between intraoperative facial nerve activity and immediate postoperative facial nerve function (24 hours after surgery and at hospital discharge). Our data would suggest that patients who exhibit less than 500 microvolts of ongoing EMG activity during surgery, and who yield at least a 500-microvolt contraction when stimulated with 0.05 milliamps at the brainstem after tumor removal, can expect an excellent immediate facial nerve result (grade I or II). \nAn animal model for colon cancer metastatic cell line with enhanced metastasizing ability. Establishment and characterization. We have developed an animal model for colon cancer metastasis and produced a metastasizing tumor after using a microinjection technique to inject SW480 cells into the cecal wall of athymic nude mice during \"minilaparotomy.\" After the metastatic foci formed in murine lung, an in vitro primary culture was performed and a new metastatic cancer cell line, which was designated as CC-ML3, was established. The studies included: 1) the comparison between SW 480 and CC-ML3 in morphology, growth kinetics, seeding and plating efficiency, and karyotype; and 2) carcino-embryonic antigen determination, origination, and metastatic ability of CC-ML3. The results showed that CC-ML3 was significantly different from SW480 in vitro and possessed a high metastatic potential in vivo. This newly developed animal model may thus be useful for studying the biology and pathogenesis of metastasis of human colonic cancer. \nDifferential effects of atrial natriuretic peptide and dopamine on urinary protein excretion in chronic glomerulonephritis. 1. To examine whether or not atrial natriuretic peptide-induced proteinuria simply results from increases in urine flow or glomerular filtration rate, we infused dopamine (1 microgram min-1 kg-1) and alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (0.025 microgram min-1 kg-1) into nine patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and nine essential hypertensive patients without renal damage, and compared the effects of the two agents on renal function and urinary protein excretion. 2. In patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, dopamine infusion significantly increased urinary sodium excretion (+59%), renal blood flow (+20%) and creatinine clearance (+14%). However, urinary protein excretion was not changed. Addition of atrial natriuretic peptide to the dopamine infusion further increased urinary sodium excretion and maintained creatinine clearance at the same level. In contrast to the infusion of dopamine alone, atrial natriuretic peptide markedly increased urinary protein excretion (77 versus 229 mg min-1 m2, P less than 0.02). Furthermore, the addition of atrial natriuretic peptide elevated the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (1.55 versus 5.35, P less than 0.05), while dopamine alone did not (1.55 versus 1.45, not significant). 3. In essential hypertensive patients, dopamine and dopamine plus ANP showed renal effects similar to those of chronic glomerulonephritis; however, the urinary excretion of protein was not changed significantly. 4. These results suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide may increase urinary protein excretion mainly by increasing the permeability of the damaged glomeruli to protein rather than by simply increasing urine flow or glomerular filtration. Possible mechanisms underlying the proteinuria-increasing effects of atrial natriuretic peptide are discussed. \nTransabdominal and transvaginal sonography of ovarian masses. This chapter outlined the sonographic appearances of most ovarian tumors using both transabdominal and transvaginal sonography. The use of transabdominal and transvaginal sonography for the early detection of ovarian carcinoma seems promising and should be pursued in several institutions as clinical trials. \nLong-term health risks and benefits of oral contraceptive use. The contraceptive effect of oral contraceptive use provides an important health benefit, particularly in developing countries, where the risks of pregnancy and childbearing are increased. Several important noncontraceptive health benefits of oral contraceptive use include the prevention of endometrial and ovarian cancers. Data are generally reassuring concerning the risks of oral contraceptive use, which include cardiovascular disease and breast and cervical cancer. \nMalignant potential of the cryptorchid testis. A follow-up study of 224 male patients from Rochester, Minnesota, diagnosed with cryptorchidism during the period from 1935 through 1974 was conducted to assess the frequency of subsequent testicular neoplasms. Age-specific rates for testicular neoplasm in this community were used to estimate an expected number for comparison with that observed. Two malignant testicular neoplasms have occurred in this cohort; thus, the standardized morbidity ratio was 11.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 41.1). Of the 158 patients born in the community, 11% were known to have birth weights of less than 2,500 g, approximately twice the expected occurrence. Increased risks were also noted for inguinal hernia, hypospadias, Down's syndrome, cleft lip or palate (or both), clubfoot, and congenital heart disease, for which the standardized morbidity ratios were 3.6, 4.7, 17.8, 11.3, 11.7, and 2.7, respectively. The increased risk for malignant neoplasms observed in this cohort of patients with cryptorchidism is consistent with that found in earlier studies. \nEndoscopic transthoracic electrocautery of the sympathetic chain for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis Endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery of the sympathetic chain has been the preferred treatment for palmar or axillary hyperhidrosis in this unit since 1980. A retrospective study was carried out of the first 112 patients with case material derived from a postal questionnaire, chart review and outpatient assessment. Eighty-five patients undergoing bilateral transthoracic electrocautery who replied to the questionnaire (76 per cent response rate) form the basis of this study. There were 65 females and 20 males with a mean age of 24.3 years (range 15-40 years). The hands alone were affected in 20 patients (24 per cent), the axillae alone in 17 (20 per cent) and both areas in 48 (56 per cent). Mean hospital stay was 3.1 days (range 1-7 days). Outcome was assessed by 92 per cent of patients immediately after operation as 'very much improved' or 'moderately improved', and this assessment persisted in 85 per cent after a mean follow-up of 43 months (range 3-95 months). Cosmetic results were rated as satisfactory by 95 per cent. Apart from pain after operation, morbidity was limited to transient Horner's syndrome in three patients, surgical emphysema in three, and pneumothorax requiring a chest drain in one. A repeat procedure was needed in one patient because of an inadequate first operation. Some compensatory hyperhidrosis occurred in 54 (64 per cent) patients. As a minimally invasive procedure, endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery should be considered the treatment of choice for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. \nRare presentation of a parapharyngeal schwannoma. Schwannoma, or neurilemmoma, is included in the differential diagnosis of masses in the parapharyngeal space. Schwannomata do not usually cause acute inflammation, and therefore do not tend to present as emergencies as in this case, in which there was acute respiratory embarrassment. \nPrimary malignant melanoma of male urethra. A case of primary malignant melanoma of the male urethra is reported. Treatment included partial urethrectomy, bilateral inguinal and iliac lymphadenectomy, and post-surgical systemic chemotherapy. After thirty-six months, the patient is alive with cutaneous, pelvic lymph node, and gastric metastases. \nParental sex effect in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Since a parental sex effect has been reported in Huntington's disease, we looked to see whether a similar effect is apparent in adult (autosomal dominant) familial ALS. We analyzed the data for 145 patients, with an onset age range of 20 to 68 years and a known affected parent (AP), from 52 families described in the literature. There was a significant increase in the percentage of patients inheriting the gene from an affected mother as a function of the age at onset. There was also a significant correlation between AP and offspring age at onset only when the AP was the mother. \nCarotid endarterectomy in elderly patients Between 1971 and 1989, 749 carotid endarterectomies were performed at our institution for symptomatic carotid occlusive disease in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these procedures, 693 were done in patients 71 through 80 years of age, and 56 were done in patients between the ages of 81 and 90 years. The neurologic morbidity and perioperative mortality in the former group were 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively, whereas in the latter group the corresponding values were 5.4% and 0%, respectively. For the entire group, the neurologic morbidity was 3.1% and the mortality was 1.3%. Of the 23 new postoperative neurologic deficits, 19 (83%) occurred in high-risk patients with severe preoperative neurologic or medical risks, and 14 (61%) of these deficits were minor. In selected elderly patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusive disease, endarterectomy seems to be a safe procedure that is associated with acceptably low perioperative morbidity and mortality. \nResting energy expenditure in patients with newly detected gastric and colorectal cancers. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured in 104 patients with newly detected gastric or colorectal (GCR) cancer and was compared with two groups of control subjects without cancer: healthy subjects (H control subjects) and patients with nonmalignant diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (GI patients). REE in GCR-cancer patients was not significantly different from REE in GI patients or H control subjects. Comparison of measured REE with predicted REE obtained from prediction equations may erroneously suggest that increased REE is a contributing factor in the development of cancer cachexia. No significant differences in REE were found when patients with liver metastases were compared with patients without metastases. There were no differences in REE between gastric and colorectal cancer patients. The decrease in energy expenditure, which normally occurs during starvation and weight loss in healthy men and women, could not be demonstrated in weight-losing, GCR-cancer patients. In conclu",
