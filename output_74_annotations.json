        "text": "ained. These findings confirm our initial hypothesis and suggest that (1) newly dead infants can be a valuable resource for teaching intubation skills, and (2) others considering a similar approach need to be aware of and sensitive to trainees' feelings. \nReflex anal dilatation: effect of parting the buttocks on anal function in normal subjects and patients with anorectal and spinal disease. Anal dilatation in response to gentle parting of the buttocks has been advocated as a sign of sexual abuse in children, but nothing is known of the physiology of this response or its existence in normal subjects, in patients with spinal disease, and in patients with a weak sphincter and whether it can be elicited after training. To answer these questions we investigated the effect of parting the buttocks on anal function. Combined anal manometry and electromyography was conducted in six normal subjects (five men, one woman, aged 19-53 years), in 18 patients with faecal incontinence (three men, 15 women, aged 30-80 years), and in seven paraplegic patients (six men, one woman, aged 25-36 years), in four of whom the posterior sacral roots had been cut. Parting the buttocks in normal subjects reduced the pressure in the anal canal from 102 (20) to 14 (3) cm H2O (mean (SEM), p less than 0.00001), but did not cause the anus to gape. This drop in pressure was associated with increased electrical activity in the external anal sphincter. Normal subjects could consciously relax the external anal sphincter and reduce the anal pressure but not so as to result in anal gaping during traction on the buttocks, even after anal dilatation. Stimulation of the anal lining by moving a probe in and out of the anal canal increased the activity of the external anal sphincter, raising anal pressures. Paraplegic patients who had lost conscious control of their external sphincters showed anal gaping when the buttocks were parted. \nBlood warming: current applications and techniques. Active blood warming is a recent practice and arises out of conflicting needs. On the one hand, the safety and preservation of blood require refrigerated storage and delivery up to the moment of transfusion. On the other hand, modern methods of very rapid transfusion in resuscitation would cause clinically dangerous hypothermia if unmodified, ice-cold blood were to be so transfused. These needs must be reconciled in the interest of adequate patient care--hence the need for blood warming. Nevertheless, blood warming creates risks of its own and should not be used without justifying clinical indications. Within limits that extend somewhat above normal body temperature, the application of heat does no harm to stored RBC, a fact that is not reflected in current standards for blood warmers. Bearing in mind the human tendency to \"stretch\" standards and the fallibility of mechanical devices, caution is always wise. But perhaps the time has come for reconsideration of the present upper limit of 38 degrees C. Many varieties of blood warmers are available in the US, but none at this time is based on electromagnetic activity. The most common systems now in use are in-line warmers, most of which are not adequate for the type of rapid-transfusion systems currently available. Countercurrent in-line blood warmers and the method of rapid warm saline admixture can both be used successfully for rapid, massive transfusions. Blood warming is seldom necessary or desirable for elective transfusions at conventional rates, even for patients with cold autoagglutinins. \nEchinococcus granulosus cysts in the liver: management with percutaneous drainage. Twenty-one hepatic Echinococcus granulosus cysts (maximal diameter, 7.5 cm +/- 4.0) in 12 patients were aspirated and irrigated with hypertonic (20%) saline under sonographic guidance. All patients had signs and symptoms of a hepatic mass caused by the cysts, which had a prominent fluid component that appeared anechoic or hypoechoic, with marked enhancement of back wall echoes. The amounts of cyst fluid aspirated and of hypertonic saline used were 190 mL +/- 240 and 120 mL +/- 90, respectively. Separation of the endocyst from the pericyst and nonviability of scoleces were observed in all cysts. Mean hospital stay was 4.0 days +/- 3.4. Serial sonographic examinations revealed high-level echoes in the cyst cavity (heterogeneous echo pattern), which ultimately became uniformly echogenic (pseudotumor). After follow-up of 14.0 months +/- 5.5, maximal cyst diameter decreased to 4.1 cm +/- 3.1 (P less than .001). One patient died of unrelated causes; the remaining 11 patients experienced relief of symptoms and a decrease in liver span. \nReduction of canine myocardial infarct size by a diffusible reactive oxygen metabolite scavenger. Efficacy of dimethylthiourea given at the onset of reperfusion. A number of scavengers of reactive oxygen metabolites reduce myocardial injury when given before ischemia and reperfusion, but few, if any, have proven to be effective when given near the onset of reperfusion. This is particularly true when infarct size is measured after at least 48 hours of reperfusion, when the full extent of myocardial damage has become apparent. Dimethylthiourea (DMTU) is an extremely diffusible, potent scavenger of hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorous acid, with a long half-life of 43 hours. Sixteen chloralose-anesthetized dogs underwent 90 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion followed by 48 hours of reperfusion. Collateral flow was measured by radioactive microspheres. Infarct size and risk area were measured by a postmortem dual-perfusion technique using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and Evan's blue dye. In eight dogs, therapy with DMTU (500 mg/kg i.v.) was given during the last 15 minutes of ischemia and the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. In eight control dogs, the same volume of 0.9% saline was given during the last 15 minutes of ischemia through the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. Infarct size as a percent of risk area was reduced in the DMTU-treated group compared with the saline-treated controls (DMTU = 42 +/- 4% versus saline = 59 +/- 4%, p less than 0.01). \nMucosal IgA recognition of Helicobacter pylori 120 kDa protein, peptic ulceration, and gastric pathology. The gastric IgA response to Helicobacter pylori was examined in 100 dyspeptic patients by means of immunoblotting of supernatants from antral biopsy and gastric mononuclear cell cultures. 76 of 78 patients with chronic gastritis, 2 of 8 with reactive gastritis, and 1 of 14 subjects with normal mucosa showed positive responses. Of patients with chronic gastritis, 75%, 83%, 97% and 76%, respectively, showed responses to the 120 kDa, 90 kDa, 61 kDa, and 31 kDa proteins. None of the 19 patients with chronic gastritis who did not recognise the 120 kDa protein had peptic ulcers, whereas 25 of 57 with positive recognition had peptic ulcers (p less than 0.001). Mucosal recognition of the H pylori 120 kDa protein was also positively associated with the activity of gastritis (polymorph infiltration) (p less than 0.002) and with the extent of surface degeneration (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that 120-kDa-positive strains of H pylori have pathogenic features associated with active gastritis and peptic ulceration. Infection with 120-kDa-negative strains may explain why peptic ulceration develops in only a proportion of subjects infected with H pylori. \nSurgical cure of cardiac arrhythmia. 1969. The first surgical procedure undertaken for the intended purpose of curing a patient with recurrent tachycardia was performed by Sealy in 1968, and the report of that operation was published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery in 1969. The first attempted accessory bundle ablation was successful, marked the beginning of cardiac arrhythmia surgery, and has set the standard against which other methods of arrhythmia control must be measured. \nTraumatic esophageal rupture: unusual cause of acute mediastinal widening. We have presented the case of a 32-year-old man who sustained blunt trauma to the chest in a motor vehicle accident. Plain roentgenograms showed a widened mediastinum and pneumomediastinum, and an esophagogram with water-soluble contrast material showed an esophageal laceration at the T-4 level. \nPrognostic factors in invasive bladder carcinoma in a prospective trial of preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy Clinical and pathologic factors were analyzed in 40 patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma treated in a prospective bladder-preserving program consisting of transurethral tumor resection, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine [MCV]), and 4,000 cGy radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin. Patients with biopsy-proven complete response after chemotherapy and 4,000 cGy radiation received full-dose radiotherapy (6,480 cGy) with cisplatin. Cystectomy was recommended to patients with residual disease. Distant metastasis rate was associated with tumor stage and size: 0% in T2 patients, 39% in T3-4 patients (P = .035), 6% for tumors less than 5 cm, and 59% for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm (P = .002). Risk of bladder tumor recurrence was higher in patients with tumor-associated carcinoma in situ (CIS; 40%) than those without CIS (6%; P = .075). Papillary tumors and solid tumors both had similar treatment outcomes. By multivariate analysis, tumor stage T2 (P = .04) and absence of CIS (P = .03) were significant predictors of complete response; CIS was predictive of local bladder recurrence (P = .07); and tumor size (P = .03), response after chemoradiotherapy (P = .02), and vascular invasion (P = .08) were associated with distant metastasis. Six of eight local bladder tumor recurrences were superficial tumors. The low actuarial distant metastasis rate of T2 patients (0% at 3 years), the 3-year actuarial overall survival rates for T2 (89%) and T3-4 (50%) patients, and the similar treatment outcomes for papillary versus solid tumors are encouraging when compared with published historical controls. These results provide preliminary evidence (median follow-up, 30 months) that the current chemoradiotherapy regimen may have beneficial effects in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma. The true efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains to be proven by ongoing randomized trials. \nAnaesthetic-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. A four-year-old deaf girl with a history of convulsions developed polymorphous ventricular tachycardia during induction of anaesthesia. The arrhythmia reverted to sinus rhythm spontaneously. Post-anaesthetic ECG showed marked prolongation of the QTc interval (570-690 msec). Deafness and prolonged QTc interval in association with microcytic-hypochromic anaemia confirmed the diagnosis of the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. This case report highlights the potentially lethal complication of halothane anaesthesia in patients with long QTc interval syndrome. \nN-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids, a class of antiinflammatory agents with a different mechanism of action [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Mar 15;88(6):2612] Several members of a series of N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids were found to possess a broad spectrum of antiinflammatory activity. The compounds were active against oxazolone dermatitis in mice and adjuvant arthritis in rats, models in which activated T lymphocytes are implicated. The compounds also inhibited T-lymphocyte activation in vitro, assessed by using the mixed lymphocyte reaction. The compounds inhibited the reversed passive Arthus reaction in rats and arachidonic acid-induced dermatitis in mice, models in which leukocyte infiltration is responsible for the inflammatory reaction. More complete evaluation was made of one compound, N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl)leucine (NPC 15199). On histologic examination after arachidonic acid administration, NPC 15199 was found to block recruitment of neutrophils into the inflammatory site. The compound was not a general myelotoxin. Prolonged treatment of animals did not alter bone-marrow progenitor number or the numbers of circulating white blood cells. Further, several white cell functions were not inhibited in vitro, including neutrophil respiratory burst and macrophage phagocytosis. NPC 15199 was effective in blocking antigen arthritis in rabbits and was effective in a therapeutic protocol, reversing oxazolone edema. These studies suggest that N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids may be valuable therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases. \n10 year review of invasive aspergillosis detected at necropsy. Between 1980 and 1989, 32 cases of invasive aspergillosis were identified out of 2315 consecutive necropsies, an incidence of 1.4%. The incidence in immunosuppressed \"high risk\" patients was 10.7%. Twenty out of 32 cases showed spread beyond the lungs, with the brain the most common site. There was an increase in cases in the second half of the decade, attributable to the start of a liver transplantation programme. Liver transplant recipients and patients with haematological malignancies were at significantly greater risk of acquiring aspergillosis than kidney transplant recipients or those with solid malignancies treated with chemotherapy. There was also a greater risk of haematogenous dissemination in liver transplant recipients than in all other groups, and this was significantly associated with the use of high dose steroids as anti-rejection treatment. Aspergillus was isolated during life in only eight cases, which indicates a continuing need for and emphasises the value of necropsy. \nAntibodies to cytoplasmic sequences of cloned liver growth hormone (GH) receptors recognize GH receptors associated with tyrosine kinase activity. GH stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of GH receptors in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, and highly purified GH receptor preparations exhibit tyrosine kinase activity. Paradoxically, however, the GH receptor cloned from liver exhibits no sequence similarity to receptors with known signal transduction mechanisms, including those exhibiting ligand-activated tyrosine kinase activity. These observations raise the possibility that there are two kinds of receptors for GH: the first represented by the cloned liver GH receptor, and the second by a tyrosine kinase-containing GH receptor. To inquire into the possibility of two distinct GH receptors, we determined whether the cloned liver GH receptor shares structural similarities with the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor. When the cloned rabbit liver GH receptor is expressed in human kidney 293 cells, it migrates with a mol wt appropriate for the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor, despite the calculated mol wt of the cloned GH receptor being 60,000 smaller than that of the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor. The recognition of tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor by antipeptide antibodies to three different epitopes on the cytoplasmic domain of the cloned liver GH receptor was also tested. Tyrosyl phosphorylated [125I]human GH-receptor complexes were prepared by immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosyl-binding antibody; this subpopulation of GH-receptor complexes was recognized by all three antipeptide antibodies. The antibodies also recognized similarly isolated tyrosyl phosphorylated GH-receptor complexes, which had been further phosphorylated in solution on tyrosyl residues upon addition of [gamma 32P] ATP. Furthermore, highly purified GH receptors prepared by sequential immunoprecipitation using phosphotyrosyl-binding antibody and any one of the three antipeptide antibodies incorporated 32P into tyrosyl residues upon the addition of [gamma 32P] ATP. These results provide evidence that tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptors share sequence similarity in the cytoplasmic domain with the cloned liver GH receptor. The cloned GH receptor and the tyrosine kinase-associated GH receptor, therefore, are likely to be the same receptor or related receptor isoforms. \nMalignant potential of the cryptorchid testis. A follow-up study of 224 male patients from Rochester, Minnesota, diagnosed with cryptorchidism during the period from 1935 through 1974 was conducted to assess the frequency of subsequent testicular neoplasms. Age-specific rates for testicular neoplasm in this community were used to estimate an expected number for comparison with that observed. Two malignant testicular neoplasms have occurred in this cohort; thus, the standardized morbidity ratio was 11.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 41.1). Of the 158 patients born in the community, 11% were known to have birth weights of less than 2,500 g, approximately twice the expected occurrence. Increased risks were also noted for inguinal hernia, hypospadias, Down's syndrome, cleft lip or palate (or both), clubfoot, and congenital heart disease, for which the standardized morbidity ratios were 3.6, 4.7, 17.8, 11.3, 11.7, and 2.7, respectively. The increased risk for malignant neoplasms observed in this cohort of patients with cryptorchidism is consistent with that found in earlier studies. \nAn analysis of sequential physiologic changes in hypoxic cor pulmonale during long-term oxygen therapy. Physiologic changes were studied retrospectively in 37 patients with hypoxic cor pulmonale who died during long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). The subjects were assessed during periods of clinical stability for each year on LTOT. At the onset of treatment, their mean age (+/- SEM) was 60.0 +/- 1.3 years, and at the time of death, they were aged 65.0 +/- 1.3 years. The median duration of LTOT was five years. For each year leading up to death, mean values of FEV1, PaO2, and PaCO2 were obtained. A rate of decline of FEV1 of 73 +/- 10 ml/yr was observed, and this was accompanied by a decline in PaO2 of 0.47 +/- 0.01 kPa/yr. Patients died with a mean FEV1 of 0.55 +/- 0.04 L and a PaO2 of 5.1 +/- 0.2 kPa. A small rise in PaCO2 occurred, on average 0.25 +/- 0.09 kPa/yr, throughout the study, but accelerating in many cases during the three years before death. Hypoxic cor pulmonale appears to be associated with a rapid deterioration in airway function, a steady decline in PaO2, and a slow rise in PaCO2 during the years leading up to death. These physiologic changes measured in a stable clinical state while breathing air appear to occur in spite of LTOT. The LTOT may merely prevent death from episodes of severe hypoxemia while the pathophysiologic changes in the lung progress. Hence the benefit to be expected from LTOT is only temporary. Generally, those patients with lower levels of FEV1 will obtain diminishing clinical benefit, inversely related to the severity of airflow obstruction at the time of commencement of LTOT. \nNon-infective verrucous endocarditis in a patient with 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome. A 27-year-old women with 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome, who developed a haemodynamically significant non-infective verrucous endocarditis is reported. Her mother suffered from antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. A pathogenetic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in heart valve lesions is suggested. \nHomozygous prion protein genotype predisposes to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [published erratum appears in Nature 1991 Aug 8;352(6335):547] The human prion diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome (GSS), are neurodegenerative diseases that are unique in being both infectious and genetic. Transmission of both diseases and the animal spongiform encephalopathies (for example, scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy) to experimental animals by intracerebral inoculation with brain homogenates is well documented. Despite their experimental transmissibility, missense and insertional mutations in the prion protein gene are associated with both GSS and familial CJD, demonstrating that the human familial cases are autosomal dominant diseases. More than 80% of CJD cases occur sporadically, however, and are not known to be associated with mutations. Here we report that 21 of 22 sporadic CJD cases and a further 19 of 23 suspected sporadic CJD cases are homozygous at the polymorphic amino-acid residue 129; 51% of the normal population are heterozygous at this site. We argue that homozygosity predisposes towards sporadic CJD and that this directly supports the hypothesis that interaction between prion protein molecules underlies the disease process. \nRadiation therapy for primary carcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary system. An analysis of 63 cases. From 1976 to 1988, 63 patients received radiation therapy for primary cancers of the extrahepatic biliary system (eight gallbladder and 55 extrahepatic biliary duct). Twelve patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. Chemotherapy was administered to 13 patients. Three patients underwent intraluminal brachytherapy alone (range, 28 to 55 Gy). Sixty patients received megavoltage external-beam radiation therapy (range, 5.4 to 61.6 Gy; median, 45 Gy), of whom nine received additional intraluminal brachytherapy (range, 14 to 45 Gy; median, 30 Gy). The median survival of all patients was 7 months. Sixty patients died, all within 39 months of radiation therapy. One patient is alive 11 months after irradiation without surgical resection, and two are alive 50 months after liver transplantation and irradiation. Symptomatic duodenal ulcers developed after radiation therapy in seven patients but were not significantly related to any clinical variable tested. Extrahepatic biliary duct cancers, the absence of metastases, increasing calendar year of treatment, and liver transplantation with postoperative radiation therapy were factors significantly associated with improved survival. \nCorrelation of the antiproliferative effect and the Mx-homologous protein induction by IFN in patients with malignant melanoma. The human interferon-induced intracellular protein homologous to the murine Mx-protein has recently been identified by means of a specific monoclonal antibody. Three of six melanoma cell lines elicited this intracellular human Mx-homolog upon incubation with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, yet all six melanoma cell lines tested were susceptible to the antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma. Compared per antiviral unit, IFN-gamma had weaker Mx-inducing but stronger antiproliferative activity than IFN-alpha. These data suggest that the IFN-induced Mx-homologous protein is not involved in the antiproliferative action of IFN on malignant melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, 51 patients with advanced malignant melanoma were treated thrice weekly with 10 x 10(6) IU rIFN-alpha-2b and 6 x 10(6) nIFN-alpha, respectively. Nine of the 51 patients experienced systemic objective tumor responses (3 complete response, 6 partial response), but had Mx concentrations in their mononuclear cells equal to the Mx levels of non-responders during IFN-alpha therapy. Therefore, the level of Mx-homologous protein induced during IFN therapy is not a predictive marker for an antitumor response in malignant melanoma. \nA preliminary report of ticarcillin and clavulanate versus triple antibiotic therapy in children with ruptured appendicitis. Standard therapy for childhood ruptured appendicitis includes combination antibiotic therapy with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin. Complicated dosing schedules and the possibility of aminoglycoside toxicity make alternatives desirable. One such alternative is Timentin (a combination agent of ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium). This agent has a more convenient dose schedule than standard therapy and eliminates the possibility of aminoglycoside ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is active in vitro against most pathogens associated with ruptured appendicitis in children. The preliminary results of an ongoing prospective, open label, randomized trial comparing ticarcillin and clavulanate with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin in childhood ruptured appendicitis are reported herein. While further evaluation is necessary, we have found single agent therapy with ticarcillin and clavulanate to be equivalent in safety and efficacy to standard combination therapy. Also discussed are the relative merits of immediate versus delayed primary closure of the abdominal wound after appendectomy. \nSpondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita. Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is a rare condition with several features of concern to the anaesthetist. The patients are of extremely short stature and the presence of kyphoscoliosis may lead to significant respiratory impairment. Cervical vertebral body changes can result in spinal cord compression and laryngotracheal stenosis may be present. The management of such a patient presenting for elective Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia is described. \nPeripheral odontogenic fibroma: a clinicopathologic study. The clinicopathologic features of 30 cases of peripheral odontogenic fibroma are reviewed. The age distribution is wide (11 to 76 years), and there is a slight predilection for males. The majority of the lesions (93%) occurred in blacks on the attached gingiva, and with equal frequency in the maxilla and mandible. Size varied between 1 and 3 cm in diameter. One case recurred after 14 months. Histologically, the lesions are nonencapsulated and poorly delineated. The amount of odontogenic epithelium varies considerably and consists usually of small islands or strands, although larger follicles are sometimes present. In one case the epithelial cells had a clear cytoplasm, whereas in another it was granular and eosinophilic. Origin from the surface oral mucosa can sometimes be seen. The connective tissue component is usually cellular, but collagenous, myxomatous, and mixed forms occur. Calcifications were present in 22 cases and consisted of tissue interpreted as either dentinoid, cementum, bone, or dystrophic calcific material. \nEarly constrictive pericarditis and anemia after Dressler's syndrome and inferior wall myocardial infarction. Early constrictive pericarditis and anaemia developed in a 52 year old man after he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction complicated by Dressler's syndrome. Total pericardiectomy at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery resulted in complete resolution of signs and symptoms. \nSpontaneous hepatic copper accumulation in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats with hereditary hepatitis. A model of Wilson's disease. Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, an inbred strain of a mutant rat isolated from Long-Evans rats, develop hereditary hepatitis. To elucidate the role of copper metabolism in the development of the hepatitis in LEC rats, we examined the copper concentration in the tissues and serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin. Copper concentration in the liver of LEC rats was over 40 times that of normal Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats, while the serum ceruloplasmin and copper concentrations in LEC rats decreased significantly. The hepatocytes of LEC rats show steatosis in cytoplasm and pleomorphism of mitochondria, resembling the histologic features of the liver in Wilson's disease. These findings suggest that the hereditary hepatitis in LEC rats is closely associated with copper toxicity, and may be dealing with a rat form of Wilson's disease. Thus the LEC rats will provide a unique and useful animal model for clarifying the mechanism and for developing treatment strategies for Wilson's disease and other abnormal copper metabolism in humans. \nDietary fiber and bowel function in tube-fed patients. In tube-fed patients, dietary fiber is often used to manage constipation/diarrhea. Dietary fiber consists of water-soluble and insoluble plant compounds that are resistant to digestion by small-bowel enzymes but are fermented to varying degrees by colonic bacteria. Many physiologic effects of fiber may be related to the degree of fermentation. Few controlled studies of fiber-containing tube feedings have been performed. These studies have limitations and are nondefinitive as to whether fiber prevents or controls constipation/diarrhea. Constipation in tube-fed patients has not been shown to respond to mixed soluble/insoluble fiber in the few studies performed to date. Likewise, fiber may be of only limited benefit in controlling diarrhea in acute illness because of such factors as stress or medication. Fiber does play a role in maintaining gut integrity in all patients, whether they have diarrhea or not. Fiber may be recommended as part of a standard tube-feeding regimen to help assure gut mucosal integrity but not specifically to treat constipation/diarrhea. Further studies are necessary before the role of fiber in the management of constipation/diarrhea in tube-fed patients is determined. \nInterrelationship of blood transfusion, non-A, non-B hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis by detection of antibody to hepatitis C virus. To clarify the relationship between hepatitis C virus infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma as sequelae of non-A, non-B posttransfusion hepatitis, 231 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (96 with chronic hepatitis, 81 with cirrhosis and 54 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were analyzed for antibody to hepatitis C virus and were compared with 125 patients with chronic hepatitis B (50 with chronic hepatitis, 46 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 89.6%, 86.4% and 94.4% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis-related chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, compared with 6%, 17.4% and 34.5% with similar diseases related to hepatitis B. A history of transfusion was documented in 52%, 33% and 42% of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean intervals between the date of transfusion and the date of diagnosis of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were 10, 21.2 and 29 yr, respectively. In 21 patients with transfusion-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, anti-hepatitis C virus was present in each serial sample available for testing, including samples obtained up to 14 yr before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These data suggest the slow, sequential progression from acute hepatitis C virus-related non-A, non-B hepatitis through chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma and support a causal association between hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma. \nEfficient management of adrenal tumors. A retrospective analysis was carried out on 121 patients with primary adrenal tumors operated on at 2 Vancouver hospitals between the years 1970 and 1990. The purpose of the study was to identify discriminating factors between the various diagnoses in order to minimize both the time and the cost of the investigative process. There were 57 cortical adenomas, 35 pheochromocytomas, 15 carcinomas, 8 cases of cortical hyperplasia, and 6 miscellaneous tumors. The mean time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis of those patients presenting with an identifiable syndrome was 48.3 months. Those with a hypertensive syndrome presented significantly later than those with Cushing's syndrome (57.7 months versus 22.8 months, p less than 0.01). There was a significant delay in diagnosis in those patients with hypertension on the basis of an aldosteronoma as compared with those with hypertension secondary to a pheochromocytoma (75.4 months versus 36.1 months, p = 0.02). Cortical carcinomas were significantly larger than benign cortical tumors (12.7 cm versus 5.5 cm). No malignant neoplasm measured less than 5 cm in diameter. Diagnostic sensitivity for intravenous pyelogram (IVP) was 59%, for ultrasound 71%, for venography 50%, for meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIGB) (pheochromocytoma only) 80%, and for angiography 70%. However, for those patients with adrenal carcinomas, angiography was positive in 100% of cases. Computed tomography (CT) was the most sensitive localizing investigation with a sensitivity of 98%. While other localizing techniques were less sensitive than CT, they may still play a useful role in selected situations. Factors causing delay in diagnosis and the role of the various imaging modalities are discussed. \nEpicardial coronary artery tone and reactivity in patients with normal coronary arteriograms and reduced coronary flow reserve (syndrome X) The vasomotor response of proximal and distal angiographically normal coronary artery segments was studied in 12 patients with syndrome X, 17 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic stable angina and 10 control subjects with atypical chest pain and a normal coronary arteriogram. Ergonovine (300 micrograms by intravenous injection) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg by intracoronary injection) were administered to all patients. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurement (angiographically normal segments only) was carried out before and after the administration of ergonovine and nitrate. Baseline intraluminal diameters (mean +/- SEM) of proximal and distal coronary segments were not significantly different in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease (proximal 2.88 +/- 0.19, 3.01 +/- 0.13 and 2.86 +/- 0.13 mm; distal 1.57 +/- 0.09, 1.70 +/- 0.10 and 1.61 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively). With ergonovine, proximal segments constricted by 10 +/- 2%, 7 +/- 2% and 11 +/- 3% and distal segments by 12 +/- 3%, 14 +/- 3% and 14 +/- 2% in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively (p = NS). With isosorbide dinitrate, proximal coronary segments dilated by 11 +/- 2%, 10 +/- 2% and 8 +/- 2% (p = NS) and distal segments by 15 +/- 2%, 11 +/- 3% and 13 +/- 2% (p = NS) in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively. Within groups, constriction in response to ergonovine and dilation in response to nitrate were not significantly different in proximal and distal segments. \nSafety of alcohol after viral hepatitis. To test the validity of the generally held belief that moderate consumption of alcohol during convalescence from acute viral hepatitis adversely affects outcome, 87 adults recovering from acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis A in 36, hepatitis B in 34, hepatitis non-A, non-B in 17) were studied. Criteria for entry to the study attempted to ensure that no patient was a chronic hepatitis B carrier. Patients were randomised either to a moderate alcohol intake, or to continued complete abstention. Drinkers consumed 26 g alcohol daily (mean) and none remained abstinent. At 3 months all patients were well, with normal liver function tests. There were no significant differences between the two groups at anytime. The findings suggest that moderate alcohol intake during convalescence from acute viral hepatitis does not seem to be harmful. \nInvolvement of the retinoblastoma gene in primary osteosarcomas and other bone and soft-tissue tumors. The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, thought by some to be associated with tumor formation of retinoblastoma as a recessive human oncogene, was investigated in 57 cases using DNA and RNA from primary osteosarcomas and other bone and soft-tissue tumors. Eight of 23 osteosarcoma cases (35%) showed structural alterations of the Rb gene. Three of the eight demonstrated homozygous deletions, and the remaining five cases showed heterozygous deletions. Seven out of eight cases represented deletion of a 7.5-kb HindIII fragment. Northern blot analysis of five cases of osteosarcoma showed that four demonstrated no detectable Rb gene transcription, and one case had a truncated 3.5-kb fragment with a faint 4.7-kb band. In the other 34 cases of bone and soft-tissue tumors, two cases of three malignant fibrous histiocytomas showed an Rb gene abnormality by Southern blot analysis. These results strongly suggest that Rb gene alteration is pertinent to the tumorigenesis of most osteosarcoma cases and some other bone and soft-tissue tumors. \nIdentification of alloimmunized patients: use of radiolabeled allogeneic platelet kinetic measurements and platelet antibody tests. In a group of stable, nonthrombocytopenic leukemia patients awaiting bone marrow transplantation, results of paired allogeneic radiolabeled platelet kinetic measurements were correlated with the results of several different platelet and lymphocytotoxic antibody tests to determine which parameters could be used to identify patients who were alloimmunized to platelets. Seven patients with acute leukemia who had been transfused during induction therapy were used as the test group, and, as a control group, five untransfused patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were also studied. Concurrent fibrinogen survival measurements were performed in all patients to assess whether hemostatic factor consumption (ie, disseminated intravascular coagulation) was present. Allogeneic platelet survival measurements were reduced from normal in all 12 study patients. In 8 of 12 patients, fibrinogen and platelet survival measurements were comparably reduced, suggesting disease-related platelet consumption. In four heavily transfused patients with acute leukemia, allogeneic platelet survivals were markedly reduced to less than or equal to 2.1 days, compared with the 3.5- to 7.4-day platelet survival measurements found in the other eight patients. The disproportionately short platelet survivals compared with fibrinogen survival measurements in these four patients, combined with documented positive antibody tests to their donors' platelets in the three patients with evaluable tests, suggested that these patients had become alloimmunized to platelets because of their prior transfusions. There was substantial concordance between the two radiolabeled allogeneic donor platelet survival measurements performed in each of these patients, suggesting that host rather than donor factors have a major influence on transfusion outcome (r = .93, P less than .001). The platelet cross-match tests, using the radiolabeled protein Staph A assay combined with the IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, had the best correlation with the posttransfusion recovery and survival of the donors' platelets. \nComparison of IgG antibody profiles by immunoblotting in patients with acute and previous Toxoplasma gondii infection. The IgG antibody profile to Toxoplasma gondii proteins of less than 37 kilodaltons in sera from patients with acute and previous infection was studied by immunoblotting. Bands at 28, 29, and 36 kilodaltons were more common in acute infection (10 out of 10, nine out of 10, and nine out of 10, respectively) compared with previous infection (five out of 10, four out of 10, and one out of 10, respectively). The 6 kilodalton band was present in 10 out of 10 sera from patients with acute infection and five out of 10 sera from those with previous infection. A new observation is a doublet of bands of 22-25 kilodaltons present only in sera from patients with acute infection. This doublet may be a more reliable indicator of acute infection than the 6 kilodalton band. \nEffect of enteral nutrition on exocrine pancreatic function. Twelve patients with chronic pancreatitis underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy in which the pylorus was preserved. The effects of parenteral and enteral nutrition on pancreatic secretion were compared. Postoperative nutrition was administered by needle-catheter jejunostomy in seven patients and by total parenteral nutrition in five patients. Pancreatic juice, drained directly from the pancreatic duct, was collected in 4-hour fractions. Volume, bicarbonate, protein, amylase, and chymotrypsin were measured. In the first two postoperative days, there was a slow increase in all measured indices. On the third postoperative day, an abrupt rise occurred, after which pancreatic secretion stabilized. No differences in exocrine pancreatic secretion were observed between the enteral and parenteral methods of feeding. \nCytogenetic abnormalities associated with renal cell carcinoma. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on 23 renal cell carcinomas (21 sporadic and 2 associated with von Hippel-Lindau's disease). Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in 19 of 21 of the sporadic tumors. The most frequent abnormalities were a loss or rearrangement of material in 3p (11 of 21 cases) or an extra chromosome 7 (7 of 21 cases). Correlation between specific chromosomal abnormalities and clinical presentation was absent with the exception of trisomy 7 and -Y, which occurred only in patients more than 60 years old. An increasing number of cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with a greater likelihood of renal vein and/or capsule involvement. Both patients with von Hippel-Lindau's disease had tumors with a normal karyotype. \nEndothoracic endoesophageal pull-through operation. A new approach to cancers of the esophagus and proximal stomach. Many thoracic surgeons have expressed concern about the complications inherent in transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy. The technique of endothoracic endoesophageal pull-through uses a mucosal coring of normal esophagus beyond the tumor and leaves a muscular tube through which the substitute organ is passed. Mediastinal hemorrhage, tracheal injury, and chylothorax are eliminated. \nEffect of anticoagulant on biocompatibility in membrane plasmapheresis. The effect of heparin or citrate anticoagulation on blood cellular, complement pathway and coagulation pathway was investigated in a membrane plasma exchange procedure. Two membrane plasma separators constructed of cellulose di-acetate (CA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were evaluated with heparin or citrate alone for anticoagulation in a 26 year old male with myasthenia gravis. Maximum white blood cell counts decrease was 21% at 30 min for the CA with heparin while no decrease was observed for the other schemes. Platelet counts changes were comparable between heparin and citrate, while the PVC groups showed less changes than the CA groups. The CA groups, regardless of the type of anticoagulant used, indicated that complement activation occurred via the classical pathway within the module in addition to the activation via alternative pathway for the CA with heparin. In the PVC groups, complement activation was noted to occur only when heparin was used for anticoagulation. PT and PTT showed slight increases with citrate, while they were remarkably prolonged with heparin. Citrate showed less changes in cellular and humoral factors compared to heparin. CA with heparin was the most activating combination of membrane material and anticoagulant, while the PVC with citrate was the least activating combination. \nAn innovative method for neuraxis radiotherapy using partial transmission block technique. Whole CNS (neuraxis) radiotherapy is an important part of therapy for certain CNS tumours which seed via the CSF. Many, if not the majority, of these predominantly young patients are cured but the neuropsychometric, neuroendocrine and growth morbidity of neuraxis radiotherapy on children by conventional methods may be considerable; patients receiving such therapy at an early age often are eventually in the educationally subnormal category. Recent radiobiological data support the concept that all aspects of CNS radiation tolerance are heavily dependent on daily fraction size. We describe a new radiotherapy technique that allows lower daily fraction sizes to be delivered to the neuraxis without prejudicing the total dose to the neuraxis or primary area and without prolonging the overall treatment time. Published radiobiological data support the concept that all the major morbidities attributed to conventional neuraxis radiotherapy will be reduced by the currently described technique without reducing tumour control rates. \nSurgical anatomy of the sacrum. A guide for rational screw fixation. Anterior sacral anatomy was studied to allow safe sacral screw placement. The study included 27 bony sacra. Intrapelvic dissections were performed. Cadaveric specimens were dissected and photographed. The position and angulation of the first sacral foramen was extremely variable. After the position of the L5 root, sacral roots, and iliac vessels, was considered, safe posterior sacral screw implantation could be assured through placement above the level of the first sacral foramen directed medially toward the promontory, parallel to the superior sacral end-plate. Complications of indiscriminate screw placement included L5-root damage, iliac vein penetration, and intractable perineal pain due to sacral root injury. Preoperative computed tomography with the scanner gantry tilted to parallel the superior sacral end-plate defined the great vessels, neural foramens, inclination of the superior sacral end-plate, and prominence of the posterior ileum. Surgical accuracy was evaluated after surgery with computed tomography. \nFacial resurfacing in xeroderma pigmentosum with monoblock full-thickness skin graft. A case of xeroderma pigmentosum with multiple skin tumors on the face that was treated with total excision and replacement of face skin except the eyelids with a monoblock full-thickness abdominal skin graft is reported. The quality and tumor-free features of the monoblock full-thickness skin graft in xeroderma pigmentosum are indicated. Despite the increased morbidity of the donor region, the radical surgical approach advocated here has improved the prognosis in the case reported. \nComparison of dexamethasone and ondansetron in the prophylaxis of emesis induced by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial was done to compare the efficacy and safety of a serotonin receptor antagonist--ondansetron--and dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of acute and delayed emesis and nausea induced by moderately emetogenic non-platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. Patients were treated as outpatients and received intravenous ondansetron 4 mg or dexamethasone 8 mg before chemotherapy and oral maintenance (ondansetron 4 mg every 6 h and dexamethasone reducing from 4 mg to 1 mg 6-hourly between days 1 and 5) for 5 days. 112 patients were treated (38 men, 73 women, 1 with no gender recorded; age range 30-73 years) and 100 were evaluable for cross-over analysis. Patients taking ondansetron or dexamethasone reported no significant difference in complete and major control of acute (83% vs 79%, p = 0.46) or delayed (82% vs 88%, p = 0.214) emesis (vomiting plus retches). Significantly more patients on dexamethasone (87%) than on ondansetron (72%) reported control of delayed nausea (days 2-5) (p = 0.003). Both drugs were well tolerated with no significant difference in the number of adverse events, and this is reflected by similar patient preference for ondansetron (40%) and dexamethasone (30%) (p = 0.244). Both drugs offer adequate out-patient control of chemotherapy-induced emesis; however, dexamethasone has an advantage in the control of delayed nausea, and also in terms of cost and resource allocation. \nMenstrual symptoms in women with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate menstrual symptoms in relation to pelvic pathology. DESIGN--A prospective questionnaire-based study. SETTING--Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Scotland. SUBJECTS--1250 questionnaires were sent out prior to planned admission and 1200 women (96%) brought the completed questionnaires. They comprised 598 women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization, 312 having laparoscopy because of infertility, 156 having laparoscopy because of chronic pelvic pain and 134 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The occurrence of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstrual regularity, premenstrual spotting, deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain in women with either endometriosis and post infective pelvic adhesions or a normal pelvis. RESULTS--Menorrhagia, menstrual irregularity and premenstrual spotting occurred with equal frequency in all groups. Deep dyspareunia, pain after intercourse and recurrent pain unrelated to menstruation or coitus was more common in women with endometriosis and those with post infective pelvic adhesions than in those with a normal pelvis. Dysmenorrhoea appears to be more prevalent among women having endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS--Menstrual symptoms, while raising a high index of suspicion for endometriosis, are not entirely reliable as indicators of disease. Dysmenorrhoea is the most common reported symptom in endometriosis sufferers. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered before institution of treatment in women complaining of pelvic pain and menstrual symptoms. \nIncreased postoperative pain and consumption of analgesics following acupuncture. Acupuncture was given to patients before (preoperative-acupuncture group, PRE-ACU, n = 25) or after (postoperative-acupuncture group, POST-ACU, n = 25) operative removal of impacted mandibular third molars. Sixty patients did not receive acupuncture and participated as a control group (CG). All patients completed a questionnaire in order to characterize state tension and stress, degrees of neuroticism, extroversion, depression and psychosomatic disorders. We also recorded intraoperative discomfort and pain intensity, postoperative pain intensity and consumption of analgesics for 72 h. The PRE-ACU was significantly more tense following surgery and found the operative procedure more unpleasant than the other two groups. The PRE-ACU further rated intraoperative pain intensity higher than the CG and experienced higher pain intensity immediately postoperatively compared with POST-ACU and CG. Of the PRE-ACU patients 15/24 needed additional local anesthesia intraoperatively while none in the POST-ACU or CG requested extra lidocaine. Postoperatively patients in both PRE- and POST-ACU reported a higher total sum of pain scores (pain intensity) and the PRE-ACU consumed more analgesics compared with the CG. A significantly larger number of patients suffering from \"dry socket\" (a complication during wound healing) was found in both PRE- and POST-ACU compared with the CG. No correlation was found between assessed personality characteristics and reported postoperative pain/consumption of analgesics in any group and could thus not explain the observed differences between the groups. The reason for our unexpected \"negative\" findings is unclear but some hypothetical explanations are discussed. \nReduced D2 dopamine and muscarinic cholinergic receptor densities in caudate specimens from fluctuating parkinsonian patients. Binding of spiperone and 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), both labeled with hydrogen 3 (3H), were measured in caudate tissue obtained from 8 living parkinsonian patients at the time of cerebral transplantation. This was clinically homogeneous group of patients. All remained predominantly responsive to levodopa, although with marked disability secondary to clinical fluctuations (short-duration responses) and medication-induced dyskinesias; all were receiving substantial doses of levodopa and 6 of the 8 patients were additionally receiving bromocriptine or pergolide. Binding densities of dopamine D2 receptors, as measured by [3H]spiperone binding, were reduced in this group of patients, compared to caudate specimens from autopsy control subjects. This findings may reflect medication-induced receptor downregulation. Parallel changes occurred with muscarinic cholinergic receptors; [3H]QNB binding was significantly reduced, compared to autopsy control values. This reduction of muscarinic receptors might be due to loss of nigrostriatal terminals that are known to contain muscarinic receptors. Alternatively, muscarinic receptors may have been downregulated by increased corticostriatal glutamatergic input to cholinergic cells, inferred to be present based on the prominent levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Finally, receptor deficits could have been a reflection of more widespread degenerative cerebral disease, although levodopa-refractory symptoms were generally not pronounced in these patients. \nFamilial Ebstein's anomaly: a report of six cases in two generations associated with mild skeletal abnormalities. In a family of 11 persons in three generations six had Ebstein's anomaly. Five of the six showed mild skeletal anomalies--that is, restricted finger extension, with or without limitation of larger joints, and externally rotated little toes. Two other members of the family had the skeletal features without Ebstein's anomaly. The findings suggest a dominantly inherited syndrome of Ebstein's anomaly and skeletal abnormalities. The four female patients were all mildly affected whereas three of the four male patients were severely affected. \nExcimer laser-assisted femoral angioplasty: early results. The ability to ablate atheroma without generating heat makes the excimer laser wavelength a promising intraluminal technique for the treatment of arterial occlusive disease. This series reviews a preliminary experience treating patients with superficial femoral arterial disease admitted with limb-threatening ischemia or claudication. Twenty-six diseased superficial femoral arteries (5 stenotic and 21 occluded) were treated in 23 consecutive patients. Patients with claudication (18) reluctant to undergo bypass or with limb-threatening ischemia (8) at extremely high risk for surgery were included. There were 10 men and 13 women with a mean age of 67 years. A 308 nm excimer laser with an over-the-wire catheter (19) or balloon-centered end-on catheter (7) was used followed by balloon angioplasty. Twenty-four procedures were performed percutaneously, and two were performed with the vessel open in the operating room. Technical success, defined as disobliteration confirmed by angiography and greater than 0.15 increase of the ankle/brachial index, was achieved in 15 of 26. Eleven of 21 occlusions (52%) and four of five stenoses (80%) were opened. Only two of 11 lesions longer than 10 cm were successfully treated. Unsuccessful attempts (technical failure) occurred in 11 of 26 patients and resulted in four elective and one emergency femoral-popliteal bypass. Five patients were discharged with their claudication unchanged, and one had an elective amputation. Six arterial perforations with three arteriovenous fistulas occurred, all resolved without operation. No unanticipated limb loss occurred. In the 15 successful cases, the mean ankle/brachial index increase was 0.34. Seven (47%) of these 15 remain patent with a mean follow-up of 9.5 months (1.5 to 14 months). \nThe transmandibular implant: a 13-year survey of its use. During the period from August 1976 until July 1989 the transmandibular implant was introduced in a total of 31 oral and maxillofacial surgery departments in the Netherlands and 1,466 patients were treated. This study includes 1,356 treated patients from 28 departments. The treatment course of 1,201 patients (89.6%) was uneventful. Of the 157 complications, 58 related to the anatomic contour of the mandible, 49 to the surgery, 25 to the prosthetic reconstruction, 8 to the psychosocial attitude of the patient, 8 to the use of medication, 5 to trauma, and 4 to the presence of a skin graft. Treatment of the complications included removal of the implant in 44 patients; in 106 patients the complication was treated satisfactorily. In the remaining 7 patients, hypesthesia was present. The reasons for the removal of the 44 implants were infection (11), operative error (5), premature loading of the implant (3), insufficient width of the mandible after a visor osteotomy (1), loss of osseointegration caused by the prosthesis (14), psychological problems (4), trauma (3), drug-related gingival hyperplasia (2), and inexplicable pain (1). The present survey shows a consistent success rate of 96.8%. \nSinus of Valsalva aneurysm eroding into the interventricular septum. We report a case of erosion of an aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva into the interventricular septum. The mode of presentation, the preoperative evaluation, and the echocardiographic and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging features are presented, and the cardiac catheterization findings and surgical management of this very rare cardiac pathology are discussed. \nSome perspectives on peptic ulcer. In this article, the author comments on the following topics: whether peptic ulcer is a disease or just the sign of another process; whether the crater has a multifactorial origin; the ubiquity of Helicobacter pylori and the conclusion that a specific strain will doubtless prove to be the cause of some, but not all, ulcers; the inherent definitional problem of \"nonulcer dyspepsia\"; and the controversy over how much gastric acid needs to be reduced to speed the healing of peptic ulcer. \nOverlapping loss of heterozygosity by mitotic recombination on mouse chromosome 7F1-ter in skin carcinogenesis. A significant role for mouse chromosome 7 abnormalities during chemically induced skin carcinogenesis has been advanced based on previous cytogenetic and molecular studies. To determine the frequency of allelic losses at different loci of chromosome 7 in skin tumors induced in the outbred SENCAR mouse stock by a two-stage initiation-promotion protocol, we compared the constitutional and tumor genotypes of premalignant papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas for loss of heterozygosity at different informative loci. In a previous study, these tumors had been analyzed for their allelic composition at the Harvey ras-1 (Ha-ras-1) locus and it was found that 39% of squamous cell carcinomas had lost the normal Ha-ras-1 allele exhibiting 3 or 2 copies of the mutated counterpart or gene amplification. In the present study, by combining Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction fragment length polymorphism analyses, we detected complete loss of heterozygosity at the beta-globin (Hbb) locus, distal to Ha-ras-1, in 15 of 20 (75%) skin carcinomas. In addition, 5 of 5 informative cases attained homozygosity at the int-2 locus, 27 centimorgans distal to Hbb. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA extracted from papillomas devoid of stromal contamination by fluorescence-activated sorting of single cell dispersions immunolabeled with anti-keratin 13 antibody revealed loss of heterozygosity at the Hbb locus, demonstrating that this event occurs during premalignant stages of tumor development. Interestingly, loss of heterozygosity was only detected in late-stage lesions exhibiting a high degree of dysplasia and areas of microinvasion. Analysis of allelic ratios by densitometric scanning of tumors that had become homozygous at Hbb but retained heterozygosis at Ha-ras-1 indicated mitotic recombination as the mechanism underlying loss of heterozygosity on mouse chromosome 7 during chemically induced skin carcinogenesis. These findings are consistent with the presence of a putative tumor suppressor gene linked to the Hbb locus in the 7F1-ter region of mouse chromosome 7, the functional inactivation of which may constitute a critical event in skin tumor progression, possibly during the malignant conversion stage. \nHuman papillomavirus types 16 and 18 in adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. Many reports have shown a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical squamous neoplasia. However, the association of HPV with cervical adenocarcinoma has been studied less extensively. The authors evaluated the presence of HPV-DNA in 106 patients with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix by in situ hybridization, using 35S-labeled probes for HPV 16 DNA and HPV 18 DNA. The overall prevalence of HPV-DNA was 18% (19 of 106). HPV 16 was present in 2 (2%) cases, HPV 18 was observed in 15 (14%) cases, and both HPV 16 and HPV 18 were found in 2 (2%) cases. There was a correlation between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor stage (P less than 0.01) and tumor size (P less than 0.05), but there was no relationship between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor differentiation, proliferation (S-phase fraction), ploidy, lymph node metastases, or five-year survival rate. These results suggest that HPV 18 DNA is associated with cervical adenocarcinoma but the presence of HPV 18 has no influence on overall survival. \nEffects of hypoxaemia and bradycardia on neonatal cerebral haemodynamics. Near infrared spectroscopy has been used to assess the effects of bradycardia and hypoxia on the cerebral circulation in the premature neonate. The technique is well tolerated and can be applied in almost any infant. Continuous monitoring of changes in cerebral oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total haemoglobin is possible. Total haemoglobin is analogous to cerebral blood volume; thus information on circulatory changes as well as oxygenation state can be obtained. Twenty five babies had cerebral monitoring carried out using this technique. During episodes of hypoxia, both spontaneous and induced, impairment of haemoglobin oxygenation within the brain was detected together with an overall increase in the total mean haemoglobin concentration, which was 0.8 x 10(-2) mmol/l. Bradycardia with apnoea also led to impairment of cerebral oxygenation, and to a rapid fall in the concentration of total mean haemoglobin to 1.4 x 10(-2) mmol/l, which was followed in some cases by an increase to above the resting value on recovery of the heart rate to a mean of 0.7 x 10(-2) mmol/l. These disturbances to total haemoglobin concentration represent abnormalities of cerebral blood volume that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neonatal cerebral injury. \nRole of combination drug therapy with a class IC antiarrhythmic agent and mexiletine for ventricular tachycardia. The combination of mexiletine and a class IC antiarrhythmic agent (encainide, propafenone or flecainide) was evaluated by electrophysiologic testing in 14 patients with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia whose tachycardia remained inducible during therapy with the class IC drug alone. During the control drug-free state, all patients had inducible ventricular tachycardia, with a mean cycle length of 260 ms (range 190 to 400). During monotherapy with the IC agent the tachycardia remained inducible in each patient, but there was a significant increase in the cycle length to 340 ms (240 to 500) (p less than 0.001). The effective refractory period of the ventricle was not altered. Treatment with mexiletine (oral in 13 and intravenous in 1) was begun and electrophysiologic testing was repeated. Ventricular tachycardia in one patient was rendered noninducible and one patient had arrhythmia aggravation. The tachycardia in the remaining 12 patients remained inducible but its average cycle length increased further to 392 ms (340 to 460) (p = NS). Nine patients had rate slowing and the average cycle length of the ventricular tachycardia in this group was significantly increased (302 to 388 ms, p less than 0.05). The average effective refractory period was significantly increased during combination therapy (267 ms) compared with no drug therapy (235 ms) and therapy with the class IC drug alone (247 ms) (p less than 0.05). After a mean follow-up interval of 22 months, seven patients continue on the combined treatment and have no ventricular tachycardia. \nCongestive heart failure in diabetes with hypertension may be due to uncoupling of the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor-effector system in the kidney basolateral membrane. Hypertension is known to potentiate the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) in diabetic individuals. Receptor-effector systems for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is known to regulate intracellular calcium (Ca2+), were studied in the kidney during hypertensive-diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats. Animals were divided into four groups: control, diabetic (D), hypertensive (H), and diabetic plus hypertensive (D + H). Diabetes was induced by a streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) injection and hypertension was induced by abdominal aortic constriction; studies were done at 1 and 6 weeks. Plasma ANP was increased at 1 week in the D, H, and D + H groups. There was a significant increase in the activity of Ca2+ + magnesium (Mg2+) adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), which acts as a Ca2+ pump, in the kidney basolateral membrane from D, H, and D + H group at the 1 week study. Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase, on the other hand, was significantly decreased in the D + H group only at 6 weeks. This was associated with a decrease in plasma ANP, an increase in the kidney ANP receptor number, and a decrease in guanylate cyclase activity. The response of the Ca2+ pump to ANP was also attenuated. Since ANP is known to mediate its cellular effects in part by increasing Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase, the observed changes in the D + H group may contribute to the development of nephropathy and CHF. \nGastrointestinal lipoma and malignancies. Twenty gastrointestinal lipomata in 18 patients are reviewed: 15 located in the colon, 3 in the distal ileum, one in the duodenum, and one in the stomach. They were found most frequently in European-born, elderly women and presented with variable abdominal symptomatology. Four lipomata were removed during endoscopy, the remainder at laparotomy, partial colectomy being performed in 10 cases. All, except 2 subserosal types, were located in the submucosa, and their average size was 2.7 cm diameter. Microscopically, none showed true encapsulation, and all were composed of mature fat cells without cellular atypia. In spite of nonspecific changes at endoscopy, one-half of the cases showed, on microscopic examination, atrophy of the overlying glands and a prominent eosinophilic and/or lymphoplasmocytic infiltration of the lamina propria. Two large subserosal lipomata were associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, in 39% of cases, malignant tumours, either single or double, were present in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere. Gastrointestinal \"lipomata\" are located in the sites of normal fatty infiltration in the elderly; these growths could be a local aging or reactive process of the intestinal wall rather than true neoplasms without any potential malignancy. However, coexistent malignancies should be carefully searched for in elderly patients with colonic lipoma. \nAcute abdomen as the first presentation of pseudomembranous colitis. Acute abdomen was the presenting manifestation of pseudomembranous colitis in six men who had previously been treated with antibiotics and presented with abdominal distention, pain, fever, and leukocytosis with absent or mild diarrhea. Plain abdominal radiographs revealed megacolon in two, combined small and large bowel dilation in three, with one of them showing volvuluslike pattern, and isolated small bowel ileus in one. Emergency colonoscopy was performed successfully in all patients and revealed pseudomembranes in five and nonspecific colitis in one. All patients had positive latex test results for Clostridium difficile, and two tested positive for cytotoxicity. All patients were treated with IV metronidazole, resulting in resolution of symptoms and abdominal findings. In addition, two patients underwent colonoscopic decompression with improvement. Endoscopically, complete resolution of the pseudomembranes occurred at 4 weeks in all cases. No patient had a recurrence. It is concluded that (a) pseudomembranous colitis may present as abdominal distention mimicking small bowel ileus. Ogilvie's syndrome, volvulus, or ischemia; (b) in such cases, emergency colonoscopy is safe and useful for diagnosis and therapeutic decompression and may obviate the need for surgery; and (c) treatment with IV metronidazole is effective. Colitis due to C. difficile should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in patients previously treated with antibiotics. \nEndoscopic assessment of mucosal hemodynamic changes in a canine model of gastric ulcer. In studying the side effects of sclerosants injected into the gastric submucosa in dogs (N = 7), we noted that 3 ml of absolute ethanol induced a large gastric ulceration. We describe the time course of change in the ulcer size, and suggest that such ulceration can be used for the endoscopic assessment of factors important in ulcer genesis and healing. Endoscopic reflectance spectrophotometric measurement of indices of mucosal hemoglobin concentration (IHB) and oxygen saturation (ISO2) were performed in a separate group of dogs (N = 4) with ethanol-induced gastric ulceration. We found a significant difference (p less than 0.05) in IHB and ISO2 immediately before (97 +/- 8 and 37 +/- 3, respectively) and after (138 +/- 7 and 21 +/- 5, respectively) the ethanol injection. At 24 hours after the ethanol injection, the IHB at the lesion margin (141 +/- 14) was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that at the adjacent mucosa (101 +/- 4), whereas the ISO2 measurements were not significantly different in these two locations, 34 +/- 2 and 31 +/- 2, respectively. We conclude that (1) injection of 3 mol of absolute ethanol into the submucosa of the canine stomach provides an animal model of gastric ulceration in which the ulcer can be examined repeatedly with the aid of the endoscope; (2) in this ulcer model, ischemia with congestion (increases IHB, decreases ISO2) precedes the development of gross mucosal ulcerations; and (3) the margin of the established ulceration in this model exhibits hyperemia (increases IHB, normal ISO2) which mimics that of a healing gastric ulcer. \nLateral pharyngeal space abscess as a consequence of regional anesthesia. Trismus may be a complication from local anesthesia. Patients with trismus of unknown cause after dental treatment should be evaluated thoroughly. The dentist should perform a complete examination and establish a differential diagnosis to avoid missing a serious or life-threatening infection. A right lateral pharyngeal space infection developed after a general restorative procedure that involved an inferior alveolar nerve injection on the same side. The patient's severe trismus required awake intubation, incision and drainage while the patient was under general anesthesia, treatment with antibiotics and ten days of hospitalization. \nInterdependence of blood pressure and heart period regulation in mild hypertension. Blood pressure and heart period variability have been measured directly in 142 subjects with mild hypertension over 24 h. The variabilities have been expressed as the standard deviation of 2 min averages of all beats over 24 h. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed in 102 subjects by the phenylephrine method. Blood pressure varies over a range of approximately 40% around the mean by day and by approximately 20% at night. The variability of blood pressure by day was inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the baroreflex (r = -0.33, P less than .001), while the variability of heart period was directly related to the sensitivity of the reflex (r = 0.27, P less than .01). Neither of these relationships was significant at night. An inverse relationship between heart period and blood pressure was shown by regression analysis of blood pressure and heart period averages over 24 h. The steepness of the slope of the heart period-systolic blood pressure relationship was strongly correlated with the baroreflex sensitivity (r = -0.55, P less than .001), suggesting that blood pressure variations are substantially buffered by changes in heart frequency. Thus, a more stable heart rate that results from an ineffective baroreflex is associated with a more variable systolic blood pressure. \nBleeding after endoscopic sphincterotomy as an underestimated entity. Hemorrhage is the most frequent complication of endoscopic sphincterotomy, with a reported incidence of 2 to 9 per cent. Previous reports have generally defined this complication clinically, leaving the issue of occult bleeding after sphincterotomy essentially unaddressed. Seventy-five serial sphincterotomies were reviewed to further assess this complication. Nine patients had clinically evident hemorrhage and 27 patients had occult bleeding manifested only by a decrement in hematologic parameters, for a total postsphincterotomy bleeding rate of 48 per cent. No statistically significant risk factors for bleeding were delineated. Endoscopically recognized bleeding at the time of the sphincterotomy was 47 per cent sensitive and 85 per cent specific in predicting postprocedural bleeding. Significant delayed hemorrhage was manifest in three patients, one of whom had clinically occult bleeding. We conclude that bleeding complicates endoscopic sphincterotomy much more frequently than previously reported, although often in a clinically occult manner. Significant delayed bleeding can occur, and may not be clinically apparent. Bleeding recognized endoscopically at the time of sphincterotomy is an insensitive but relatively specific predictor of postprocedural bleeding. As use of endoscopic sphincterotomy increases, careful surveillance for hemorrhagic complications, as well as efforts to identify factors predisposing to the same, will be of increasing importance. \nCorrelation between sexual abuse and somatization in women with somatic and nonsomatic chronic pelvic pain. After a comprehensive clinical and psychological evaluation, 99 women with pelvic pain of at least 6 months' duration and normal findings at laparoscopy were divided into two groups, including 47 women with probable somatic causes of pain (group 1) and 52 women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2). Women without identifiable somatic abnormality (group 2) were younger, had higher mean somatization scores, and reported an earlier mean age at first intercourse, a higher number of total sexual partners, and a higher prevalence of sexual abuse before the age of 20. Within group 2 (nonsomatic pain) but not within group 1, mean somatization scores were significantly higher among women with a history of sexual abuse than among women with a negative history. When analyzed as risks for nonsomatic pelvic pain, the positive predictive value of both a history of sexual abuse and a high somatization score was 78% (relative risk compared with that of women with zero or one risk factor, 2.1; p less than 0.0001). These data suggest that the psychosocial profile of women with nonsomatic pelvic pain differs from that of women with somatic pelvic pain and that previous sexual abuse is a significant predisposing risk for somatization and non-somatic chronic pelvic pain. \nCardiovascular neural regulation explored in the frequency domain. A consistent link appears to exist between predominance of vagal or sympathetic activity and predominance of HF or LF oscillations, respectively: RR variability contains both of these rhythms, and their relative powers appear to subserve a reciprocal relation like that commonly found in sympathovagal balance. In this respect, it is our opinion that rhythms and neural components always interact, just like flexor and extensor tones or excitatory and inhibitory cardiovascular reflexes, and that it is misleading to separately consider vagal and sympathetic modulations of heart rate. In humans and experimental animals, functional states likely to be accompanied by an increased sympathetic activity are characterized by a shift of the LF-HF balance in favor of the LF component; the opposite occurs during presumed increases in vagal activity. In addition, LF oscillation evaluated from SAP variability appears to be a convenient marker of the sympathetic modulation of vasomotor activity. Although based on indirect markers, the exploration in the frequency domain of cardiovascular neural regulation might disclose a unitary vision hard to reach through the assemblage of more specific but fragmented pieces of information. \nPancreatic-portal vein fistula with disseminated fat necrosis treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy. I have reported the case of a 62-year-old man with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and a rare pseudocyst-portal vein fistula. Even though he experienced no abdominal symptoms, he had severe metastatic fat necrosis manifested as subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, medullary bone necrosis, and mental status changes. Remote tissue destruction continued until relief was gained by pancreaticoduodenectomy and repair of the necrotic portal vein. Disseminated fat necrosis is a rare syndrome that can be the only presenting feature in patients with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Early recognition and treatment of the underlying pancreatic disease may decrease the high morality rate associated with this syndrome. \nDirect sequencing from touch preparations of human carcinomas: analysis of p53 mutations in breast carcinomas A new technique for characterizing somatic mutations in very small samples of cellularly heterogeneous human cancer tissue was developed and tested using mutations in the p53 gene in breast carcinomas as a model system. The technique combines touch preparation of specimens to obtain homogeneous clusters of carcinoma cells free of normal cells with a nested pair of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications of DNA to increase the amount of target gene sequence sufficiently to permit direct sequencing of the p53 gene. Touch preparations of fresh or previously frozen tissue from human adenocarcinomas derived from several organs were stained, and clusters of 10-50 malignant cells were transferred by pipette into microfuge tubes for PCR amplification. Exons 5-9 of the p53 gene, which contain the major mutational hot spots associated with most human cancers, were sequenced by the following steps: 1) two rounds of PCR amplification using DNA Taq polymerase and two sets of oligonucleotide primers, the second set being nested within the segment amplified by the first set and having attached T7 and SP6 phage promoter sequences, 2) transcription of the amplified DNA sequences with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases, and 3) dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded RNA transcripts with reverse transcriptase and with additional oligonucleotide primers to achieve specificity for this unique region of the genome. The utility of this approach is illustrated by our success in detecting and analyzing point mutations in cell clusters from four of 11 primary adenocarcinomas of the human breast. \nChanging pattern of bone and joint infections due to Staphylococcus aureus: study of cases of bacteremia in Denmark, 1959-1988. Of the 15,170 cases of bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus that occurred in Denmark between 1959 and 1988, we review 525 cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis and 185 cases of septic arthritis that developed subsequent to the bacteremia and 134 cases of contiguous osteomyelitis in which the bacteremia developed secondarily. The pattern of acute infections of bones and joints has changed over the three decades studied. The frequency of secondary bone or joint infections due to S. aureus bacteremia has changed, as have the phage-type pattern and antibiotic resistance of the infective strains. The prevalence of hospital-acquired cases has increased and the age distribution of patients has changed, as is reflected in an increasing number of older patients. The localization of hematogenous osteomyelitis has shifted, and the vertebral column is now the most common site of infection. The rate of chronic cases of osteomyelitis that occur following acute hematogenous osteomyelitis has been reduced from 34% to 6%. The mortality associated with S. aureus bacteremic infections of bones or joints is low compared to that associated with other cases of S. aureus bacteremia. \nGeneralized pustular psoriasis. A review of 63 cases. BACKGROUND--Sixty-three patients with generalized pustular psoriasis were hospitalized during a 29-year period. They were classified into four subgroups on the basis of onset and morphologic pattern of disease: acute (von Zumbusch), subacute annular, chronic (acral), and mixed. This division provides a better understanding of the variability of the disease and helps in choosing treatment. OBSERVATIONS--The average age at onset was 50 years; male and female patients were affected about equally. In 11 patients, flares were precipitated by localized infections. Approximately one fourth of the patients had complications; most were superinfections. The average stay in the hospital was 30 days; factors correlating with a long hospitalization were hypocalcemia, female sex, and a previous history of psoriasis vulgaris or pustular psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS--Whereas topical therapy was helpful, systemic medications were often needed. Coal tar, ultraviolet light, and psoralen-ultraviolet A may be effective; however, they must be used with caution, because they may exacerbate the disease. \nHormone replacement therapy in general practice: a survey of doctors in the MRC's general practice research framework. OBJECTIVES--To survey current prescribing practice for hormone replacement therapy among general practitioners and to elicit their views on the role of hormone replacement therapy in the prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease; to determine whether they would participate in randomised controlled trials to evaluate the long term beneficial and adverse effects of hormone replacement therapy. DESIGN--Postal questionnaires to general practitioners throughout the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS--1268 general practitioners in the Medical Research Council's general practice research framework. RESULTS--1081 (85%) doctors in 220 (95%) practices responded. The doctors were currently prescribing hormone replacement therapy to an estimated 9% of their female patients aged 40 to 64, and 55% of doctors were prescribing opposed hormone replacement therapy (oestrogen plus progestogen) to more patients than a year previously. Over half the doctors would consider prescribing hormone replacement therapy for prevention of osteoporosis (670, 62%) and cardiovascular disease (611, 57%) to asymptomatic women. Overall, 79% of the doctors (851) would definitely or probably consider entering women who have had a hysterectomy into a randomised controlled trial comparing unopposed (oestrogen only) hormone replacement therapy with opposed hormone replacement therapy; 49% (524) would enter patients with a uterus into such a trial. Among a subsample, 85% (180/210) would consider entering patients without menopausal symptoms into a trial comparing hormone replacement therapy with no treatment (unopposed in patients who have had a hysterectomy, opposed in those with a uterus). CONCLUSION--There is considerable uncertainty among general practitioners as to the balance of beneficial and harmful effects of hormone replacement therapy in the long term, particularly relating to its use for prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Most of these doctors would be prepared to participate in randomised controlled trials to determine the long term effects of this increasingly widely used treatment. \nCoronary patency, infarct size and left ventricular function after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction: results from the tissue plasminogen activator: Toronto (TPAT) placebo-controlled trial. TPAT Study Group Infarct size, left ventricular function and infarct-related coronary artery patency were examined in 108 patients who took part in a previously reported placebo-controlled trial of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography was performed 17 +/- 0.8 h after initiation of treatment in 47 patients (group A) or at 10 days in 61 patients (group B). Both groups underwent radionuclide ventriculography 3.8 +/- 0.8 h and again on day 9 after treatment and quantitative thallium scintigraphy on day 8. In group A, the infarct-related artery was patent in 53%; these patients had a smaller global (15.1 +/- 2.5% vs. 25.7 +/- 4.7%, p = 0.029) and regional (14.7 +/- 2.5% vs. 24.1 +/- 4.7%, p = 0.044) fixed thallium defect than did those with an occluded artery. Infarct regional ejection fraction improved by 10.1 +/- 2.1% between early and late studies when the infarct-related artery was patent and by 4.8 +/- 1.4% if it was occluded (p = 0.048); changes in global and noninfarct regional ejection fraction were similar irrespective of perfusion status. Infarct regional ejection fraction and fixed thallium defect were inversely related only when the infarct-related artery was occluded (r = -0.83, p less than 0.0001). In group B, 10 day patency of the infarct-related artery was 67%; there was no difference in patency by treatment assignment or in left ventricular function or infarct size between patients with and without infarct-related artery patency. There was no evidence of an effect of rt-PA therapy beyond that expressed through coronary patency alone in either group A or group B. \nCT and pathologic predictive features of residual mass histologic findings after chemotherapy for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors: can residual malignancy or teratoma be excluded? Forty-eight patients with disseminated nonseminomatous germ cell tumors were studied retrospectively to determine whether initial pathologic features and pre- and post-chemotherapy computed tomographic (CT) features could be used to exclude malignancy or teratoma in residual masses that were excised after chemotherapy. Neither CT findings (residual mass size, attenuation, and degree of shrinkage during chemotherapy) nor type of primary testicular tumor cell was significantly correlated with malignancy or teratoma versus necrosis in residual masses. No significant correlation was demonstrated between the combined features of (a) the absence of teratoma in a histologic specimen of the primary testicular tumor and (b) greater than 90% shrinkage of masses during chemotherapy and the absence of malignancy or teratoma in residual masses as suggested in the literature. Of nine patients with both of these findings, two had malignancy and two had teratoma. Radiographic and pathologic features cannot be used to reliably exclude malignancy or teratoma in residual abdominal masses after chemotherapy for nonseminomatous testicular cancer. \nPrimary soft tissue tumours of the pelvis causing referred pain in the leg. Referred pain in the leg is occasionally due to a pelvic soft tissue tumour. Among 11 patients who presented this way, one had a lymphoma, one had a benign schwannoma, and nine had soft tissue sarcomas. Most patients had undergone a variety of procedures, including laminectomy, before the correct diagnosis was established. In five cases, an accurate diagnosis was obtained by needle biopsy. The lymphoma responded to chemotherapy, and the benign schwannoma was excised. Of the nine patients with soft tissue sarcoma, six underwent marginal/intracapsular excision, three receiving supplementary radiotherapy, and two were treated by nonsurgical means. Hindquarter amputation was technically impossible or inappropriate in these cases. All those with high-grade tumours have died or have metastases. Of four patients with low-grade tumours, three have exhibited only slow disease progression. Careful judgment and a precise histopathological diagnosis are required in planning treatment for patients with pelvic soft tissue tumours causing referred pain in the leg. \nPrevalence and prognostic significance of silent and symptomatic ischemia after coronary bypass surgery: a report from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized population. The prevalence and prognostic significance of postoperative myocardial ischemia, as detected by exercise testing, were prospectively assessed in 174 patients from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized surgical population who had exercise testing before and 6 months after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Whereas the prevalence of symptomatic ischemia significantly decreased postoperatively (52% vs. 6%, p less than 0.001), the frequency of silent myocardial ischemia did not change (30% vs. 29%). Survival at 12 years after bypass surgery based on the 6-month postoperative exercise test results was significantly better for the 112 patients with no ischemia (80%) than for the 51 patients with silent ischemia (68%) or the 11 patients with symptomatic ischemia (45%). These data show that coronary artery bypass graft surgery diminishes the overall prevalence of symptomatic but not silent ischemia and that both silent and symptomatic ischemia adversely affect the postoperative prognosis of these patients. \nGenetic predisposition to iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The spongiform encephalopathy Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has been transmitted to man via administration of growth hormone and gonadotropin extracted from large pooled batches of human cadaveric pituitary glands. In the UK, 1908 individuals were exposed to potentially contaminated growth hormone, of whom 6 have so far manifested CJD. Examination of the prion protein genes of all these cases and of a single case of gonadotropin-related CJD showed that 4 had the uncommon valine 129 homozygous genotype indicating genetic susceptibility to prion infection. Such genetic susceptibility may be important in the aetiology of sporadic CJD disease. \nThe mast cell in health and disease. The presence of mast cells, often in an activated state or increased numbers, has been noted in various cutaneous disorders. Recent studies suggest that mast cells are of primary importance in these conditions and their presence does not merely represent a secondary event. This review focuses on atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity reactions, bullous pemphigoid, fibrosing conditions, neurofibromatosis, wound healing, polycythemia vera, and psoriasis, in which there is significant evidence to indicate a pathophysiologic role for mast cells. \nEvaluation of restenosis after balloon dilatation in adult aortic stenosis by repeat catheterization. To evaluate the restenosis rate after successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty, clinical evaluation and repeat catheterization were performed in 96 patients who had undergone balloon dilatation 7 +/- 5 months earlier. Restenosis, defined as a loss of greater than 50% of the benefit in aortic valve area obtained after balloon valvuloplasty, was observed in 48% of the patients. Actuarial analysis showed that the restenosis rate was time dependent and was 80% at 15 months. However, functional improvement was observed in most of the patients with or without restenosis. The restenosis rate was not correlated with the degree of enlargement of the aortic orifice produced by the valvuloplasty procedure. Because of the high incidence of restenosis, balloon aortic valvuloplasty should be limited to patients who have a contraindication to surgery or are at high risk for surgery, or as a bridge to surgery. \nMetabolic consequences of (regional) total pancreatectomy. Little information has been reported on the metabolic characteristics of the totally pancreatectomized patient or the efficacy of medical management after radical pancreatic surgery. The prospective evaluation of 49 such patients, with 31% followed for 48 or more months, forms the basis of this report. The major immediate postoperative challenge is control of diarrhea and weight stabilization. Chronically patients have an increased daily caloric requirement (mean +/- SE, 56 +/- 1 kcal/kg), not wholly explained by moderate steatorrhea (fecal fat excretion, 16% +/- 2% of unrestricted fat intake). Despite persistent malabsorption, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamin, magnesium, and trace element serum levels can be prevented in most patients. Pancreatogenic diabetes is characterized by (1) absence of the major glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon, (2) instability, and (3) frequent hypoglycemia, with the latter parameters improving with rigorous home glucose monitoring. No patient has developed clinically overt diabetic micro- or macrovascular disease. Performance status in long-term survivors has been reasonable. However adverse chronic sequelae of the operation occur and include an unusual frequency of liver disease, characterized by accelerated fatty infiltration, and osteopenia, with an 18% reduction in radial bone mineral content noted in pancreatectomized patients studied more than 5 years after surgery. \nA method for estimating catechol estrogen metabolism from excretion of noncatechol estrogens. The relationship of catechol estrogen metabolism to disease has seldom been investigated because of analytic difficulties. Estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) are oxidized simultaneously at either ring A or ring D, and the rate of catechol estrogen formation (r2) is reciprocally related to the rate of 16 alpha-hydroxylation (r3). The rate of ovarian estrogen production (X10) can be summarized as to metabolic outcome: X10 = r10 + r2 + r3 + r(u), where r10 is the loss of E1 and E2 in urine, and ru is the fecal and urinary loss of unknown oxidative products. Assuming a constant r(u) between subjects: constancy of the X10 concentration between subjects during similar menstrual cycle phases. In the absence of xenobiotics, r2 x r3 are reciprocally interrelated: r2 x r3 = K (an oxidation constant whose limiting factor is the biologically available estrogen at the cell surface). To the extent that r10 approximates estrogens available for cellular metabolism, the rate of catechol estrogen metabolism may be determined from (Formula; see text) From published data K = 12.4 +/- 0.8 of the standard error of the mean. Pearson correlation coefficients between actual and estimated catechol estrogen excretion in groups of subjects ranged from 0.61 to 0.97 (median, 0.88). This method has been useful for clinical investigation of the relationship of catechol estrogen metabolism to disease until better methods to measure catechol estrogen directly are available. \nAn autopsy study of the incidence of lacunes in relation to age, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. We investigated selected features of lacunes in 1,086 necropsy cases. Lacunes were found in brains from patients above the age of 40 years and were most common in brains from persons in their sixties but decreased in number in brains from older persons. The most common site of lacunes was the frontal lobe white matter, followed by the putamen, pons, parietal lobe white matter, thalamus, and caudate nucleus in descending order of frequency. By dividing the 1,086 cases into three groups according to blood pressure, we found more lacunes in the hypertensive and borderline hypertensive groups than in the normotensive group; the average number of lacunes per brain in each group was 3.61, 2.77, and 1.15, respectively. Diastolic hypertension was more closely related to the number of lacunes than was systolic hypertension. The extent of arteriolosclerosis of the medullary arteries in the frontal lobe white matter was measured and compared with the number of lacunes. There was a close correlation between lacunes and arterioloslerosis in all age groups. \nTransoral decompression evaluated by cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging: a case of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation. Cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging provides simultaneous images of cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics. A patient with a basilar impression accompanied by a Chiari malformation and von Recklinghausen's disease who underwent transoral decompression is reported. Preoperative cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging visualized an associated obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid pulsatile flow at the level of the foramen magnum. Tonsilar herniation (Chiari I malformation) and hydrocephalus were also present. Postoperatively, the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow was resolved concomitant with the correction of the cervicomedullary angulation. On the basis of observations made by magnetic resonance imaging, the surgical treatment of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation is briefly discussed. \nTreatment of recurrent urethral strictures using clean intermittent self-catheterisation. The treatment of urethral strictures has been greatly improved by the use of the optical urethrotome. However, there remains a group of patients with recurrent strictures for whom the alternatives remain long-term dilatation/urethrotomy or urethroplasty. Over the last 3 years we have treated 65 such patients using clean intermittent self-catheterisation as a method of self-dilatation. This has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of operations performed on these patients, with no significant reduction in urinary flow rate over an average follow-up period of 20 months. The method offers the possibility of long-term cure and should be offered to all all such patients, reducing still further the number of patients who require urethroplasty. \nImmunoturbidimetric assay for estimating free light chains of immunoglobulins in urine and serum. An immunoturbidimetric assay for the assessment of free kappa and lambda light chains of immunoglobulins was developed using a commercial polyclonal antiserum with reactivity towards epitopes on the light chains, which are not expressed when they are bound to heavy chains. The assay, on a centrifugal analyser, is simple and rapid. The limit of detection is 5 mg/l of free light chain, with an assay range of 5-120 mg/l, intrabatch precisions from 1.5-6.4%, and interbatch precisions from 6.5-8.9%. The assay was only slightly less sensitive than colloidal gold staining of cellulose acetate electrophoreses for the detection of Bence-Jones protein in urine. For the serial monitoring of response to chemotherapy in patients with myeloma, the assay correlated well with serum paraprotein estimates obtained by densitometric scanning of Ponceau stained cellulose acetate electrophoreses, but not with serum beta-2 microglobulin measurements, even after correction for the effects of creatinine. These assays may prove to be of use for the monitoring of tumour response in the treatment of Bence-Jones myeloma. \nAvoidance of tolerance and lack of rebound with intermittent dose titrated transdermal glyceryl trinitrate. The Transdermal Nitrate Investigators. OBJECTIVES--To investigate the efficacy of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate given continuously and with a nocturnal nitrate free period. DESIGN--Double blind placebo controlled study with two parallel limbs. SETTING--Multicentre trial. PATIENTS--52 patients randomised to receive either continuous treatment (23 patients) or intermittent treatment with an individually titrated dose (29 patients) for 14 days: both treatments were compared with placebo in a cross-over fashion. INTERVENTION--Continuous treatment with 10 mg per 24 hours of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate or intermittent transdermal glyceryl trinitrate titrated to give an arbitrary 10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure (mean dose 18.2 mg) given over approximately 16 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Treadmill exercise stress testing and ambulatory monitoring of the ST segment after 14 days' treatment. RESULTS--After 14 days' intermittent treatment resting supine and standing systolic blood pressure fell by 7.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 12.2) and 9.0 mm Hg (95% CI 3.4 to 14.5) respectively (p less than 0.01); resting heart rate was unchanged. Mean heart rate at 1 mm ST segment depression rose by 11.9 beats/min (CI 1.1 to 23.7) (p less than 0.05), mean time to onset of angina increased by 59 seconds (CI 10.8 t",
