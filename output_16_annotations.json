        "text": " lymphoma versus toxoplasmosis in AIDS. The imaging studies of 16 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and proved primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma were reviewed. All studies included computed tomography (CT); six also included magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. A periventricular lesion was seen in 50% of patients. At least one such lesion exhibited subependymal spread or ventricular encasement in 38%. One-third of lesions in three of five patients who underwent nonenhanced CT were hyperattenuating. Five lesions were at least in part hypointense on T2-weighted MR images. The specificity of these findings was evaluated with a similar review of the imaging studies in 28 patients with AIDS and proved toxoplasmosis. Only 3% of lesions were periventricular. None exhibited subependymal spread or encasement. None were hyperattenuating on nonenhanced CT scans. Similar findings in other CNS lesions in AIDS patients could not be found in the literature. A focal enhancing mass with subependymal spread on CT or MR images and hyperattenuation at nonenhanced CT were the most reliable features in distinguishing between primary CNS lymphoma and toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients. \nPredictive accuracy of electrophysiologic localization of accessory pathways. Operative ablation of accessory pathways depends critically on preoperative localization when technical limitations preclude complete intraoperative mapping. To assess the accuracy of localization, 345 patients undergoing operative ablation were studied; 316 (91.6%) had a single accessory pathway and 29 (8.4%) had multiple accessory pathways. The electrophysiologic study was diagnostically complete and accurate in 294 patients (93%) with a single accessory pathway and 19 (61%) with multiple accessory pathways. A left lateral accessory pathway was most accurately localized with excellent sensitivity (99%) and positive predictive value (98.5%). Diagnostic errors occurred in 33 patients because of 1) incorrect localization (n = 16), 2) failure to detect a second pathway (n = 9), and 3) diagnosis of a second pathway not verified intraoperatively (n = 8). Multiple pathways were more prevalent in the group with errors (33.3% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.0001), as were unidirectional pathways (48.5% vs. 24.3%, p = 0.003). It is concluded that preoperative localization of accessory pathways is sufficiently accurate to allow intraoperative mapping to be brief and focused. \nIndex for optimum ventricular catheter length. Technical note. The optimum length of a ventricular catheter to be placed in a particular patient may be difficult to determine when either intraoperative ultrasound is not available or considerable time has elapsed between the diagnostic computerized tomography scan and the operation. An index for estimating ventricular length based on the head circumference of the individual is described. This method was tested clinically and proved to be successful. \nThe influence of gender on the susceptibility to multiple sclerosis in sibships. A population-based study of pairs of relatives (siblings, second- and third-degree) concordant for multiple sclerosis did not show an excess of like-sexed pairs. In addition, data on human lymphocyte antigen typing for sibling pairs concordant for multiple sclerosis did not find an increase in haplotype sharing for like-sexed pairs. These data do not support the notion that sex-related factors influence multiple-sclerosis susceptibility in families. \nIntermittent short-term negative pressure ventilation and increased oxygenation in COPD patients with severe hypercapnic respiratory failure. With the aim of testing a method that allows increasing concentrations of oxygen to be administered to patients with severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia while avoiding the risk of increasing respiratory acidosis, we studied 17 male patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe hypercapnic respiratory failure. During 6 h and on one day only, all patients were given intermittent negative pressure ventilation (INPV) together with oxygenation starting at a concentration of 24 percent and increasing to 30 percent. Using this procedure, it was possible to raise arterial PaO2 to safe levels (from 47.2 +/- 3 mm Hg to 61.5 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) without increasing hypercapnia, and a significant drop in PaCO2 levels (from 74.4 +/- 9 mm Hg to 65.6 +/- 12 mm Hg, p less than 0.005) was even observed. One hour after INPV ended, the mean values of PaO2, PaCO2, oxygen saturation, and pH were also significantly better than prestudy values. We conclude that INPV and oxygen therapy with increasing oxygen flow could constitute an alternative option to intubation and mechanical ventilation in cases of severe hypercapnic respiratory failure due to advanced COPD. \nSustained ventricular tachycardia associated with sarcoidosis: assessment of the underlying cardiac anatomy and the prospective utility of programmed ventricular stimulation, drug therapy and an implantable antitachycardia device. The presentation, cardiac anatomy and utility of programmed ventricular stimulation in seven patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia associated with sarcoidosis are described. The mean patient age was 38 +/- 8 years. Pulmonary involvement was apparent in three patients and no systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis were present in one patient. All patients had electrocardiographic abnormalities at rest and six had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%. All seven patients had left ventricular wall motion abnormalities and five had mitral valve dysfunction. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was easily induced in all patients. Spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia was not prevented with corticosteroid administration. Despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy, two patients had sudden cardiac death and an additional four had recurrence of ventricular tachycardia. Four patients had an automatic cardioverter-defibrillator implanted and received drug therapy; all four received appropriate shocks. This report represents the largest descriptive series of consecutive patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia associated with sarcoidosis. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy of ventricular tachycardia in patients with sarcoidosis, even when guided with programmed ventricular stimulation, is associated with a high rate of arrhythmia recurrence or sudden death, or both. Thus, implantation of an automatic antitachycardia device (cardioverter-defibrillator) should be considered as primary therapy in such patients. Furthermore, sarcoidosis should be excluded, with Kveim skin testing if necessary, in any patient with sustained ventricular tachycardia of unknown origin. \nDetection of DNA sequence polymorphisms by enzymatic amplification and direct genomic sequencing. The discovery of RFLPs and their utilization as genetic markers has revolutionized research in human molecular genetics. However, only a fraction of the DNA sequence polymorphisms in the human genome affect the length of a restriction fragment and hence result in an RFLP. Polymorphisms that are not detected as RFLPs are typically passed over in the screening process though they represent a potentially important source of informative genetic markers. We have used a rapid method for the detection of naturally occurring DNA sequence variations that is based on enzymatic amplification and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. This approach can detect essentially all useful sequence variations within the region screened. We demonstrate the feasibility of the technique by applying it to the human retinoblastoma susceptibility locus. We screened 3,712 bp of genomic DNA from each of nine individuals and found four DNA sequence polymorphisms. At least one of these DNA sequence polymorphisms was informative in each of three families with hereditary retinoblastoma that were not informative with any of the known RFLPs at this locus. We believe that direct sequencing is a reasonable alternative to other methods of screening for DNA sequence polymorphisms and that it represents a step forward for obtaining informative markers at well-characterized loci that have been minimally informative in the past. \nIncidence and prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Harris County, Texas, 1985-1988. The incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was determined in Harris County, Texas, for the period 1985 through 1988. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases were ascertained from four sources: area neurologists, hospitals, death certificates, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association. The age-adjusted incidences of 1.27 per 100,000 person-years in males and 1.03 per 100,000 person-years in females were lower than recent rates in the northern US, Canadian, and northern European studies but higher than rates in southern European studies. Comparisons with other recent incidence studies show less uniformity in occurrence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in both the overall rates and in the age- and sex-specific patterns, than was suggested by mortality studies. The incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis among blacks and whites was similar. Hispanic males had incidences similar to white males, although a deficit of female Hispanic cases was found in Harris County. The prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis peaked in the 65- to 74-year age group at 33 per 100,000 population among males and 19 per 100,000 population for females. \nExtensive hepatic granulomas associated with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. A case of T-cell lymphoma presenting with marked hepatosplenomegaly and extensive hepatic granulomas is described. A 55-yr-old female experienced long-term liver damage showing histological triaditis with atypical lymphoid cell infiltration and erythrophagocytosis. The patient developed marked hepatosplenomegaly and eventually died of respiratory failure. Neither systemic lymphadenopathy nor hematological disorder was noted until her death. Autopsy revealed small atypical lymphoid cells positive for T-cell marker, as well as extensive infiltration of generalized organs, including the liver, spleen, and lungs. As a result of diffuse proliferation of atypical lymphoid cell admixed with variable reactive cells, mainly at the T-zone, the lymph nodes underwent effacement of normal architecture; however, the peripheral sinuses and the fibrous capsule remained relatively well preserved. These histological features were consistent with a diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL). It is interesting to note that there were numerous epithelioid granulomas admixed with a small number of atypical lymphoid cells within the hepatic parenchyma. The atypical lymphoid cells may be responsible for the granulomatous reaction in the liver. To our knowledge, there have been no other reported cases of PTL that presented with numerous epithelioid granulomas confined to the liver. \nPerivalvular extension of infection in patients with infectious endocarditis. Perivalvular extension of infection is a not-infrequent and potentially fatal complication of bacterial endocarditis. Because the efficacy of various modalities in the diagnosis of such complications is not well established, a selective review of the published literature on this issue is worthwhile. The electrocardiogram is the easiest study to obtain. It is quite specific in identifying perivalvular extension of infection when conduction system disease is demonstrated but has a low degree of sensitivity overall. Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and color-flow Doppler echocardiography are the most practical and useful techniques for diagnosis of perivalvular extension of infection. Magnetic resonance imaging also appears to be an effective tool in this setting; however, because of a paucity of clinical data, its precise utility has not yet been determined. Nuclear medicine studies and computed tomography play a minimal role. Cardiac catheterization is as useful as the echocardiographic techniques but is invasive, not as readily available, and significantly riskier in terms of complications. An approach to the diagnosis of perivalvular extension of infection is proposed on the basis of the literature review. \nMicrovascular angina. Cardiovascular investigations regarding pathophysiology and management. A significant minority of patients with chest pain who undergo cardiac catheterization are found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries. Over the past 25 years, several studies have shown that a subset have demonstrable abnormalities in coronary flow and cardiac function; however, only a minority of these patients have convincing evidence for myocardial ischemia during stress, and alternative mechanisms have been explored to explain the frequent and debilitating symptoms of pain experienced by the majority of these patients undergoing study. Abnormal visceral nociception appears to be a fundamental abnormality in this population, whether or not demonstrable abnormalities in coronary flow or cardiac function can be demonstrated. \nBazex syndrome (acrokeratosis paraneoplastica). An analytic review. Bazex syndrome (acrokeratosis paraneoplastica) is characterized by a psoriasiform eruption that favors acral sites and has been associated with an underlying malignancy in all reported cases. Of the 93 patients in this series, 89 were male with a mean age of 60 +/- 8.5 years. Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and squamous cell tumors of unknown primary with cervical lymph node metastases were the most commonly associated neoplasms, suggesting that the factor(s) responsible for the development of the syndrome are relatively specific for tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract. The cutaneous lesions were erythematous to violaceous in color and had associated scale; the most frequently observed sites of involvement were the ears, nose, hands, and feet, including the nails. In 63% of the cases, the cutaneous lesions preceded the initial symptoms or diagnosis of the tumor by an average of 11 months (range, 1-72) and, in general, the eruption was resistant to a variety of topical treatments. Occasionally, a reappearance of the papulosquamous lesions signaled the recurrence of the tumor (6 cases) or the appearance of skin lesions coincided with the development of metastatic disease (3 cases). In 91% (64/70) of the patients, the skin eruption either improved significantly following treatment of the underlying malignancy or did not improve in the setting of persistent tumor. However, even when all of the skin lesions cleared, the nail dystrophy often persisted. Fifteen of the patients developed vesicles, bullae, and crusts in addition to papulosquamous lesions. Possible explanations include the formation of an epidermal-dermal split via a bullous lichen planus-like mechanism, or the coexistence of two diseases; i.e., acrokeratosis paraneoplastica plus either porphyria cutanea tarda, bullous pemphigoid, or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. One possible explanation for the development of the characteristic cutaneous eruption is an immune reaction, humoral or cellular, directed against a common antigen present on the tumor and the normal skin. Alternatively, tumor production of a keratinocyte growth factor such as TGF-alpha may be involved in the induction of the psoriasiform skin lesions. \nAttenuation of IL-2-induced multisystem organ edema by phalloidin and antamanide. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine with diverse effects, including the ability to stimulate lymphocyte differentiation into cells capable of lysing tumor. Its therapeutic efficacy is limited because of side effects such as breakdown of the microvascular barrier and edema. Control of the microvascular barrier is in part regulated by endothelial cell cytoskeletal contractile proteins. This study tests whether the cyclopeptides that maintain actin filament organization and distribution and reduce macromolecular flux across the endothelial cell junction in vitro would similarly maintain barrier tightness and prevent early edema produced by IL-2 in vivo. Anesthetized rats were treated at 30-min periods with intravenous saline (0.5 ml, n = 41), phalloidin (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), or antamanide, (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), starting 30 min before the 1-h infusion of 10(6) U of recombinant human IL-2 or saline. Six hours after the start of IL-2, there was edema in the saline/IL-2 group, as measured by increased wet-to-dry ratios (W/D) in the lungs, heart, and kidney. With saline/IL-2, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid contained an elevated protein concentration and higher plasma thromboxane levels compared with controls. The number of neutrophils sequestered in the lungs was more than twice that of saline controls. Phalloidin significantly attenuated edema in lung and reduced BAL protein leak. Antamanide treatment was as effective in limiting lung and heart edema, but, in contrast to phalloidin, antamanide prevented kidney edema and did not lead to an alteration in the liver W/D. Antamanide also prevented BAL fluid protein leak. \nTelangiectatic osteosarcoma. Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is a rare variant of osteosarcoma. In the original report from the authors' institution, a poor prognosis was noted. The authors have updated their experience with this entity. The prognosis for patients with telangiectatic osteosarcoma has improved remarkably. The prognosis in the present series seems to be the same as that for conventional osteosarcoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy seems to help in salvaging patients with metastatic disease. However, in this small series, survival of patients without metastasis is apparently not influenced by whether they received chemotherapy. \nAgonist-sensitive calcium stores in arteries from steroid hypertensive rats. The present study characterizes cellular calcium stores that are sensitive to norepinephrine and caffeine in arteries from deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertensive rats. Mesenteric arteries from normotensive and hypertensive rats were excised and cut into helical strips for isometric force recording. In calcium-free solution, phasic contractile responses to norepinephrine (5.9 x 10(-9) to 5.9 x 10(-6) M), but not caffeine (0.3-30 mM), were greater in hypertensive arteries. D-600, a calcium channel blocker, or removal of the endothelium did not alter phasic contractions to norepinephrine or caffeine. In contrast, contractions to both norepinephrine and caffeine were inhibited by ryanodine, a drug that depletes calcium from intracellular stores. An inhibitor of phospholipase C (2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate) attenuated contractions to norepinephrine but not those to caffeine. The augmented response to norepinephrine in hypertensive rats did not occur early after implantation of the mineralocorticoid, suggesting that this vascular change may not play a role in the development of high blood pressure in this experimental model. The augmented response to norepinephrine was reduced in mineralocorticoid-treated rats maintained on a low sodium diet, and these rats had blood pressures in the normotensive range. Because contractile responses to caffeine were not enhanced in arteries from hypertensive rats, we conclude that the cellular store for calcium is not enlarged compared with that in normotensive arteries. In contrast, the mobilization of calcium from cellular stores by norepinephrine is augmented in mineralocorticoid hypertension. This augmented response may be linked to altered phospholipase C activity and thus to an augmented action of inositol trisphosphate that releases calcium from intracellular sites. \nStage I and II subdiaphragmatic Hodgkin's disease. From January 1971 to December 1986, 521 patients with Hodgkin's disease were evaluated and treated at the Yale University School of Medicine or one of its close affiliates. A total of 258 patients had pathologic stage (PS) I or II disease, with 239 patients having Hodgkin's disease above the diaphragm (ADHD) and 19 patients having Hodgkin's disease below the diaphragm (BDHD). A comparison of patients with BDHD versus patients with ADHD showed that patients with BDHD were older (mean age, 42 versus 28 years of age, P = 0.005), were initially seen less often with nodular sclerosis subtype (32% versus 77%, P = 0.00001), and had a higher male: female ratio (2.8 versus 1.2, P = 0.12). Ten patients with BDHD (53%) had positive findings at staging laparotomy (0 of 4 clinical stage [CS] IA patients and 10 of 15 (67%) CS II patients). Radiation therapy alone was the initial treatment of choice for 74% of patients with BDHD versus 94% of the patients with ADHD. There was no statistical difference in the overall survival or relapse-free survival rates for patients with BDHD versus ADHD (10-year survival rates, BDHD = 73% and ADHD = 81%). However, patients with BDHD who initially had intra-abdominal disease had a statistically significant increase in death rate (60%) due to Hodgkin's disease compared with patients with BDHD who initially had only peripheral nodal disease (0%). Treatment recommendations for patients with BDHD should be tailored to the specific clinical presentation of each patient. For most PS IA/IIA patients initially seen with peripheral nodal disease, radiation therapy alone is a successful treatment program. However, combined modality therapy should be the treatment of choice for patients with BDHD initially seen with intra-abdominal disease. \nEchographic diagnosis of anterior hyaloidal fibrovascular proliferation. High-resolution contact B-scan echographic imaging of the ciliary body and peripheral retina was performed on five eyes with anterior hyaloidal fibrovascular proliferation and media opacity by means of a wide (58 degrees) scanning arc. This technique determined the circumferential and anteroposterior extent of peripheral traction retinal detachment associated with anterior hyaloidal fibrovascular proliferation, which correlated highly with findings at subsequent vitrectomy. Final visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in the two eyes (50%) with more limited peripheral traction detachment. In the presence of media opacity, anterior echographic imaging may allow early detection of traction retinal detachment associated with anterior hyaloidal fibrovascular proliferation and may be useful in characterizing the severity of this condition. \nPulse oximetry compared with Doppler ultrasound for assessment of collateral blood flow to the hand. Ischaemic injury to the hand after arterial cannulation is a rare but well documented complication and routine testing of the adequacy of collateral circulation is widely advocated. The widespread availability of the pulse oximeter in the operating theatre. its applicability in circumstances where the patient is unable to cooperate, and its dependence on pulsatile blood flow suggest that this device could potentially be usefully applied to the assessment of collateral blood flow. The reliability of the pulse oximeter to detect the presence or absence of collateral circulation was prospectively compared to Doppler ultrasound in 109 hands from 64 adult patients. Nine hands demonstrated inadequate ulnar collateral flow, one hand demonstrated inadequate radial collateral flow and a persistent median artery was found in one hand. In all patients the results of pulse oximeter testing (probe placed on the thumb correlated precisely with the results obtained with the Doppler device (probe located over the lateral aspect of the superficial palmar arch). These results demonstrate pulse oximetry to be a reliable method of assessing collateral blood flow to the hand before arterial cannulation. \nIonized calcium in blood: studies on patients with pulmonary disease. A new automatic ionized calcium analyser ICA 2 (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used for studies of ionized calcium (cCa2+) in the arterial blood of patients with a compensated respiratory acidosis due to chronic lung disease. The data for 16 patients showed an unexpectedly high level of variation in cCa2+ (range, 1.01-1.25 mmol l-1) despite the fact that there was only a small degree of variability in pH (range, 7.38-7.51). cCa2+ was not correlated with pH as has been observed in acute respiratory disturbances. A highly significant negative correlation was found between cCa2+ and base excess (BE) (r = -0.81, P less than 0.0001), and between cCa2+ and carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) (r = 0.71, P less than 0.002). These correlations differed from those reported previously in acute respiratory disturbances. CCa2+ showed a significant positive correlation with oxygen tension (PO2) (r = 0.71, P less than 0.002). It is concluded that cCa2+ in arterial blood from patients with chronic lung disease is correlated with acid-base and gas quantities in an entirely different manner to that observed in acute acid-base disturbances in normal adults. \nMacrophages, microglial cells, and HLA-DR antigens in fetal and infant brain. Immunohistochemical reactions for macrophages, microglia, and HLA-DR antigens were tested on frozen sections of necropsy brain tissue from 20 fetuses and infants ranging in age from 18 weeks' gestation to 8 months post term. No primary central nervous system disease was present but there were four cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Macrophages were detected in all the samples studied and were located in the germinal matrix zone, in perivascular spaces throughout the brain, and in the leptomeninges and subependymal layer. Well differentiated microglia were present in all cases examined after 35 weeks' gestation and less well ramified forms were seen at earlier stages of gestation. HLA-DR antigens were detected on a small number of macrophages, chiefly in a perivascular location, in all but three cases. The fewest reactive cells and the weakest reactions occurred in the youngest fetuses. One case of SIDS showed increased foci of microglia in perivascular white matter: this case and one other case of SIDS were the only cases with well ramified microglia that expressed HLA-DR antigens. These findings may be relevant to an understanding of local immune responses in fetal brain infections, including human immunodeficiency virus infection. \nImmediate mandibular replacement using reconstruction plates. Mandibular reconstruction at the time of tumor resection remains a surgical dilemma. Primary reconstruction allows for immediate reconstitution of mandibular form and function. Various methods have been attempted, but none enjoys uniform success. With advances in the field of microvascular surgery have come numerous options in replacing these defects. These procedures, however, require special surgical teams and are associated with an increase in operative time as well as morbidity at the donor site. An alternative method involves the use of mandibular reconstruction plates to bridge the defect between segments. This review focuses on 19 patients whose jaws were reconstructed in this fashion. Although not free of complications, mandibular plate reconstruction offers the advantages of (1) lack of donor site morbidity, (2) expediency, (3) excellent mandibular contour, and (4) the ability to reconstruct the condyle when necessary. The technique, results, and complications associated with this procedure are discussed. \nModified approach for ethmoid and anterior skull base surgery. The use of combined craniofacial resection is well established for tumors of the ethmoid bone and the anterior aspect of the base of the skull. Mobilization of the medial fronto-orbital ridge improves the transbasal approach and can be performed with a monobloc bone flap. We describe an en bloc bifrontal craniotomy including the supraorbital ridges and the nasal bones. This provides a wider angle of approach to the anterior aspect of the base of the skull than any other method and avoids retraction of the frontal lobes. This type of bone flap procedure can be performed after a wide periosteal dissection in the coronal area of the scalp alone, without facial skin incision. \nEffects of a twenty-four-hour milrinone infusion in patients with severe heart failure and cardiogenic shock as a function of the hemodynamic initial condition. The systemic and pulmonary arterial hemodynamics of 40 patients with severe congestive heart failure were determined during a 24-hour infusion of milrinone (0.5 micrograms/kg/min) after a loading dose of 50 micrograms/kg. A subgroup (n = 18) with severe cardiac pump dysfunction and three patients in cardiogenic shock were analyzed separately; their hemodynamic response was compared with that of the total group (n = 40). After 15 minutes of intravenous therapy with milrinone, the total group (n = 40) showed an increase of 65% in cardiac index; in the subgroup (n = 18) cardiac index increased by 94% after 15 minutes and by 106% after 30 minutes. Likewise, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased after 30 minutes in both the total group (n = 40) and the subgroup (n = 18). The heart rate showed an overall tendency to decrease. The systolic blood pressure tended upward and remained statistically unchanged in the total group, whereas in the subgroup in which pressure was initially low, there was an increase in the systolic pressure after 1 hour and a further increase after 24 hours. Mean arterial pressure also rose in this subgroup. The early improvement in all measured hemodynamic parameters was sustained throughout the 24-hour infusion period. Development of tolerance was not observed, nor were any clinically symptomatic side effects or symptomatic arrhythmias. Thus intravenous milrinone is a safe medication for the rapid and prolonged improvement in hemodynamics, specifically in patients with severely restricted cardiac pumping function. \nAntihypertensive therapy: taking lipids into consideration. Several antihypertensive agents have been found to influence serum lipid profiles. Thiazide diuretics increase total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and slightly reduce high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Most beta-blockers substantially increase triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, alpha- and beta-blockers, and beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are lipid neutral. alpha 1-Antagonists (e.g., terazosin and prazosin) lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and improve total cholesterol/HDL ratios. Observational epidemiologic studies indicate that the lipid effects of antihypertensive agents are large enough to account for substantial differences in the predicted incidence of coronary heart disease. Combination therapy with the alpha 1-antagonist terazosin plus either thiazides or beta-blockers also ameliorates the adverse lipid effects of these agents used alone. A reasonable approach to managing the lipid problems often associated with hypertension is to advise a cholesterol-lowering, low-sodium diet and weight reduction and to select drugs that alone or in combination do not adversely affect lipid profiles. \nPhasic sleep components in infants with cyanosis during feeding. Although brainstem immaturity has been postulated as one of the pathogenesis underlying cyanosis during feeding (CDF), there has been no widely accepted physiologic parameter that reflects brainstem function. We recently proposed that the dissociation index (DI), one of the phasic sleep parameters, is a reliable and quantitative sleep parameter for assessing brainstem maturation during early infancy. In the present study, we evaluated brainstem impairment in infants with CDF using phasic sleep components. Polysomnographies were obtained for 12 infants with CDF who were equally divided into 2 groups: one had or subsequently experienced apparent life-threatening events or sudden infant death syndrome (ALTE-SIDS group) and the other did not (CDF group). Rapid eye movement density and the number of gross movements (body movements, including the trunk, lasting greater than or equal to 2 sec) in the patients were identical to those in the controls. In the CDF group, the decrease of the average DI value from the controls was significantly less than the decrease in the ALTE-SIDS group. CDF may be a mild expression of brainstem immaturity. DI appears to be useful when evaluating infants with cyanosis during feeding. \nThe intranasal ethmoidectomy: an experience with 1,077 procedures. A series of 1,077 intranasal ethmoidectomies (825 with sphenoid sinusotomies) was performed in 600 patients over a 15-year period at The Mount Sinai Medical Center. The technique is a modification of the classical operation originally proposed by Yankauer. The rate of significant complications was 1.1%. A subset of 90 patients underwent 166 procedures and were followed an average of 3.5 years. The patients were analyzed according to whether the disease was focal or diffuse, infectious or polypoid, and whether asthma was present. The surgical success rate was 88% in nonasthmatics, but dropped to 50% in asthmatic patients despite total sphenoethmoidectomy. This underscores the importance of this condition as a biological modifier of surgical prognosis. Accordingly, a system of classification of sinus diseases is proposed based upon disease extent and type and whether asthma is present. \nChronic diuretic therapy with moderate doses of triamterene is not associated with folate deficiency. The diuretic drug triamterene has previously been shown to be a competitive inhibitor of folate absorption in the rat intestine (J Lab Clin Med 1986;108:272-6). We therefore investigated whether human subjects who are taking the drug on a long-term basis are at increased risk of folate deficiency. In each of two free-living populations, a study was performed to compare the folate status of triamterene users with those not taking the drug. The first population consisted of 272 elderly individuals not living in institutions who were participants in a nutrition status survey and who were taking a variety of antihypertensive medications; 32 of these individuals were daily users of triamterene. The hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell (RBC) count, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values were not significantly different between the triamterene users and nonusers. The female triamterene users had a slightly higher serum folate level than the female nonusers (p less than 0.04); a similar pattern was observed among the men, although the difference was not statistically significant. The second population consisted of 27 individuals attending a hypertension clinic; 18 subjects were taking 50 to 150 mg of triamterene per day and nine were taking antihypertensive drugs other than triamterene. The hemoglobin concentration, RBC count, MCV, serum folate values, and RBC folate values were found to not differ significantly between the triamterene users and the hypertensive controls (p greater than 0.05). These data suggest that chronic triamterene administration in individuals not living in institutions, at the doses examined in this study, is not associated with indications of folate deficiency. \nPulmonary haemosiderosis associated with left atrial myxoma. A patient with features suggesting pulmonary haemosiderosis was found to have a myxoma. The pulmonary lesion cleared after excision of the tumour. \nFluorescence localization of early colonic cancer in the rat by hematoporphyrin derivative. Laser excitation of hematoporphyrin derivatives (HPD) localizing in tumors of the tracheobronchial tree and bladder is useful in the identification and treatment of those tumors. A comparable utility for HPD in the endoscopic localization of colonic tumors may be possible. In this study the ability of HPD to identify 1,2 dimethylhydrazine (DMH) induced colon cancer in rats is evaluated. A total of 111 rats were studied with HPD. Sixty-nine rats received weekly injections of DMH (20 mg/kg) and 42 received injections of the vehicle alone. Twenty-four hours after the intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg of HPD, 18 DMH-induced tumors were identified by visual fluorescence using excitation by either a blue light (390-436 nm) or an argon laser (488 and 514 nm). This represented 100% of the visually or microscopically detected tumors. Seventy-five fluorescent areas were noted that did not contain evidence of cancer. The majority (63) of false positive areas contained lymphoid follicles. All but 2 false positive areas (73/75, 97%, p less than .001) were seen in DMH-treated animals, suggesting that they were an artifact of DMH treatment. HPD fluorescence did not identify microscopic dysplasia. We conclude that HPD fluorescence is an effective method of identifying early colonic cancer and may have a potential clinical role in patients at high risk for colorectal cancer. \nAcute lower limb ischemia: failure of anticoagulant treatment to improve one-month results of arterial thromboembolectomy. A prospective randomized multi-center study. The value of short-term anticoagulant treatment in improving the early outcome in patients operated on for acute lower-limb ischemia has been debated and so far unproven. In this prospective randomized multi-center study, 188 such patients were randomized on admission, either to preoperative and postoperative anticoagulant medication (AC group, n = 94) or no anticoagulant treatment during the first month after surgery (O group, n = 94). Background factors were evenly distributed in the two groups, and 89% of the cases were considered as embolic. Analysis on an intention-to-treat basis showed no differences in outcome after 30 days. Good results, survivors who had amputation, and patients who died in the two groups are given respectively: AC group, 61%, 9%, 30%; O group, 65%, 11%, 24%. The results were similar in the two treatment groups also if only patients with a cardiac source of embolism were analyzed. Local bleeding complications were more common in the AC group (17% vs 2%, p less than 0.01). It is concluded that preoperative and early postoperative anticoagulant medication should not be routinely administered since such treatment is unlikely to improve the short-term results of lower-limb arterial thromboembolectomy while bleeding complications increase. The possible value of late (beyond 1 month) long-term anticoagulant treatment remains to be studied. \nIntraperitoneal contrast material improves the CT detection of peritoneal metastases. The preoperative detection of peritoneal metastases from gynecologic malignancies is difficult; in particular, CT often fails to detect peritoneal implants. This study was designed to determine if the administration of intraperitoneal iodinated contrast media would increase the CT detection of such peritoneal metastases. Prospectively, both standard and intraperitoneal contrast-enhanced CT studies of the abdomen and pelvis were performed in 16 patients with suspected gynecologic tumors. All patients then underwent operative staging, with the location and number of metastases documented. The intraperitoneal enhanced CT studies were more sensitive in the detection of peritoneal metastases than standard CT examinations. Whereas routine CT detected peritoneal metastases in seven (64%) of 11 patients with surgically proved implants, the intraperitoneal enhanced CT studies detected peritoneal metastases in all 11 patients. Depending on the specific intraperitoneal compartments involved, the sensitivity of intraperitoneal enhanced CT in the detection of peritoneal metastases was two- to fourfold greater than that of standard CT examinations. Our results suggest that intraperitoneal enhanced CT is superior to standard CT in the detection of peritoneal metastases. \nHigher recurrence rate after coronary angioplasty in unstable angina pectoris. PURPOSE: Recurrent stenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is a significant problem, requiring repeat dilation in about one-third of all treated patients. Various clinical and procedure-related predictors have been proposed. Between 1983 and 1987, 257 patients underwent 322 procedures, where 380 stenoses were attempted. Indications were: stable angina pectoris 73%, unstable angina pectoris 22%, other indication 5%. The primary success rate was defined as a less than 50% remaining postprocedure stenosis. FINDINGS: Repeat angiograms were done for 88% of the initially successful cases, either six months after PTCA or if there was a clinical recurrence. Restenosis was defined as a recurrence of a more than 50% diameter stenosis. The restenosis rate was 33% and was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) for unstable (46%) than for stable angina pectoris (29%). There was a nonsignificant tendency to a higher restenosis rate in the left anterior descending artery than in the other coronary vessels. IMPLICATIONS: The increased restenosis rate seen after PTCA for unstable angina pectoris could be caused by a higher activity in systems affecting the proliferative processes in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall, which is thought to form the pathophysiologic basis for restenosis after PTCA. \nNutritional assessment of patients with extended left ventricular assist device support. The nutritional status of nine patients with end-stage heart disease who were supported by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for more than 30 days while awaiting cardiac transplantation was evaluated. Nutritional status was indicated by the following scale: 0-2, adequate nourishment; 3-5, moderate malnourishment; greater than 5, severe malnourishment. This scale was based on serial assessments of albumin, transferrin, total lymphocyte count, percentage of ideal body weight, midarm circumference, triceps skinfold, and arm muscle circumference. Each variable was compared with established standards before implantation and before transplantation times and assessed 1 point if less than the normal value and 0 points if within the normal range. At the time of LVAD implantation, 5 patients had a score of 0-2, 3 patients had a score of 3-5, and 1 patient had a score greater than 5. At the time of cardiac transplantation, 7 patients had a score of 0-2, 2 patients had a score of 3-5, and no patients had a score greater than 5. The patients who were able to meet at least 50% of their daily caloric and protein requirements by oral intake alone were noted. At LVAD implantation, only 2 patients (22%) met this requirement; however, 6 patients (67%) met this requirement at the time of cardiac transplantation. All 9 patients underwent cardiac transplantation, and 8 survived. Thus, it appears that extended LVAD support and maintenance of hemodynamic stability allow patients to regain the desire and ability to achieve adequate nutritional status, which may considerably reduce their perioperative transplant risks. \nCongenital arteriovenous communications and the development of two types of leaking retinal macroaneurysms. We treated a patient with a rare combination of congenital arteriovenous communications and the development of leaking macroaneurysms of different types. Initially, leaking macroaneurysms developed in the shunt area of the arteriovenous communication; later, a preexistent fusiform macroaneurysm in the afferent arteriole of the congenital communication started leaking. Because exudates and fluid from the leaking macroaneurysms reached the fovea, laser treatment was performed to obliterate the macroaneurysms. We assume that after obliteration of the macroaneurysms with laser in the shunt area, the increase of hydrostatic pressure on the thin wall of the fusiform aneurysm of the afferent artery led to its leaking. We saw no signs of vascular occlusion after laser treatment. \nPost-traumatic syringomyelia following uncomplicated spinal fracture. Two cases of post-traumatic syringomyelia presenting 10 and 41 years after spinal injuries that had caused lumbar vertebral fractures but no lasting neurological deficits are reported. In both patients the caudal end of the syrinx cavities, as shown by MRI, corresponded to the level of the previous vertebral fractures. Patients presenting with post-traumatic syringomyelia after uncomplicated spinal fracture are very rare, and the significance of the past history of spinal trauma may be overlooked. \nStimulation of healing of chronic wounds by epidermal growth factor. We evaluated the effect of topical epidermal growth factor treatment on healing of chronic wounds in a prospective, open-label, crossover trial. Five males and four females who ranged in age from 40 to 72 years (average 57 +/- 9 years) were enrolled. Four patients had adult-onset diabetes mellitus, two had rheumatoid arthritis, two had old burn scars, and one had a failed abdominal incision. The average duration of the ulcers prior to treatment with epidermal growth factor was 12 +/- 5 months (range 1 to 48 months). Following failure of the wounds to heal with conventional therapies, including debridement, skin graphs, and vascular reconstruction, wounds were treated twice daily with Silvadene alone for periods ranging from 3 weeks to 6 months. No evidence of healing was observed in any of the patients' wounds during Silvadene treatment, and patients were crossed over to twice a day treatment with Silvadene containing 10 micrograms epidermal growth factor per gram. Wounds of eight patients healed completely with epidermal growth factor-Silvadene treatment in an average of 34 +/- 26 days (mean +/- SD, range 12 to 92 days) and did not reoccur for periods ranging from 1 to 4 years. One patient failed therapy. These results suggest that topical treatment of chronic wounds with epidermal growth factor may stimulate healing. \nCognitive outcome following tricyclic and electroconvulsive treatment of major depression in the elderly. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to ascertain the affective and cognitive outcome after tricyclic and electroconvulsive treatment of elderly medical-psychiatric patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression, some of whom had normal cognitive functioning and some of whom were cognitively impaired before treatment. METHOD: Patients who met criteria for major depression on the basis of a structured diagnostic interview and who scored 17 or more on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were evaluated with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. The patients were then treated in a nonrandom manner with either tricyclic antidepressants or ECT (followed by tricyclic maintenance therapy). The majority of the patients treated with ECT had not responded previously to tricyclics. Follow-up psychometric testing was repeated in 6 months. RESULTS: Among the patients with normal pretreatment cognitive functioning, cognition was generally stable. Among the patients with pretreatment cognitive impairment, a substantial number--including those receiving ECT--demonstrated improvement in cognition. While the majority of patients improved with respect to both their affective and cognitive states, certain treatment-refractory subgroups were nevertheless identified. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that cognitive dysfunction associated with depression may improve after treatment in a substantial number of elderly patients, including those receiving ECT. Relapse rates, however, may be relatively high, and residual symptoms may persist, which emphasizes the need for optimal initial and long-term antidepressant strategies for this population. \nEffect of propofol on the incidence of postoperative vomiting after strabismus surgery in pediatric outpatients. Vomiting is a common problem after strabismus surgery in pediatric outpatients. We compared the effects of propofol with and without N2O and droperidol to the effects of a conventional regimen consisting of halothane-N2O-droperidol on the recovery characteristics and the incidence of postoperative emesis after strabismus surgery in 120 ASA physical status 1 or 2 children. After induction of anesthesia with halothane-N2O, patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Group A (control) received halothane, 66% N2O, and droperidol 75 micrograms.kg-1; group B, propofol 2 mg.kg-1 bolus followed by infusion of 160 microgram.kg-1.min-1; group C, propofol (as in group B) and 66% N2O; and group D, propofol (as in group B), 66% N2O (as in group C), and droperidol 75 micrograms.kg-1. Patients in group B had more episodes of intraoperative oculocardiac reflex responses than patients in group A, but had shorter times to extubation, oral intake, ambulation, and discharge, as well as a lower incidence of postoperative emesis (P less than 0.05). The addition of N2O to the propofol anesthetic regimen (group C) was associated with an increased incidence of emesis (P less than 0.05), whereas the addition of droperidol to the propofol-N2O regimen (group D) did not affect the incidence of emesis compared to the other three groups. We conclude that maintenance of anesthesia with a total intravenous regimen using propofol results in a more rapid recovery and less postoperative emesis than with a halothane-N2O-droperidol regimen. \nDonor scleral graft patching for persistent filtration bleb leak. We report effective and efficient sealing of a persistent leak in a cystic filtration bleb by applying a full-thickness donor scleral patch. \nZollinger-Ellison syndrome. A new look at regression of gastrinomas. Of 44 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated at our institution, nine appeared to have undergone \"regression\" of their gastrinomas. Six of the nine patients had sporadic gastrinomas and became permanently eugastrinemic following excision of nodal metastases and total gastrectomy (n = 4), antrectomy (n = 1), or pancreatoduodenectomy (n = 1) (mean survival, 13 years). The other three patients had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome as part of the multiple endocrine adenopathy type 1 syndrome and became temporarily eugastrinemic after total gastrectomy (mean survival, 11 years). Occult submucosal duodenal-wall microgastrinomas (mean size, 3.0 mm) were found to have been serendipitously excised in four patients. Long-term follow-up of these nine patients, as well as of six other patients described in the literature, demonstrates that excision of occult duodenal-wall gastrinomas provides a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of apparent regression of primary gastrinomas and the eugastrinemia that may follow total gastrectomy. \nHormonal and metabolic response to operative stress in the neonate. It is evident from this review that newborns, even those born prematurely, are capable of mounting an endocrine and metabolic response to operative stress. Unfortunately, many of the areas for which a relatively well-characterized response exists in adults are poorly documented in neonates. As is the case in adults, the response seems to be primarily catabolic in nature because the combined hormonal changes include an increased release of catabolic hormones such as catecholamines, glucagon, and corticosteroids coupled with a suppression of and peripheral resistance to the effects of the primary anabolic hormone, insulin. \nContinuation of normal neurobehavioural development in fetuses with absent umbilical arterial end diastolic velocities. Detailed serial observations of behaviour were made in four singleton fetuses who were very small for dates and who had persistently absent umbilical artery end diastolic velocities for 2 to 9 weeks duration. All were born preterm for deteriorating maternal disease, and in two there were additional fetal indications for delivery. Behavioural comparison with 45 low risk singleton fetuses, at comparable gestations, revealed no significant differences in the development of behavioural cycles, the proportion of time spent in quiet cycles, or the amount of fetal breathing. None of the fetuses developed an abnormal heart rate pattern. We conclude that prenatal neurobehavioural development may continue apparently unimpaired in the presence of absent umbilical artery end-diastolic velocity of several weeks duration. Long term data of infant outcome are necessary before the clinical significance of this can be assessed. \nNontraumatic abdominal aortic thrombosis presenting with anterior spinal artery syndrome and pulmonary edema. A 51-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer developed pulmonary edema and lower extremity paraplegia with preservation of proprioception as the initial manifestation of abdominal aortic thrombosis. Back pain was present in the lumbar region radiating to buttocks and legs in a bilateral radicular pattern. Femoral pulses were initially palpable. Aortic angiography revealed complete abdominal aortic occlusion at L3 as well as total occlusion of the bilateral superficial femoral arteries and bilateral common iliac arteries. Transient occlusion of the anterior spinal artery due to aortic thrombosis may cause paraplegia and may also progress to renal failure, bowel infarction, and limb loss if left untreated. Abdominal aortic thrombosis needs to be considered in a patient who presents with an anterior spinal artery syndrome, which, if present, must be treated as rapidly as possible to preserve motor and sensory function. \nNeuro-ophthalmologic signs of AIDS: 50 patients. In 50 hospitalized patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, signs of central eye movement limitation (28 cases) were most common. Peripheral eye movement limitations (18), abnormalities of vision (18), and abnormal spontaneous eye movements (15) occurred with about equal frequency. Meningitis (17), usually due to lymphoma (8) or Cryptococcus (8), was the usual cause of peripheral nervous system involvement, while toxoplasmosis (18) was more common than lymphoma (4) or presumed viral causes (8) in producing CNS dysfunction. The midbrain and pretectal (8) were affected about as often as the pontine tegmentum (9), but rostral brainstem lesions appeared to be the result of toxoplasmosis (4) or lymphoma (3), whereas a viral etiology was the presumed cause of most caudal stem involvement. \nMedullary catecholaminergic neurons in the normal human brain and in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is thought to cause degeneration of melanin-pigmented catecholaminergic neurons throughout the brainstem, but little quantitative information is available on the fate of catecholaminergic neurons associated with the dorsal vagal complex or medullary reticular formation. We therefore examined these neurons in the normal human medulla and in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, using both a melanin stain and immunohistochemical methods with an antiserum against tyrosine hydroxylase. The greatest numbers of catecholaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral reticular formation (A1/C1 group) were located in the far rostral medulla, whereas the largest populations of catecholaminergic cells in the dorsal vagal complex (A2/C2 group) were found at the level of the area postrema. No loss of cells was observed in the A1/C1 group in the parkinsonian brains. In contrast, the A2/C2 group showed moderate loss of neurons, most marked at the level of the area postrema. This difference was entirely due to the loss of neurons in the medial component of the A2 group, a population that normally is only lightly pigmented, while the heavily pigmented neurons in the ventral and intermediate components of the A2 complex were unaffected. Parkinson's disease causes degeneration only of selected populations of medullary catecholaminergic neurons, without apparent relationship to the extent of melanin pigmentation. \nEfficacy of ivermectin for control of microfilaremia recurring after treatment with diethylcarbamazine. I. Clinical and parasitologic observations. We compared the efficacy of a single dose of ivermectin with that of a standard course of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) for the control of microfilaremia in 60 patients with bancroftian filariasis who had developed recurrent microfilaremia after each of three or more prior treatments with DEC. The study was done as a randomized, double-blind trial. Complete, but in some cases, transient clearance of microfilaremia was observed in both treatment groups. At one year, recurrent microfilaremia was present in seven patients treated with ivermectin and in five treated with DEC. Pretreatment levels of microfilaremia were significantly higher in patients who relapsed within one year after treatment than in those who remained amicrofilaremic. Side effects with both treatments were common, but mild. Febrile reactions were more frequent in the ivermectin group; localized reactions consistent with a flare-up of acute filarial disease occurred mostly in the DEC group. We conclude that ivermectin is an effective and practical alternative to DEC for treatment of recurrent microfilaremia due to bancroftian filariasis. \nCholecystectomy is safer without drainage: the results of a prospective, randomized clinical trial. Drainage after cholecystectomy remains routine despite the lack of scientific supportive data. Numerous clinical studies in the past have attempted to address this controversy but have failed to resolve the issue for different reasons. These include retrospective design, inclusion of only selected cases, and randomization before surgery. In this study 479 patients undergoing cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to a drainage group (a high-pressure suction drain in Morison's pouch for 48 hours) or a nondrainage group. Randomization was performed at the time of peritoneal closure. All patients undergoing cholecystectomy, both elective and urgent, were included and the operations were performed by all grades of surgeons. There were two deaths from cardiopulmonary causes, both in the drainage group. No patient required reoperation in either group. The incidence of both wound infections (15 vs 5; p less than 0.05) and chest infections (56 vs 19, p less than 0.02) was significantly higher in the drainage group. Three hundred fifty-six patients underwent abdominal ultrasonography 72 hours after surgery. The number of subhepatic fluid collections thus detected was significantly higher in the patients who received a drain (17 vs 6, p less than 0.05). None of these collections was clinically significant. The postoperative hospital stay was longer in the patients with drains (10.3 vs 9.1 days), but this difference failed to reach statistical significance. We conclude from this study that the use of a drain after cholecystectomy serves no useful purpose and is potentially harmful. This practice should be abandoned. \nIndividualization and enamel histology: a case report in forensic anthropology. The cranium of a native Indian child about six years old was found in 1979 near Taseko River, British Columbia, Canada. While the remains matched the report of a child missing for eight years in terms of race, age at death, locale, and elapsed time since death, the cranium and dentition were basically unidentifiable because of the claimed lack of medical or dental history. There was no dental work, and the parents were unknown or dead. We report the presence, in the dental enamel of the primary and secondary dentition, of stress markers, termed striae of Retzius, whose locations correspond well with anecdotal reports and recently discovered medical records which describe the timing of specific episodes of stress. The enhanced probability of personal identification from dental histological stress markers is evaluated. \nIdiopathic orthostatic hypotension, midodrine, and anaesthesia. A patient with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension receiving chronic oral midodrine therapy required anaesthesia for coronary artery bypass grafting. A perioperative infusion of phenylephrine was substituted for midodrine, an alpha-2 agonist, enabling hypotension resulting from low systemic vascular resistance to be controlled easily. Anticipated adrenergic receptor denervation hypersensitivity was noted. The only significant perioperative problem was one episode of syncope from orthostatic hypotension during the reambulation period. \nHemidystonia due to a contralateral parieto-occipital metastasis: disappearance after removal of the mass lesion. A patient presented with left-sided hemidystonia. CT revealed a contralateral parieto-occipital mass lesion compressing the basal ganglia, which were spared by the mass. After microsurgical resection of the tumor, which was verified histologically as a metastasis of a large-cell anaplastic carcinoma, the movement disorder dissolved completely. \nPostsepsis bradycardia in children with leukemia. OBJECTIVE: We observed sinus bradycardia in a small number of children with hematologic malignancies who were recovering from sepsis. Our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A pediatric ICU in a children's oncology hospital. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the ICU over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. Six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. All patients had positive blood cultures (Streptococcus mitis, n = 4; Escherichia coli, n = 2; and Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). All seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. Neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. No therapy was given for the bradycardia. Echocardiograms and ECGs were normal in all patients, except for the presence of bradycardia. Bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. After that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. Prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. As the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated. \nShock wave-induced pancreatic trauma. A case is described of the appearance of a pancreatic or peripancreatic lesion after left renal calculus fragmentation by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Its anatomical location and subsequent disappearance suggest it was related to trauma caused by the shock waves. The brief literature on pancreatic injury after ESWL is reviewed, and the role of the patient's underlying liver disease in the genesis of this complication is discussed. \nThe protective efficacy of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in newborn infants of hepatitis B e antigen-positive-hepatitis B surface antigen carrier mothers. Recombinant hepatitis B vaccine has been shown to be as safe and effective as plasma-derived vaccines. However, its efficacy in the prevention of perinatal infection has not been fully evaluated in an endemic area. We recruited 110 high risk infants born to hepatitis B e antigen-positive-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier mothers in a study of recombinant vaccine efficacy. They were randomized into 2 groups, A (54 infants) and B (56 infants), to receive 4 doses of vaccine, containing 20 or 10 micrograms of surface antigen, respectively, at 0, 1, 2 and 12 months of age. An additional 60 high risk infants were recruited later (Group C) and received three 20-micrograms doses of vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months of age. All infants also received a dose (145 IU) of hepatitis B immunoglobulin soon after birth. Sera were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 14 months of age to assay HBsAg and anti-HBs. At 12 months of age the HBsAg carrier rates were 7.4 and 1.8%, in Groups A and B, respectively. In Group C the HBsAg-positive rate was 3.3%. HBsAg was invariably first observed between 0 and 2 months of age. Virtually all noncarrier infants developed substantial titers of anti-HBs at 12 months of age. No serious adverse effect was observed after vaccination. \nMultiple basal cell carcinomas and HLA frequencies in southern Australia. An association between HLA-DR1 and the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas was detected in southern Australia. A reduction in HLA-DR4 was found in patients with basal cell carcinoma compared with a local control group. The relative risk for HLA-DR1 was 2.1, which was lower than that for persons in farther countries from the equator. \nSuccessful operation on a coronary arteriovenous fistula in a 74 year old woman. Coronary arteriovenous fistulas are rare and are usually diagnosed in children or young adults. Most are believed to be congenital. A right coronary arteriovenous fistula was first diagnosed in a patient of 74. Despite her age the fistula was successfully operated on and her symptoms were relieved. \nAntitumor activities of interferon alpha, beta, and gamma and their combinations on human melanoma cells in vitro: changes of proliferation, melanin synthesis, and immunophenotype. The antitumor activities of human interferon (IFN) alpha, beta, and gamma alone or in combination were studied on four human melanoma cell lines (StML-11, StML-12, StML-14, and SKMel-28) in various concentrations (1-50,000 IU/ml IFN alpha, 0.1-1000 IU/ml IFN beta, 1-10,000 IU/ml IFN gamma) in vitro. In all experiments IFN beta exhibited the most potent antiproliferative effect of all IFN tested. After 3 d of incubation a 50% growth inhibition was achieved with 20-40 IU/ml for natural IFN beta and with 600-1200 U/ml for recombinant IFN gamma. Substantially higher doses (7,000 to more than 50,000 IU/ml) of recombinant IFN alpha 2a were required to achieve a 50% growth inhibition. A strong synergistic antiproliferative activity resulted from the combination of IFN alpha with IFN gamma and IFN beta with IFN gamma. None of the IFN tested induced terminal differentiation of melanoma cells in vitro. The formation of dendrites was inhibited, and the portion of differentiated cells in vitro was reduced after treatment with IFN in comparison to the untreated controls (untreated controls: 100%; portion of differentiated cells after treatment with IFN alpha: 58%-74%, IFN beta: 48%-96%, IFN gamma: 10%-33%). The melanin synthesis was slightly elevated after treatment with IFN alpha (untreated controls: 100%; after treatment with IFN alpha: 103%-157%, ns.) and decreased significantly after treatment with IFN beta (49%-71%, p less than 0.05) as well as with IFN gamma (80%-88%, ns.). Cell surface markers were modulated varyingly by the IFN: HLA-I antigens were enhanced by all IFN, with IFN beta emerging as the most potent inducer. Only IFN gamma, however, induced a de novo expression of HLA-DR and -DQ antigens and increased the expression of the ICAM-1 molecule and of the melanoma progression marker A.1.43. Possibly, these findings indicate a biologically more aggressive phenotype of melanoma cells. \nCor triatriatum with isolated pulmonary venous stenosis in an adult: diagnosis with transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. The diagnosis of cor triatriatum in an adult was made from routine two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography. The findings of aliasing and turbulence in the roof of the left atrium suggested pulmonary venous stenosis. A transesophageal echocardiogram defined both the hemodynamic features of nonobstructing cor triatriatum and the presence of isolated pulmonary venous stenosis. The clinical use of transesophageal echocardiography with color flow Doppler in the elucidation of complex anatomic substrate is demonstrated. \nMastoid surgery in childhood. The presenting features and operative findings in 105 patients aged 16 years or less undergoing mastoid surgery are reviewed. In 94% surgery was for chronic otomastoiditis, usually acquired, and associated with cholesteatoma in 64%. Post-operative otorrhoea persisted beyond 6 months in 44% and contralateral disease required some form of surgical procedure in 20%. Post-operative hearing thresholds were improved or unchanged in the majority of patients, most of whom underwent cortical or modified radical mastoidectomy. An improvement in the therapeutic results of mastoid surgery in childhood is clearly necessary, but requires a greater understanding of the aetiology of chronic middle ear disease. \nDoppler echocardiography for rejection surveillance in the cardiac allograft recipient. Echocardiography is noninvasive, allows real-time visualization of the heart, and can be performed serially without harmful biologic effects. It is also relatively inexpensive compared with other diagnostic modalities used for cardiac transplant rejection surveillance, such as cardiac biopsy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. It is free of the potential complications associated with cardiac biopsy, such as accidental disruption of cardiac valves or chordae tendineae, ventricular septal perforation, introduction of bacteria, and the difficulty of obtaining adequate sampling for effective diagnosis as a result of formation of scar tissue. Unlike biopsy, echocardiography does not cause the patient anxiety and discomfort or use many physician and instrument or laboratory resources. Because the results of echocardiography are available within minutes compared with the hours usually needed for biopsy results, it allows prompt decisions regarding patient clinical care and treatment. In our work to date, echocardiography has not replaced the cardiac biopsy in surveillance of rejection in the cardiac transplant patient, but rather has become a useful adjunct to it. When echocardiographic findings indicate changes characteristic of rejection, biopsies are performed earlier, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, when echocardiographic findings are stable and negative for rejection, the number of routine cardiac biopsies performed can be reduced. This article discusses the use of echocardiography in surveillance of the cardiac transplant patient and the ability of echocardiography to augment the biopsy and clinical regimens in assessing cardiac allograft rejection. \nAbnormal automatic rhythms in ischemic Purkinje fibers are modulated by a specific alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype. BACKGROUND. Recent advances in adrenergic pharmacology have made possible the identification of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes using the specific blockers chloroethylclonidine and WB 4101. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, we used these two blockers to determine the mechanisms responsible for automatic rhythms occurring during simulated ischemia and reperfusion of isolated canine Purkinje fibers. Experiments were done in the presence of propranolol to minimize beta-adrenergic contributions to the rhythms studied. In the control situation, all fibers showed membrane potentials greater than -90 mV and normal automatic rhythms. During simulated ischemia, membrane potential depolarized to the -60 mV range. Abnormal automaticity was seen in 20% of fibers not treated with phenylephrine and in 50% of those superfused with 1 x 10(-7) M phenylephrine. The incidence of abnormal automaticity was reduced to 0% by WB 4101 (which blocks phosphoinositide metabolic effects of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the heart) and was increased to 90% by chloroethylclonidine (which blocks Na-K pump-stimulating effects of alpha-agonists). Moreover, the ischemic fibers were significantly more hyperpolarized during superfusion with WB 4101 than with chloroethylclonidine. Triggered activity induced by delayed or early after depolarizations was not seen in any experiment. CONCLUSIONS. Automatic arrhythmias induced by alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation during simulated ischemia may be attributed to a specific alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype that is blocked by WB 4101. These results have important implications with respect to the induction of arrhythmias in the setting of ischemia and the means for their prevention or treatment. \nSecondary myelodysplastic syndrome complicating therapy for osteogenic sarcoma. A 12-year-old girl with nonmetastatic osteogenic sarcoma received treatment with doxorubicin, methotrexate, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, and dactinomycin. She developed unexplained persistent pancytopenia after completion of chemotherapy. Twenty-three months after the initial diagnosis of osteosarcoma an evaluation revealed a bone marrow pattern consistent with the diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts, and karyotype analysis showed characteristic findings of therapy-related myelodysplasia (loss of chromosomes 5 and 7, as well as 12p and 17p deletions). Bone marrow transplantation from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible sibling donor was performed 26 months after the diagnosis of the primary malignancy. Although it is unproven that the alkylating agents administered to this patient were responsible for the myelodysplastic syndrome, careful follow-up of osteosarcoma patients who receive alkylating agents is warranted. \nGastrointestinal complications in 4473 patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Thirty-nine gastrointestinal complications occurred in 35 of 4473 patients (0.78 per cent) who underwent surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass during an 8-year period. The mortality rate when one of these complications occurred was 22 (63 per cent) representing 11.5 per cent of the 191 deaths from all causes in the series. The relative risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication was 1:249 when the heart was not opened, 1:66 when it was and 1:5 after cardiac transplantation. Gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 20) was the most common complication of whom nine (45 per cent) died, followed by intestinal infarction (n = 12) with eight (67 per cent) deaths and acute pancreatitis (n = 6) all of whom died. There was one death after surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 7). No patient survived bowel infarction without operation but resection was possible in five of the eight who underwent surgery, four of whom survived. The results demonstrate that surgical intervention is not associated with undue mortality but inappropriate conservative therapy is poorly tolerated in this high-risk group. \nMuch ado about gastrin [editorial; comment] The regulation of gastrin secretion from antral G-cells is of major importance in the physiologic control of acid secretion. Gastrin secretion is highly dependent upon gastric intraluminal pH and is inhibited significantly by a pH of less than 3.0. Acute gastric alkalinization greater than pH 6.0 with antisecretory agents such as H2-receptor antagonists or H+/K+ ATPase inhibitors has little impact on fasting serum gastrin levels but promotes an enhanced sustained rise in meal-stimulated gastrin release. Courses of standard therapy with both H2-antagonists and H+/K+ inhibitors cause a significant rise in 24 h integrated plasma gastrin levels that is inversely correlated to the 24-h integrated gastric acidity. The rise in fasting or integrated plasma gastrin levels observed in patients treated with H2-antagonists is small and of unclear clinical significance. Therapy with antisecretory agents leads to earlier ulcer relapse than with other agents. A variety of factors have been proposed to explain the earlier ulcer relapse rate, including secondary hypergastrinemia with rebound acid hypersecretion after discontinuation of the drug. Secondary hypergastrinemia may also lead to tolerance to prolonged courses of H2-antagonists therapy with a decrease in acid inhibition. This may contribute to break-through ulcer recurrence during maintenance H2-antagonist therapy. However, the relative importance of hypergastrinemia and tolerance to H2-antagonists compared with other factors such as baseline gastric acid secretion, smoking status, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and Helicobacter pylori status is difficult to assess. \nIndium-111-leukocyte imaging in acute cholecystitis. Eleven patients with suspected acute cholecystitis underwent sequential 99mTc-iminodiacetic derivative (IDA) and 111In-white blood cell (WBC) imaging to determine if 111In-WBCs accumulate within an acutely inflamed hemorrhagic gallbladder wall and, thus, could be employed as a reasonable alternative to 99mTc-IDA scintigraphy in detecting acute cholecystitis. Seven patients had surgically confirmed acute cholecystitis. Of these cases, five had a true-positive 99mTc-IDA and 111In-WBC, one an indeterminate 111In-WBC and true-positive 99mTc-IDA, and one a true-positive 111In-WBC and false-negative 99mTc-IDA scan. The remaining four patients did not have acute cholecystitis. All visualized their gallbladder within 1 hr after 99mTc-IDA administration and none had 111In-WBC gallbladder wall uptake. Both 111In-WBC and 99mTc-IDA scintigraphy accurately detected acute cholecystitis: hepatobiliary scintigraphy demonstrated a cystic duct obstruction and 111In-WBC imaging detected the inflammatory infiltrate within the gallbladder wall. The sensitivity and specificity of each was 86% and 100%, respectively. \nRecurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a clinical, univariate and multivariate analysis of response and survival with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. One hundred two patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer were entered into four consecutive phase II trials, all cisplatinum (C-DDP, 100 mg/m2/cycle)-based. The two combinations tried were C-DDP, bleomycin, and fluorouracil (CFB) on 54 patients, and cisplatinum and vindesin in 36 patients (CV). The CFB combination was given with C-DDP by continuous infusion over 96 hours (23 patients) or on day 1 (31 patients). The CV regimen was also given in two different schedules, with VDS at 3 mg/m2/g weekly (12 patients) or by a 96-hour continuous infusion (0.6 to 1.0 mg/m2/d) in 24 patients. The following variables: sex, age, performance status, previous therapy, local recurrence, length of disease-free interval (DFI), distant metastases, weight loss, primary site, histological differentiation, type of chemotherapy, previous chemotherapy, evaluable/measurable disease, erythrosedimentation rate, and their relation with response to chemotherapy (WHO) and survival were submitted to both univariate and multivariate analysis (Cox). Overall response rate (RR:CR + PR) was 25 (28%) of 90. In the CFB protocols, RR was 12 (22%) of 54 vs. 13 (38%) of 36 (P = 0.15, NS) in the CV combination group. For the four different combinations the RR was CFB C-DDPci 7 (30%) of 23, CFB C-DDP 1 hour 5 (16%) of 31, CV VDS weekly 2 (17%) of 12, CV VDSci 11 (45%) of 24. The patient populations were very different, with the latest combination consisting of metastatic patients exclusively. Univariate analysis of multiple variables showed age less than 60 years, PS:0 or 1, no previous therapy, absence of local relapse, metastatic disease, long DFI, and that measurable disease was significant for the probability of response. Median survival was 7 months for the 90 evaluated patients, 5 months for nonresponders, and 9 months for responders (P = 0.01). In the univariate analysis, significant factors for survival were PS:0 or 1, a weight loss below 10%, long DFI, response to chemotherapy, erythrosedimentation rate (ESR) of less than 30 mm/1st hr, presence of bone metastasis, and the number of metastases. Multivariate analysis shows PS, the absence of local relapse, and disease-free interval as significant prognostic factors for response. Multivariate analysis factors of significance for survival were PS, weight loss, and response to chemotherapy. The analysis of the clinical pattern showed an evolution in RR from 3 (8%) of 36 on previously irradiated local recurrent disease to 8 (73%) of 11 in previously untreated patients with metastatic disease at presentation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nVisual evoked potentials and background EEG activity in migraine. To investigate whether quantification of the background EEG during a visual evoked potential (VEP) study is of value for the diagnosis of migraine we studied 8 unmedicated migraineurs between attacks, and 10 age-matched controls. Three paradigms were used: the first two concerned pattern-reversal VEPs with different analysis times (500 and 1500 ms), and in the third paradigm the pattern did not reverse. Power spectra were calculated for individual responses, and the delta, theta, alpha and beta areas of the averaged spectra were noted as indicators of background reactivity. Alpha and beta powers were consistently but not significantly higher in the migraine group. The difference was too small to be of value as a diagnostic test. Alpha power was (not significantly) lower in the presence of photic stimulation than in its absence. As this was the case in both groups photic stimulation does not explain the higher alpha powers in the migraine group. We conclude that EEG background activity during the VEP does not distinguish reliably between migraineurs and controls. \nInterferon-gamma reverses bone marrow inhibition following hemorrhagic shock. Hemorrhagic shock has been demonstrated to alter the myelopoietic response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Interferon-gamma has been shown to improve the immune response following experimental shock and injury; however, its effect on myelopoiesis is controversial. This study was performed to determine whether treatment with interferon-gamma will improve the bone marrow response to lipopolysaccharide after hemorrhagic shock. Rats subjected to either shock or a sham procedure were allocated into three groups: (1) control rats received no further treatment; (2) lipopolysaccharide-treated rats received saline for 3 days and then were challenged with lipopolysaccharide to stimulate myelopoiesis; and (3) interferon-treated rats received interferon-gamma (7500 U subcutaneously 1 hour after shock and then every day for 3 days) and lipopolysaccharide as in group 2. Serum colony-stimulating factor levels were measured 6 hours and bone marrow white blood cell count and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) were measured 24 hours following lipopolysaccharide administration. In sham-treated rats, lipopolysaccharide increased CFU-GM 77% compared with controls. In contrast, treatment with lipopolysaccharide decreased CFU-GM 43% following shock. Treatment with interferon-gamma increased CFU-GM in all animals and reversed the decline in CFU-GM seen in shocked lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. Serum colony-stimulating factor levels were unaffected by either shock or interferon-gamma administration. These data demonstrate that interferon-gamma exerts a stimulatory effect on bone marrow following shock and restores the myelopoietic response to lipopolysaccharide. \nProliferative activity of neuroendocrine tumours of the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system: DNA flow cytometric and immunohistological investigations. The proliferative activity of 16 tumour specimens from 13 patients with neuroendocrine tumours of the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system was studied by DNA flow cytometry and immunohistology for the nuclear Ki67 proliferation antigen. Equivalent results were obtained with both methods, which showed the proliferative activity of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours to be heterogeneous. In four malignant small intestinal carcinoids and one extravisceral carcinoid localised in the retroperitoneum the percentage (index) of proliferating tumour cells as measured by DNA flow cytometry ranged from 2.9 to 36.2% corresponding to low, moderate, or high proliferative activity. In four malignant pancreatic endocrine tumours and their metastases indices ranged from 8.7 to 18.3%, corresponding to low, moderate, or high proliferative activity. In four benign pancreatic endocrine tumours indices ranged from 4.3 to 7.7%, all corresponding to low proliferative activity. This heterogeneity of proliferative activity may in part explain the heterogeneous results reported of chemotherapy treatment. As chemotherapy of tumours is largely affected by favourable cell cycling kinetics, individual diagnostic investigations of the proliferative activity of these neuroendocrine tumours may be of value for identifying patients suitable for this treatment. \nExperience with 225 hepatic resections for hepatocellular carcinoma over a 4-year period. During the past 4 1/2 years, we have performed hepatic resection on 225 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These patients included 171 men and 54 women, whose ages ranged from 29 to 84 years with an average of 60 years. Underlying cirrhosis of the liver was found in 67% of the patients and chronic hepatitis in 27%. Patients undergoing hepatic resection were classified into five groups according to curability as follows: Group A, resection of the tumor-bearing segment and one additional segment; Group B, complete resection of the tumor with more than 1.0 cm free surgical margin; Group C, complete resection of the tumor with less than 1.0 cm free surgical margin; Group D, incomplete resection of the tumor; Group E, surgical approach for advanced HCC with tumor thrombi in the main trunk or the first branch of the portal vein and/or the inferior vena cava, with multiple daughter nodules in both lobes and with tumor recurrence. The number of patients in Groups A, B, C, D, and E was 12 (5%), 83 (37%), 58 (26%), 14 (6%) and 58, (26%), respectively. There were 4 deaths (2.4%) among the 167 patients in Groups A to D within 30 days after operation and 12 deaths (20.7%) in Group E. The 3-year survival rate of Groups A, B, C, D, and E was 100%, 74%, 21%, 0%, and 35%, respectively. \nContralateral primary tumors in breast cancer patients in a randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy Prophylactic treatment with the anti-estrogen tamoxifen may reduce the risk of breast cancer because estrogens are thought to act as promoters in the pathogenesis of the disease. This article presents results on the incidence of contralateral new primary tumors among 1846 postmenopausal breast cancer patients included in a randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for 2 or 5 years after surgery versus no adjuvant endocrine therapy. The median follow-up was 7 years (range, 3-13 years). There was a significant reduction of contralateral breast cancer in the 931 patients in the tamoxifen group versus that in the 915 control patients (29 versus 47 cases, respectively; P = .03). The cumulative incidence at 10 years in the tamoxifen group and the control group was 5% and 8%, respectively. Analysis of the relative hazard of contralateral tumor over time showed that the benefit with tamoxifen therapy was greatest during the first 1-2 years, but there was a continued risk reduction during the entire follow-up period, i.e., more than 10 years after cessation of treatment. There was no significant difference in the number of contralateral cancers in the patients randomly assigned to 2 or 5 years of treatment, but the 95% confidence interval of the relative hazard was wide. The proportion of estrogen receptor-negative contralateral breast cancers was higher in the tamoxifen group than in the control group. There was no difference, however, between the two groups in recurrence-free survival time from the diagnosis of the contralateral cancer. \nImmunoblastic lymphoma with abundant clear cytoplasm. A comparative study of B- and T-cell types. The morphologic, phenotypic, molecular genetic, and clinical features of 34 cases of clear-cell immunoblastic lymphoma (IBLC) are described. Sixteen cases were of B-cell type (IBLC-B) and 18 cases were of T-cell type (IBLC-T). There were no significant differences in the morphologic characteristics of the neoplastic cells in the two types, although IBLC-B was less likely to be polymorphic than IBLC-T. Interfollicular proliferation, a higher mitotic rate, infiltration by eosinophils, and an increase in capillary-sized blood vessels were also features of IBLC-T, whereas necrosis and fibrosis were more extensive in IBLC-B. Patients with IBLC-B were predominantly female, whereas those with IBLC-T were predominantly male. The mean age was 62 years for those with IBLC-B and 46 years for those with IBLC-T. Patients with IBLC-B usually had lower-stage disease, but there was no significant difference in survival rate between those with IBLC-B and those with IBLC-T. Although most cases of IBLC have been considered to be of peripheral T-cell origin, the authors conclude that IBLC-B is more common than previously considered and that clear-cell morphologic characteristics are not a reliable indicator of T-cell type. \nImproved survival in patients with poor-prognosis malignant melanoma treated with adjuvant levamisole: a phase III study by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group Five hundred forty-three patients with completely resected malignant melanoma who were considered to have a significant risk of developing recurrent disease were randomized to one of four study groups. One group received levamisole 2.5 mg/kg on 2 consecutive days weekly for 3 years, a second group received bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for 3 years. A third group alternated 8-week courses of BCG and levamisole for 3 years and a fourth group underwent clinical assessment at the same frequency as the three treatment groups. The median duration of follow-up is 8.5 years. The percentage of reduction in the death rate and the recurrence rate in the treatment groups compared with the control group was calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model and adjusted for age, sex, and stage as covariants. The patients treated with levamisole were estimated to have a 29% reduction in both the death rate (P = .08) and the recurrence rate (P = .09) compared with patients receiving no further treatment. Fifty-five patients discontinued levamisole early because of gastrointestinal intolerance or arthralgia, myalgia, fever, and immune leukopenia. The patients treated with BCG alternating with levamisole experienced a 10% reduction in the death rate and a 6% reduction in the recurrence rate, and the patients treated with BCG alone experienced a 4% reduction in the death rate and a 3% increase in the recurrence rate compared with the control group. The degree of improvement experienced by the patients that were treated by levamisole is of sufficient magnitude to warrant further investigation of this dose of levamisole as adjuvant treatment in patients with melanoma. \nGlomerular hypertension in renovascular hypertensive patients. Split intrarenal hemodynamics in stenotic and contralateral kidneys of unilateral renovascular hypertension (RVH) were estimated by Gomez's formulae. Forty patients with essential hypertension and 40 patients with RVH were studied. Split para-amino hippurate and inulin clearances were measured by ureteral catheterization as indexes for effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates, allowing the estimation of intrarenal hemodynamics such as afferent arteriolar resistance (RA), efferent arteriolar resistance (RE) and glomerular hydrostatic pressure (PG) in each kidney. Normal values of intrarenal hemodynamic parameters were obtained in 24 normotensive subjects without ureteral catheterization, assuming each kidney had the half function of both kidneys. Systemic mean arterial pressure did not differ between essential and renovascular hypertension (141 +/- 3 vs. 148 +/- 3 mm Hg). Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates were decreased in the stenotic kidney of RVH (98 +/- 8, 24 +/- 2 ml/min/m2), while increased in the contralateral kidney (195 +/- 11, 48 +/- 2), compared with the right kidney of essential hypertension (162 +/- 8, 33 +/- 1). Although effective renal plasma flow rate was not different from normal (191 +/- 8), glomerular filtration rate was significantly higher in the contralateral kidney of RVH than in normal (38 +/- 1). RA was elevated due to the stenotic lesion in the stenotic kidney (28,500 +/- 1,900 dyns.sec.cm-5), while the elevation in the contralateral kidney (10,800 +/- 600) was less than in the right kidney of essential hypertension (14,900 +/- 1,200). RE (5,800 +/- 300) in both kidneys of RVH was higher than in the right kidney of essential hypertension (4,500 +/- 200). \nSmall intestinal lesion resembling graft-vs-host disease. A case report in immunodeficiency and review of the literature. We report graft-vs-host disease-like histology in a small intestinal biopsy specimen that was obtained from a patient with common variable immunodeficiency and related T-cell defect. We include findings from immunohistochemical studies and follow-up information. Review of the literature yielded only a small number of histologically documented cases of this lesion without previous bone marrow transplantation. Awareness of this clinicopathologic entity is important in the interpretation of gastrointestinal biopsy specimens. \nPhase I study of weekly intravenous infusions of CPT-11, a new derivative of camptothecin, in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. 7-Ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxy-camptothecin (CPT-11) is a novel camptothecin derivative that has been selected for clinical evaluation because of its broad spectrum of antitumor activity in animal models and its unique inhibitory effects on mammalian DNA topoisomerase I. Seventeen patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer were treated with CPT-11 at weekly dose levels ranging from 50 to 150 mg/m2. At least three weekly doses were given to all patients except four, and a total of 74 weekly doses were given to the 17 patients. The dose-limiting toxic effects were myelosuppression (predominantly leukopenia) and unpredictable diarrhea. Gastrointestinal toxic effects were severe and not well controlled by standard therapy in some patients. Interpatient variability of toxic effects was substantial (including two deaths) and did not correlate with the pharmacokinetic parameters of CPT-11 and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, its major metabolite. Two previously untreated patients, who received doses of 100 and 125 mg/m2, had partial responses lasting 3.2 and 4.0 months, respectively. The maximum tolerated dose on this schedule was 100 mg/m2, which we also recommend as a starting dose for phase II studies. This schedule appears to allow a CPT-11 dose intensity which is double the dose intensity possible on a once-a-month schedule. However, careful supervision to assess gastrointestinal toxic effects and myelosuppression is indispensable because of wide individual differences in drug tolerance. \nIncreased survival, limb preservation, and prognostic factors for osteosarcoma. Preoperative intraarterial (IA) cisplatin (CDP) was administered to 92 patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma. The ages of the patients ranged from 4 to 28 years. Sixty-four patients (70%) received 2 or 3 preoperative courses and 28 (30%) received 4 or more. Sixty-two specimens were available for pathologic examination to assess the degree of tumor necrosis. More than 90% tumor destruction was observed in 16 of 42 patients (38%) who received 1 to 3 preoperative courses as opposed to 17 of 20 (85%) who received 4 or more courses. Patients who received 4 or more courses had a 2-fold probability of achieving more than 90% tumor necrosis, and 68% underwent conservative surgery. Of those who received 3 or less courses, 23% underwent conservative surgery. Postoperatively, patients were treated with intravenous (IV) CDP alternating with doxorubicin (ADR) (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH). Pulmonary metastases developed in 36 patients, bone metastases in 2, and local recurrence in 6. Two patients died of cardiac failure without evidence of disease. Thus, 46 patients (50%) were continuously free of disease 18 to 78 months after diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that male sex, low grade preoperative chemotherapy-induced necrosis, and nonosteoblastic histologic condition were prognostic factors predictive of recurrence, while male sex and large tumor size were prognostic factors predictive of death. These results are comparable with those reported by other centers and are superior to our previous experiences that yielded survival rates of 5% to 10%. A substantial number of patients also had the opportunity to achieve tumor removal with conservative surgery. \nMesenchymoma of the chest wall in children. Benign chest wall mesenchymoma in children is an extremely rare disease. Only 20 patients have been reported in the world literature. We report a chest wall mesenchymoma in a 2-year-old boy who was admitted to the hospital after a routine chest roentgenogram showed a mass in the right upper chest wall. The patient was asymptomatic. Clinical examination was negative, but chest roentgenograms and computed tomography showed a mass in the right upper chest wall involving the third rib. A 2 x 2 x 1.5-cm tumor was excised totally with partial resection of the third rib. The histology of the lesion corresponded to a mesenchymoma (hamartoma) of the chest wall. Our patient has been followed up for 8 years without recurrence. \nManagement of chiasmal and hypothalamic gliomas of infancy and childhood with chemotherapy. Between March, 1983, and February, 1989, 19 infants or children with chiasmal/hypothalamic gliomas were treated with chemotherapy after either surgical or radiological diagnosis. The patients ranged in age from 15 weeks to 15.6 years (median 3.2 years) at the start of therapy. Twelve patients were treated immediately after diagnosis because of progressive symptoms, and seven received chemotherapy after either radiographic progression or clinical deterioration, including progressive visual loss or intracranial hypertension. Based on biopsy results, seven of these tumors were classified as juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, two as astrocytomas, two as highly anaplastic astrocytomas, and one as a subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. There was associated neurofibromatosis in four patients. The two initial patients were treated with either actinomycin D and vincristine or 5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and 6-thioguanine. The remaining patients received nitrosourea-based therapy; 15 evaluable patients were treated with a five-drug regimen that included 6-thioguanine, procarbazine, dibromodulcitol, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU), and vincristine and one received 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and 5-fluorouracil. Fifteen of the 18 evaluable patients initially managed with chemotherapy either responded to therapy or their condition stabilized. Median time to tumor progression has not been reached at a median follow-up period of 79 weeks (range 6.6 to 303 weeks), and no tumor-related death has occurred with a median follow-up period of 79 weeks (range 18 to 322 weeks) from the initiation of therapy. The four patients who failed therapy or whose disease progressed after chemotherapy were treated satisfactorily with radiation therapy. Initial improvement or stabilization of visual function was obtained in 16 patients. Endocrine function remained stable in all patients during treatment, although three patients required pharmacological treatment for endoc",
