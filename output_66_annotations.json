        "text": " bypass in six selected patients over the past four years. An alternative inflow source was selected because the standard transabdominal approach was contraindicated or considered hazardous. The inflow consisted of a single Dacron tube from the descending thoracic aorta to the left groin, and a femorofemoral bypass to the right groin. There was no operative mortality or major morbidity related to the surgical procedure. After an average follow-up of 17.1 months (range 6 to 23 months), all thoracofemoral grafts remained patent. One patient had repeated occlusions of the femorofemoral graft related to right lower extremity outflow disease, while the remaining five crossover grafts are patent. One patient died 22 months postoperatively from a myocardial infarct, with a patent bypass. Although this series represents a small group of patients, we feel that descending thoracic aortofemoral bypass offers excellent inflow and reliable patency, and is a good alternative when reoperation on the abdominal aorta is undesirable. This procedure may also be considered for conversion of an axillofemoral bypass that has failed repeatedly. \nDopamine agonists prevent duodenal ulcer relapse. A comparative study with famotidine and cimetidine. The present study investigated both the healing rate (after four weeks) and the relapse rate (during six months) following treatment with the dopamine-like drugs bromocriptine (2.5 mg twice daily), amantadine (100 mg nocte), or with the H2 blockers cimetidine (800 mg nocte), and famotidine (40 mg nocte) in 124 patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer (DU). The ulcer was completely healed in 27 (amantadine), 26 (bromocriptine), 23 (cimetidine), and in 24 (famotidine) patients. Relapse was noted in 34.7% (cimetidine) and 25% (famotidine) versus 11.7% (amantadine) and 7.7% (bromocriptine) DU patients. No significant difference was found in initial healing rates. However, the relapse rate in the cimetidine-treated group was significantly higher than in all the other test groups. Additional comparisons between all the treatment categories showed a significantly lower relapse rate with the dopamine-like agents. These important new results indicate that dopamine-like compounds are equally effective as H2 blockers in inducing DU healing and may offer a promising advantage over H2 blockers concerning their efficacy in preventing ulcer relapse in DU patients. \nSiriraj stroke score and validation study to distinguish supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage from infarction. OBJECTIVES--To develop a simple, reliable, and safe diagnostic tool for acute stroke syndromes in a setting where computerised brain scanning was not readily available and to validate its accuracy with regard to pathological types of stroke. DESIGN--13 clinical variables that potentially might differentiate supratentorial cerebral haemorrhage from infarction were recorded and tested by multivariate analysis in a prospective study of 174 patients with acute stroke. In developing the Siriraj stroke score stepwise discriminant analysis of the variables was followed by a linear discriminant equation to differentiate between supratentorial haemorrhage and infarction. The score obtained was validated against scores in 206 other patients with stroke, computerised brain scans being used for definitive diagnosis. SETTING--Siriraj Hospital Medical School, Mahidol University, Bangkok. SUBJECTS--Prospective study: 174 consecutive patients with acute supratentorial stroke syndrome (not subarachnoid haemorrhage) admitted to Siriraj Hospital during 1984-5; validation study: 206 patients admitted to Siriraj Hospital or another hospital for supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage or infarction. RESULTS--The Siriraj stroke score was developed and calculated as (2.5 x level of consciousness) + (2 x vomiting) + (2 x headache) + (0.1 x diastolic blood pressure) - (3 x atheroma markers) - 12. A score above 1 indicates supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage, while a score below -1 indicates infarction. The score between 1 and -1 represents an equivocal result needing a computerised brain scan or probability curve to verify the diagnosis. In the validation study of the Siriraj stroke score the diagnostic sensitivities of the score for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction were 89.3% and 93.2% respectively, with an overall predictive accuracy of 90.3%. CONCLUSION--The Siriraj stroke score is widely accepted and applied in hospitals throughout Thailand as a simple and reliable bedside method for diagnosing acute stroke. \nEffect of heroin in decomposing tissues on the development rate of Boettcherisca peregrina (Diptera, Sarcophagidae) and implications of this effect on estimation of postmortem intervals using arthropod development patterns. Larvae of the flesh fly Boettcherisca peregrina (Robineau-Desvoidy) were reared on the tissues of rabbits to study the effects of heroin on the development rates of this species. The rabbits were given 6, 12, 18, and 24 mg of heroin by cardiac puncture. From Hours 18 to 96, larvae feeding on tissues containing heroin (as morphine) developed more rapidly than those feeding on tissues from the control. The time required for pupation was significantly greater for colonies fed on tissues from heroin-dosed rabbits than for the control colony. The differences observed in the rates of development were sufficient to alter postmortem interval estimates based on larval development by up to 29 h and estimates based on pupal development by 18 to 38 h. \nRecent trends in acute care hospital utilization in Ontario for diseases of the circulatory system. OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in the use of acute care hospital services for diseases of the circulatory system in Ontario. DESIGN: Observational study. DATA EXTRACTION: Information on diagnoses, procedures and demographic characteristics was obtained from routinely collected computerized abstracts of separations from all acute care hospitals in Ontario during 1979-80, 1983-84 and 1988-89. The data were combined with population estimates to calculate overall separation rates and rates specific for age, diagnosis and procedure. Resource intensity weights were used to estimate changes in resource use. MAIN RESULTS: The overall separation rate increased by 3% and the resource-intensity-weighted separation rate by 12% from 1979-80 to 1988-89. The overall medical separation rate increased by 2%, whereas the surgical rate increased by 12%. The surgical separation rate increased among patients 55 to 79 years of age but decreased in all the other adult age groups. The separation rates for coronary artery bypass surgery and cardiac valve surgery increased rapidly among patients 65 years of age or older. The medical separation rate decreased for patients of all ages except those less than 5 years and those 80 years or more. The medical separation rates decreased by less than 1% for diagnoses related to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and increased dramatically for coronary artery revascularization. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing elderly population has not resulted in large increases in acute care hospital utilization for diseases of the circulatory system. The impact of an aging population has been balanced by decreased utilization rates in the younger groups. The intensity of hospital care has risen primarily because of increases in surgical rates, especially in the elderly population. The large decrease in the rate of death from IHD over the past two decades has not been associated with similar decreases in acute care hospital utilization for this disorder. \nSomatostatin receptors in differentiated ovarian tumors. The presence of somatostatin receptors was investigated in 57 primary human ovarian tumors using in vitro receptor autoradiography with three different somatostatin radioligands, 125I-[Tyr11]-somatostatin-14, 125I-[Leu8, D-Trp22, Tyr25]-somatostatin-28, or 125I-[Tyr3]-SMS 201-995. Three cases, all belonging to epithelial tumors, were receptor positive; specifically 1 of 42 adenocarcinomas, 1 of 3 borderline malignancies, and 1 of 2 cystadenomas. Four other epithelial tumors (3 fibroadenomas, 1 Brenner tumor), 4 sex cord-stromal tumors (2 fibrothecomas, 2 granulosa cell tumors), and 2 germ cell tumors (1 dysgerminoma, 1 teratoma) were receptor negative. In the positive cases, the somatostatin receptors were localized on epithelial cells exclusively, were of high affinity (KD = 4.6 nmol/l [nanomolar]), and specific for somatostatin analogs. These receptors bound somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 radioligands with a higher affinity than the octapeptide [Tyr3]-SMS 201-995. Healthy ovarian tissue had no somatostatin receptors. A subpopulation of relatively well-differentiated ovarian tumors, therefore, was identified pathobiochemically on the basis of its somatostatin receptor content. This small group of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors may be a target for in vivo diagnostic imaging with somatostatin ligands. \nNatural history and effectiveness of aspirin in asymptomatic patient with cervical bruits. The Asymptomatic Cervical Bruit Study Group. We report a multicenter study in progress involving a prospective follow-up of asymptomatic patients with cervical bruits. The project consists of two components. All patients meeting clinical criteria for eligibility undergo duplex ultrasonography at the time of entry into the study. Those with a carotid stenosis of 50% or greater are enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of aspirin. All other patients are followed up in a natural history study, also involving biannual clinical and duplex ultrasonographic examinations. Both clinical and anatomic outcomes are assessed. The project consists of a 3-year accrual phase and a 3-year follow-up phase with completion planned for May 1994. Total anticipated enrollment is 588 patients. \nPediatric heart transplantation at Stanford: results of a 15-year experience. The long-term results of pediatric heart transplantation were evaluated in 53 patients, aged 0.25 to 18.94 years, who received transplants at Stanford University Medical Center between 1974 and 1989. Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (68%), congenital heart disease (21%), endocardial fibroelastosis (8%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (3%). Immunosuppression was achieved with combinations of cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine. Thirty-seven of 42 recipients leaving the hospital after transplantation were alive and in New York Heart Association class I at study's end. Cumulative survival was 79% at 1 year, 76% at 3 years, and 69% at 5 years. Fourteen recipients have survived more than 5 years (5.1 to 12.4 years). Hospital readmission for illness has been infrequent, decreasing from 6.8 days to 0.9 days per year over 5 years. Eleven patients have required no rehospitalization. Posttransplant deaths were due to infection (19%), rejection (4%), pulmonary hypertension (4%), coronary artery disease (2%), and lymphoproliferative disease (2%). Retransplantation was required for intractable rejection in 4 patients and advanced coronary artery disease in 2. Hypertension and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were common in individuals receiving cyclosporine. Growth was often impaired in prepubertal children receiving daily prednisone. Based on this 15-year experience, it is concluded that heart transplantation represents a reasonable alternative for selected young patients with end-stage cardiac disease. \nAvoiding reoperation for indeterminate thyroid nodules identified as malignant after surgery. Thyroid nodules that are indeterminate as carcinoma by needle biopsy before surgery and by study of frozen sections at the time of surgery are occasionally identified to be malignant in later studies. If only a lobectomy has been performed, the advisability of reoperation to remove the remaining thyroid tissue to facilitate radioactive iodine therapy may cause concern. To obviate this difficulty as well as to reduce the occurrence of nodules later in a preserved contralateral thyroid lobe and to provide additional thyroid tissue for study, contralateral subtotal or near total lobectomy has been performed for indeterminate thyroid nodules. The small remnant of remaining thyroid tissue can later be ablated by radioactive iodine if desired. Of 37 patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules, none required reoperation, although the diagnosis of carcinoma was established after surgery for eight patients, three of whom were treated with radioactive iodine. \nHuman hepatocyte growth factor in blood of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Basic aspects. Human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) was purified from the plasma of six patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to hepatitis B in two and non-A, non-B hepatitis in four. The purified hHGF from each patient contained two major protein bands having molecular weights of 79,000 and 86,000 and several minor bands having molecular weights between 76,000 and 92,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed under nonreduced conditions. After reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, three major bands having molecular weights of 58,000, 34,500, and 31,500 were evident. In addition, a band having a molecular weight of 21,000 was detected. hHGF activity was destroyed by its reduction. The hHGF purified from patients demonstrated a dose response in terms of an increase in DNA synthesis using cultured hepatocytes. The hHGF concentration in the plasma of the patients with grade III-IV hepatic coma was calculated to be in the range of 1.8-3.0 nM. Finally the heavy chain of hHGF was not recognized by an anti-human albumin antibody, indicating that hHGF is not biliprotein, an albumin-bilirubin complex, that has been reported to be a putative liver growth factor. \nPopulation-based study of surgery in juvenile onset Crohn's disease. A geographically based cohort of 68 children with Crohn's disease was derived by sampling from Scottish Hospital In-patient Statistics. Surgical histories were examined and analysed by actuarial methods, and the nature of major operations performed was compared with operations for Crohn's disease in the Lothians' Surgical Audit. Fifty-four of the 68 patients were treated surgically, with a total of 135 operations (71 major, 64 minor). Fifty per cent of the cohort had a major operation within 5 years of onset of symptoms; median time to a second operation was 4 years. The types of major operation performed in juvenile onset patients differed significantly from those recorded in the Lothians' audit, with a high rate of exploratory laparotomy in younger patients (12 cases). With a mean follow-up of 7 years, 12 patients (18 per cent) have a permanent stoma. There were five deaths, three postoperative. This study highlights the frequency of surgical intervention in young people with Crohn's disease. \nEndothelial modulation of vascular tone: relevance to coronary angioplasty and restenosis. The vascular endothelium importantly modulates many biochemical and physiologic properties of the vascular wall, including the release of potent vasoactive factors, maintenance of an anticoagulant state and modulation of vascular growth by the release of both proliferative and antiproliferative substances. Prominent among these endothelial roles is the production of a potent vasodilator or family of vasodilators termed the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, one of which has been identified to be nitric oxide or a closely related compound. Several diseases that commonly occur in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty alter many facets of endothelial function and may predispose to adverse clinical sequelae of angioplasty, including immediate thrombosis, restenosis and vascular spasm. Several features of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, how it is altered by pathologic processes and how these considerations relate to the immediate and late postangioplasty periods are discussed. \nEvaluation of the traveler. An introduction to emporiatrics for the emergency physician. Travel medicine, or emporiatrics, presents an additional challenge to the practicing emergency physician. In this time of increased travel for business and pleasure, travel history should become a routine part of patient evaluation. While the emergency physician may not need to become facile with specific details concerning immunizations and prophylaxis, he or she should have a good working knowledge of these in order to provide the potential traveler with some basic information and to be able to adequately evaluate the returned traveler who becomes ill and seeks care. Air travel allows many travelers to arrive back in the United States before manifesting symptoms and signs of illness acquired abroad. Many of these illnesses are not usually found in the United States. Late diagnosis of certain illnesses, such as falciparum malaria, may increase the morbidity and mortality. As such, travel history should become a routine part of patient evaluation, and the physician should have a good working knowledge of illnesses that may be acquired abroad. \nMaximal sniff mouth pressure compared with maximal inspiratory pressure in acute respiratory failure. Inspiratory muscle strength most often is better reflected by sniff Pes than PImax against occlusion. Furthermore, sniff Pes can be estimated noninvasively by the measurement of sniff Pmo in normal subjects and in patients with respiratory muscle weakness. The aim of this study was to compare sniff Pmo and P.PImax to assess inspiratory muscle strength in patients with acute respiratory failure. The highest pressure was produced by P.PImax in 61 percent of measurements, and by sniff Pmo in 39 percent. Above 35 cm H2O P.PImax yielded the highest pressure in 55 percent of cases and the ratio sniff Pmo/P.PImax was 1.20 +/- 0.54. Below 35 cm H2O, P.PImax yielded the highest pressure in 75 percent of cases and the ratio sniff Pmo/P.PImax was 0.76 +/- 0.35 (p less than 0.02). Thus, measurements of sniff Pmo and P.PImax complement one another for assessing inspiratory muscle strength. However, sniff Pmo underestimates inspiratory muscle strength in patients with severe inspiratory muscle weakness. \nClinical usefulness of serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen for early detection of squamous cell carcinoma arising in mature cystic teratoma of the ovary. Squamous cell carcinoma arising in mature cystic teratoma of the ovary is rarely diagnosed preoperatively. We measured the pre-treatment serum levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen in three stage I patients in order to evaluate its usefulness as a tumor marker for early detection of the disease. The serum levels were elevated in each case, to 26.9, 5.1, and 3.2 ng/mL, respectively, and rapidly dropped to within the normal range after treatment. All patients are recovered and show no evidence of recurrence, and the levels of serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen have remained within normal limits. These results suggest that measurement of the serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen level may be useful in diagnosing an early-stage primary squamous cell carcinoma arising in a mature cystic teratoma of the ovary. An elevated preoperative serum level of squamous cell carcinoma antigen may indicate the need for a rapid pathologic examination of the tumor to look for malignant elements and may influence the surgical regimen. \nMacroreentry in the infarcted human heart: the mechanism of ventricular tachycardias with a \"focal\" activation pattern. Endocardial mapping of electrical activity was carried out in 150 patients to guide antiarrhythmic surgery for drug-resistant ventricular tachycardia in the chronic phase of myocardial infarction. In 20 of these patients, the activation pattern of 27 distinct tachycardias was focal and diastolic potentials were recorded at three or more sites. In 26 tachycardias, the sequence of diastolic potentials progressed from the area of latest activation of one cycle toward the \"origin\" of the next cycle. In two patients, the heart was stimulated during tachycardia, resulting in entrainment of the tachycardia in both. Late potentials were recorded during entrainment at sites where diastolic potentials occurred during tachycardia. In 11 of the 20 patients, endocardial mapping was performed during sinus rhythm. In four of these, late potentials were observed during sinus rhythm at sites where diastolic potentials were recorded during tachycardia. In two patients without late potentials during sinus rhythm, late potentials were observed during stimulation and induced ectopic beats. The results support the concept that the mechanism of several of these tachycardias is based on reentry in a macrocircuit comprising a tract of surviving tissue traversing the infarct and the remaining healthy tissue. They also indicate that the absence of late potentials during sinus rhythm does not guarantee the absence of arrhythmogenic pathways. \nPrehospital diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction: a north-south perspective. The Cincinnati Heart Project and the Nashville Prehospital TPA Trial. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy improves left ventricular function and reduces mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In European and Middle Eastern trials, prehospital delivery of thrombolytic agents by physician-directed mobile intensive care units has been successful. This report describes two independently conceived and performed trials that used cellular telephone transmission of 12-lead ECGs to deliver recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) in the field to patients with AMI. In the Nashville Prehospital TPA Trial, 85 patients with chest pain were evaluated in the field for possible administration of r-tPA over a 6-month period. Three of 85 patients (3.5%) were found to be actual candidates for r-tPA treatment in the field. In phase II (dry-run phase) of the Cincinnati Heart Project, 374 patients were evaluated in the field with 14 documented cases of AMI (3.7%) before r-tPA was placed in ambulances for administration by paramedics. In phase III (active with r-TPA in ambulances), over a 1-year period 103 patients were evaluated with six (5.8%) documented cases of AMI. Three of five r-tPA field treatment decisions by emergency physicians using transmitted 12-lead ECGs were accurate (60%). When patients in phases II and III were combined, only 20 of 477 total patients (4.2%) were documented to have AMI. A decline in paramedic skills was noted because of the infrequent administration of the thrombolytic agent. Combining the Nashville and Cincinnati experiences, only 27 of 562 total patients with chest pain (4.8%) were candidates for prehospital thrombolysis. We conclude that few patients evaluated in the prehospital setting are actual candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Substantial allocation of financial and human resources for prehospital delivery of intravenous thrombolytic therapy does not appear warranted. \nRole of estrogens and epidermal growth factor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Estrogen (E) and epidermal growth factors (EGF) receptors were assayed in the liver of nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Total E and nuclear E receptors were decreased significantly in neoplastic tissue as compared to the levels found in surrounding nonneoplastic tissue. The EGF receptor was decreased also in neoplastic tissue. On the basis of binding data, a decrease in the number but not in affinity of both the E and EGF receptors was found. \nSelective amplification of periportal transitional cells precedes formation of hepatocellular carcinoma in SV40 large tag transgenic mice. In a major urinary protein (MUP)-promoter/simian virus 40 (SV40)Tag transgenic mouse line (MT-D2) the liver-directed, androgen-regulated transgene expression leads to synchronized pathology resulting in a stepwise progression to multiple hepatocellular carcinomas. SV40Tag-activated replication gives rise to two different preneoplastic alterations in hepatocytes, which are characterized in detail: 1) dysplasia and finally cell death in the original hepatocyte population and 2) amplification of periportal transitional hepatocytes leading to multifocal hyperplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma. Multifocal hyperplasia, most probably the equivalent of SV40Tag-immortalization, grows confluent and leads to hepatomegaly. SV40Tag-independent, secondary events are necessary for the tumor development from confluent hyperplasia. This allows further investigation of the steps involved in malignant transformation and progression during hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo. \nFamilial breast-ovarian cancer locus on chromosome 17q12-q23. Familial breast cancer has been linked to the D17S74 locus on chromosome 17q. To confirm this finding and to investigate whether ovarian cancer is also linked to this locus, five large families with a hereditary predisposition to cancer of the breast and ovary were investigated. Three families were positive for linkage. For the largest family the lod score was 2.72. These findings suggest that the chromosomal region 17q12-q23, previously shown to contain a gene for early-onset breast cancer, is also associated with a proportion of hereditary ovarian cancers. \nPentoxifylline inhibits interleukin-2-induced leukocyte-endothelial adherence and reduces systemic toxicity. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) mediates the regression of metastatic cancer, but clinical application has been limited by the induction of dose-dependent toxicities in normal tissues. The most clinically significant toxicities occur secondary to a vascular leak syndrome and include acute respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability. Because previous studies suggested a role for pentoxifylline in attenuating the toxic effects of IL-2, we hypothesized that pentoxifylline would inhibit alterations in the microvasculature induced by IL-2 and would ultimately reduce IL-2-induced toxicity. To determine the validity of this hypothesis, we prepared four groups of rats for in vivo microvascular observation. In the first group, a bolus intravenous injection of IL-2 (1 x 10(6) units/kg) acutely induced hypotension, tachypnea, hypoxia, increased lung water, decreased microvascular blood flow, and increased leukocyte-endothelial adherence. No significant changes occurred in animals treated by pentoxifylline alone or the control IL-2 vehicle-alone group. However, pentoxifylline inhibited many of the IL-2-induced systemic and microvascular effects, such as hypotension, tachypnea, increased lung water, hypoxia, and increased leukocyte-endothelial adherence, but not tachycardia or increased microvascular protein leakage. These data support our hypothesis that systemic toxicities induced by IL-2 are associated with alterations in the microcirculation, which may be ameliorated by pentoxifylline. \nDipyridamole thallium-201 scintigraphy as a preoperative screening test. A reexamination of its predictive potential. Study of Perioperative Ischemia Research Group BACKGROUND. We examined the value of dipyridamole thallium-201 (201Tl) scintigraphy as a preoperative screening test for perioperative myocardial ischemia and infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. We prospectively studied 60 patients undergoing elective vascular surgery. We performed 201Tl scintigraphy preoperatively and blinded all treating physicians to the results. Historical, clinical, laboratory, and physiological data were gathered throughout hospitalization. Myocardial ischemia was assessed during the intraoperative period using continuous 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and during the postoperative period using continuous two-lead ambulatory ECG. Adverse cardiac outcomes (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, severe ischemia, or congestive heart failure) were assessed daily throughout hospitalization. Twenty-two patients (37%) had defects that improved or reversed on delayed scintigrams (redistribution defects), 18 (30%) had persistent defects, and 20 (33%) had no defects on 201Tl scintigraphy. There was no association between redistribution defects and adverse cardiac outcomes: 54% (seven of 13) of adverse outcomes occurred in patients without redistribution defects, and the risk of an adverse outcome was not significantly increased in patients with redistribution defects (relative risk 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.6-3.9, p = 0.43). Consistent with these findings, there was also no association between redistribution defects and perioperative ischemia: 54% (19 of all 35) of perioperative ECG and TEE ischemic episodes and 58% (14 of 24) of severe ischemic episodes occurred in patients without redistribution defects. The sensitivity of 201Tl scintigraphy for perioperative ischemia and adverse outcomes ranged from 40% to 54%, specificity from 65% to 71%, positive predictive value from 27% to 47% and negative predictive value from 61% to 82%. CONCLUSIONS. These results differ from those of previous studies and suggest that the routine use of 201Tl scintigraphy for preoperative screening of patients undergoing vascular surgery may not be warranted. \nGenetic and environmental explanations for the distribution of sodium-lithium countertransport in pedigrees from Rochester, MN. An elevated level of erythrocyte sodium-lithium (Na-Li) countertransport has been suggested as a predictor of predisposition to essential hypertension. In order to evaluate whether a single genetic or environmental factor with large effects explains the mixture of distributions in Na-Li countertransport in the general population, complex segregation analyses were conducted by using 1,273 individuals more than age 20 years from 276 pedigrees selected without respect to disease risk factors or health status. Either a single genetic locus or a single environmental factor with large gender-specific effects explained the mixture of distributions for Na-Li countertransport in this sample equally well. In the subsample of pedigrees supporting a single-locus etiology, the single genetic locus explained 29.0% of the variability in adjusted Na-Li countertransport in males and 16.6% of that in females. In a subsample of pedigrees supporting an environmental factor etiology, the environmental factor explained 35.2% of the adjusted Na-Li countertransport in males and 20.5% of that in females. These results suggest that there are at least two different explanations for the mixture of distributions in Na-Li countertransport in the general population. Attempts to relate genetic variation in Na-Li countertransport to risk of essential hypertension must consider that the factor with large phenotypic effects on this trait is gender specific and may not be a single major locus in all pedigrees. \nCharacterization of the decay-accelerating factor gene promoter region. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) expression modulates susceptibility of cells to autologous complement attack. To characterize the regulatory region controlling DAF gene transcription, genomic DNA extending from 815 base pairs (bp) upstream to approximately 4 kilobases downstream of DAF's AUG codon (designated +1) was cloned and sequenced. The 5' flanking sequence showed 59-76% G + C content (-355 to +1), at least one GC box(es) (-135 to -131), and variable length sequences (from -629 to -285) conforming to the motifs TCCTCC and TCn. Nuclease S1 digestions and primer extensions localized a major transcriptional start site to -82/-81, 38 bp downstream of a possible TATA variant, (A)TTTAA. In COS cell transfections, the sequence encompassing -815 to -67 functioned 2.5% as efficiently as the Rous sarcoma virus 3' long terminal repeat, but following deletion upstream of -355 its activity increased approximately 4-fold. Two octanucleotides exhibiting partial homology to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and cAMP responsive elements (PREs and CREs, respectively) were detected, and the respective modulators enhanced transcriptional efficiency 2- and approximately 10-fold, respectively. Thus, the DAF gene promoter (i) exhibits sequences resembling both conventional and unconventional transcriptional control elements, (ii) possesses a region with negative regulatory activity, and (iii) responds to PMA and cAMP induction presumably via PRE- and CRE-like enhancer elements. \nSimple noninvasive method to test efficacy of drugs in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection: the example of combined bismuth subsalicylate and nitrofurantoin. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infections has proved to be difficult. There is a need both for improved therapies and for ways to rapidly identify therapies that show sufficient promise to be worth pursuing. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the value of a therapeutic regimen of a bismuth salt plus nitrofurantoin for eradication of infection by H. pylori and to determine the validity/utility of the urea breath test in monitoring the progress of a clinical trial. We used an 80% eradication rule to define a promising therapeutic regimen, i.e., a regimen that eradicated the infection (no evidence of infection by H. pylori 4 wk after termination of therapy) in at least 80% of the individuals treated. Eighteen men (median age 38) with documented infection by H. pylori completed the study. At the end-of-study evaluation, H. pylori infection was eradicated (negative urea breath test, culture, and histology) in only one of 18 (5.5%) subjects; 15 were positive by the urea breath test, 16 by culture, 15 by Warthin-Starry stain, and 16 by the presence of acute-on-chronic inflammation. Using the 80% eradication rule, any one of these tests alone would have identified that the combination of antimicrobials tested was not effective in the eradication of the infection. We conclude that the urea breath test is a simple, noninvasive, cost-effective method to separate promising from unpromising candidate therapies and for the evaluation of new therapeutic concepts. \nExcimer laser-facilitated balloon angioplasty of a nondilatable lesion. Preliminary clinical experience with excimer laser coronary angioplasty shows that it is a safe and effective means of achieving nonsurgical coronary revascularization in selected patients but specific indications for its use are as yet undefined. In the present report a specific indication is proposed for the use of the excimer laser: to facilitate balloon inflation in a rigid stenosis that fails to dilate despite high balloon inflation pressures. \nConfirming the theoretical structure of the McGill Pain Questionnaire in acute clinical pain. Based upon a tripartite theoretical model of pain, the Pain Rating Index (PRI) of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) continues to be one of the most frequently used instruments to measure clinical pain. Although a number of exploratory factor analytic studies have failed to consistently support the theoretical structure of the instrument, one previous confirmatory factor analytic study of chronic pain did statistically support the a priori model. Because it has been suggested that acute pain may not involve the same dimensions as chronic pain, this study provided a direct test of the theoretical structure of the MPQ through multi-sample confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using data provided by women experiencing pain during labor (n = 185) and women experiencing acute postoperative pain (n = 192). Results of the LISREL CFA analysis indicated that the a priori, 3-factor, oblique model originally proposed by Melzack provided the most parsimonious representation of the data across the 2 samples of acute pain. \nProphylactic sclerotherapy in high-risk cirrhotics selected by endoscopic criteria. A multicenter randomized controlled trial. Controlled trials of sclerotherapy for the prevention of the first variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotics have given conflicting results. In the present study, 106 cirrhotics were randomized to sclerotherapy (55 patients) or control group (51 patients). Admission criteria were no history of previous variceal bleeding and the presence of high-risk varices, i.e., a variceal score less than or equal to 0 according to Beppu et al. Sclerotherapy sessions were performed at time zero, 7 days, 30 days, and then monthly until eradication. Follow-up endoscopies were performed at 6-month intervals thereafter. Control patients underwent repeat endoscopy at 6-month intervals. Bleeding episodes were treated by sclerotherapy in both groups, whenever possible. Mean follow-up was 24 months. Analysis of the results was performed by the intention-to-treat method. Variceal bleeding occurred in 19 sclerotherapy patients (34.5%) and in 17 controls (35.4%, P = NS). Overall mortality was 34.5% in sclerotherapy patients and 50% in controls (P = NS). Seven of the 19 sclerotherapy patients (36.8%) and 11 of the 17 controls (64.7%) who bled died of hemorrhage (P less than 0.05, log-linear model). It is concluded that prophylactic sclerotherapy does not reduce the incidence of first variceal bleeding in cirrhotics. However, there seems to be a trend toward a lower bleeding-related mortality in sclerotherapy patients than in controls. \nElectrophysiologic effects of isoproterenol in patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia treated with flecainide. The electrophysiologic effects of isoproterenol in patients treated with flecainide for atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia were studied to evaluate the mechanism of tachycardia inducibility after isoproterenol and the value of isoproterenol challenge as a predictor of spontaneous arrhythmia recurrence. Seventeen patients underwent electrophysiologic study before and after oral flecainide administration and after the addition of isoproterenol to flecainide. No patient had inducible sustained supraventricular tachycardia after flecainide alone. Two patients had inducible sustained and six had inducible nonsustained tachycardia after isoproterenol was added to flecainide. The patients were then followed up on the same flecainide dose they received at the time of the electrophysiologic study. Findings: 1) Flecainide treatment prolonged HV and VA intervals, and the addition of isoproterenol did not affect these variables. 2) Isoproterenol shortened anterograde and retrograde block cycle length and the refractory period of the accessory pathway and the AV node. It also decreased the tachycardia cycle length, an effect that was due solely to shortening of AV node conduction time. 3) Flecainide treatment prevented tachycardia induction by affecting retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway. Isoproterenol allowed for tachycardia induction and for more sustained episodes of tachycardia by reversing the effect of flecainide on retrograde accessory pathway conduction. 4) Tachycardia recurred during follow-up in all three patients in whom tachycardia of greater than or equal to 10 s duration was induced after isoproterenol but in no patient who had no or shorter episodes of induced tachycardia (and who did not have a change in medical regimen). Conclusions: 1) Isoproterenol reverses flecainide-induced prolongation of block cycle length and refractory periods of the accessory pathway and AV node. 2) Isoproterenol reverses flecainide-induced prevention of tachycardia induction through reversal of the effects of flecainide on the retrograde accessory pathway. 3) The addition of isoproterenol during flecainide restudy is valuable in predicting long-term drug efficacy. \nScreening for colon malignancy with colonoscopy. Screening of asymptomatic individuals for colon malignancy has been advocated for the past 20 yr in the hopes of reducing colon cancer mortality. Although sigmoidoscopy is an important element of current screening recommendations, the sensitivity of this test in asymptomatic subjects has never been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and location of polyps and cancers in an asymptomatic population by performing full colonoscopy. We wished to assess the sensitivity of screening flexible sigmoidoscopy to 60 cm by determining how many patients with adenomas or cancer had \"index\" adenomatous polyps in the distal 60 cm. One hundred five healthy male outpatients, over 50 yr old, with negative examinations for occult blood in stools and no prior history of colon pathology, had full colonoscopy. Careful examination of the distal 60 cm was performed, followed by a full colon examination to the cecum. Forty-three patients (41%) had adenomatous polyps, and only 19 of these patients had an index adenomatous polyp in the distal 60 cm. Therefore, the sensitivity of sigmoidoscopy was 44%. The prevalence of adenomas increased with age. Patients were assigned to one of three groups based on the findings in the distal 60 cm. Group 1 (n = 65) had no polyps in the distal 60 cm, but 18 of these patients (28%) had adenomatous polyps in the proximal colon. Among 21 patients with only hyperplastic polyps in the distal 60 cm (group 2), six patients (29%) had proximal adenomas. In group 3, eight of 19 patients (42%) with adenomas in the distal 60 cm also had proximal adenomatous polyps. We conclude that adenomatous polyps are common in asymptomatic men who have negative tests for fecal occult blood. Sigmoidoscopy to 60 cm had a sensitivity of only 44% in this patient population, suggesting that this is an insensitive test for the detection of patients with adenomatous polyps. \nNatural anticoagulants in systemic lupus erythematosus. Deficiency of protein S bound to C4bp associates with recent history of venous thromboses, antiphospholipid antibodies, and the antiphospholipid syndrome. The association of thrombosis with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) could be due to their interference with natural phospholipid dependent anticoagulant mechanisms. We studied antigenic protein C (APC), functional protein C (FPC), free protein S (FPS), protein S bound to C4 binding protein (C4bp-S), antithrombin III (ATIII), as well as IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 38 patients with SLE with a history of thromboses and 70 patients with SLE without such history. We found a high frequency of deficiencies of natural anticoagulants in both groups of patients with SLE but, because of patient selection, we could not determine the actual prevalence of these defects. Patients having had a venous thrombosis in the previous year had low C4bp-S more frequently than patients with older or no thromboses. When we divided our patients with SLE into those who had a definite, probable, questionable or no antiphospholipid syndrome (aPS) we found the frequency of C4bp-S deficiency to be significantly higher in those with definite aPS than in those without aPS. Intermediate proportions were found in patients with probable and questionable aPS. The levels of C4bp-S decreased as the levels of aCL, particularly IgG, increased. Stepwise discriminant analysis of natural anticoagulants selected deficiencies of C4bp-S and FPC with increased ATIII as a set of variables with highest predictive power for classification of patients with and without aPS. Thus, deficiencies of natural anticoagulants may occur frequently in patients with SLE. \nPsychiatric aspects of headache. Psychological factors, such as psychological stressors, personality style, conditioning, and psychodynamic issues, play a role in the etiology of chronic migraine and muscle contraction headaches. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, personality disorders, conversion, and hypochondriasis, may accompany and complicate headache. Psychiatric diagnosis and treatment add a useful and important dimension to the medical care of the patient. This article presented a useful conceptual model for discriminating between different kinds of psychological influencing factors and guidelines for selecting the appropriate form of psychiatric treatment. \nRegulation of phospholipase D and primary granule secretion by P2-purinergic- and chemotactic peptide-receptor agonists is induced during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. We have compared the abilities of extracellular ATP (acting via P2-purinergic receptors) and formylated peptides (FMLP) to stimulate both phospholipase D (PLD)-based signal transduction and primary granule (azurophilic) secretion in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway. In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, neither ATP nor FMLP elicited significant PLD activation or increased secretion despite the previously documented ability of ATP to stimulate large increases in polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization. Conversely, within 1 d after induction of granulocytic differentiation by dibutyryl cAMP, both ATP and FMLP induced large increases in azurophilic secretion and corresponding increases in PLD activity. ATP-activated PLD activity was near-maximal within 1 d after dibutyryl cAMP treatment, while the FMLP-induced activity increased continuously over 4 d, with a maximal level twice that stimulated by ATP. Additional experiments characterized the activation of PLD by receptor-independent pathways at different stages of differentiation; these included studies of phorbol ester action in intact cells and GTP gamma S action in electropermeabilized cells. An apparent role for guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins in PLD regulation was also indicated by the significant reduction in FMLP- and ATP-stimulated PLD activity observed in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin. At all stages of differentiation, there was good correlation between the relative efficacies of ATP versus FMLP in stimulating both secretion and PLD activity. These data indicate: (a) that the receptor-regulated phospholipase D signaling pathway is induced during differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells; and (b) that differential activation of this signaling system by various Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptor agonists may underlie the differential regulation of secretion and other phagocyte functions by such agents. \nHelicobacter pylori-associated exaggerated gastrin release in duodenal ulcer patients. The effect of bombesin infusion and urea ingestion. Recent studies have shown that the exaggerated meal-stimulated gastrin release in patients with duodenal ulcer abates after eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection. Bombesin-stimulated gastrin release was compared in 11 H. pylori-infected patients with chronic duodenal ulcer and 8 uninfected healthy volunteers both before and after therapy to eradicate H. pylori. Bombesin infusion significantly increased the gastrin release both in control subjects and in patients with duodenal ulcer. Antimicrobial therapy (bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole) to eradicate the H. pylori infection was associated with a significant reduction in bombesin-stimulated gastrin release in patients with duodenal ulcer (from 116.9 +/- 19 pg/mL to 69.5 +/- 7 pg/mL following 50 pmol.kg-1.h-1 bombesin; and from 158 +/- 29 to 83.4 +/- 10 following 200 pmol.kg-1.h-1 bombesin: P = 0.01 for each). Antimicrobial therapy had no effect on gastrin release in uninfected volunteers, thus excluding a nonspecific effect of antimicrobial therapy on antral G-cell function. Serum gastrin was also not increased by feeding 500 mg of urea to 5 H. pylori-infected volunteers. This suggests that access of hydrogen ion to the pH-sensitive sites governing gastrin release by mucosal ammonia produced by H. pylori urease is not a critical factor. These data suggest that exaggerated gastrin release present in patients with duodenal ulcer disease is secondary to H. pylori infection. \nInterleukin-1 mRNA-expressing macrophages in human chronically inflamed gingival tissues. Interleukin-1 (IL-1)-producing cells in inflamed gingival tissues obtained from patients with periodontitis were examined by combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Macrophages, T cells, B cells, and endothelial cells were visualized in the lesions by the immunoperoxidase method using specific antibodies to each cell type. Subsequent in situ hybridization using 35S-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide probes complementary to human IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA showed IL-1 transcripts in macrophages predominantly but not in T cells or B cells. Neither fibroblasts nor keratinocytes contained the IL-1 message to any significant extent. Endothelial cells also were essentially negative for IL-1 messages. These findings indicate that IL-1 is produced principally by macrophages in inflamed gingival tissues of humans. \nCurrent management, local management, and survival statistics of high-grade osteosarcoma. Experience in Japan. To report the current management of high-grade osteosarcoma in Japan, the authors studied the results of 55 cases treated in the authors' institutions and data provided by Osaka University (59 cases), Chiba Oncology Group (97), and Sapporo National Hospital (70). Twenty-five of the 55 cases in the authors' series were treated by limb-salvage surgery, 27 by amputation, and the remainder by chemotherapy. In all 226 cases from the three institutes, 106 were treated by amputation and 120 by limb-salvage surgery. Two local recurrences (4%) were found in the authors' series, three in the Osaka series, and eight in the Chiba series. Five-year accumulative survival rates in this study showed some differences, depending upon the institution or upon the protocol employed: in the authors' series it was 60% overall and 68% for a stronger chemotherapy group; in the Osaka series, it was 50% in a mild chemotherapy group and 72% in an intensive chemotherapy group; and in the Sapporo series, it was 36% and 73%, respectively. This study showed that local control of IIB osteosarcoma was successfully achieved by preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and wide resection, and that an intensive chemotherapeutic combination of high-dose methotrexate, cisplatinum, and doxorubicin is promising. \nNocardial meningitis: case reports and review. Twenty-eight episodes of nocardial central nervous system infection fulfilling criteria for meningitis were reviewed. In 21 cases Nocardia was cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Associated predisposing conditions were present in 75% of cases. The typical presentation was subacute to chronic meningitis characterized by fever (68%), stiff neck (64%), and headache (55%). CSF studies revealed neutrophilic pleocytosis (83% of cases, greater than 500 white blood cells/mm3), hypoglycorrhachia (64%, less than 40 mg of glucose/dL), and elevated protein level (61%, greater than 100 mg/dL). In 43% of cases there was an associated brain abscess. Patients with brain abscess had more frequent and severe aberrations in mental status as well as higher initial white blood cell counts in CSF. Mortality was 52% for the 23 cases diagnosed antemortem and 57% overall. Compared with patients who died, survivors were younger, had lower initial CSF glucose levels, and were less likely to have brain abscess. Diagnosis was often delayed, and nocardial infection was rarely suspected before positive culture reports or autopsy findings became available. \nThe influence of severity of spinal cord ischemia in the etiology of delayed-onset paraplegia. To clarify the cause of delayed-onset paraplegia, the authors evaluated the neurologic outcome after temporary (10 to 30 minutes) spinal cord ischemia in the awake rabbit. Loss of motor function occurred in less than 2 minutes in all animals. Restoration of flow within 16 minutes always resulted in full return of function, whereas with occlusion times of greater than 27 minutes all animals remained paralyzed. After temporary occlusion of 20 to 21 minutes, however, 71% of animals returned to normal neurologic function but developed delayed-onset paraplegia 14 to 48 hours later. This appears to be a reliable method for the creation of a model of delayed-onset paraplegia in the awake animal, and will facilitate more detailed studies of the pathophysiology of ischemia-induced paraplegia. \nMassive hemorrhage from a ruptured enteric varices of an augmented bladder. Intestinal varices are uncommon and usually occur secondary to portal hypertension. We report a case of variceal rupture in the intestinal segment of an augmentation colocystoplasty. The patient presented in shock from exsanguinating hemorrhage per urethram, and diagnosis was established at laparotomy. Although the bleeding was controlled with excision of the involved intestinal segment, the patient died of multiple organ failure. The diagnosis and treatment of this rare but fatal condition are discussed. \nFatal aortic rupture during balloon dilatation of recoarctation. In an eight year old boy with a patch aortoplasty, the aorta ruptured during balloon angioplasty for recoarctation. At necropsy a 1.5 cm long, full thickness tear and a separate, smaller, intimal tear were found. Histological examination showed thinning of the elastic laminae of the aorta. Angioplasty for recoarctation may be dangerous in patients with a patch aortoplasty. \nInvestigations on the biochemical characteristics of chronically underperfused muscle. During operation, biopsies from the gastrocnemius muscle and, in some cases, from the sartorius muscle were taken from 32 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease and from 5 subjects with normal peripheral circulation. In patients with inadequate circulation only during exercise, when compared with the control group, increased activities of enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism (malate dehydrogenase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome C oxidase, creatine kinase), in amino acid metabolism (asparate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase), and in anaerobic glycoysis (lactate dehydrogenase) were found. In patients with circulatory disturbances that manifested themselves already at rest, enzyme activities were, with the exception of LDH, lower than those of patients with exclusively exercise-related insufficiency. By means of intraindividual comparisons with the corresponding enzyme activities in the sartorius muscle, the author was able to show that the changes found were not simply the result of differences in training conditions. The diminished concentrations of energy-rich phosphate are an expression of the anaerobic metabolic state in patients with inadequate circulation at rest. It is concluded that chronic ischemia of muscle leads to changes in the energy metabolism of the cell. In the presence of more nearly adequate circulation at rest, the portion of oxidative potential of the total energy metabolism increases. In contrast, if there is an inadequate circulation at rest, the mainly anaerobic glycolysis becomes quantitatively predominant. \nAcute pulmonary embolism in pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation. Acute pulmonary embolism with infarction can delay urgently needed heart transplantation and increase the postoperative pulmonary complications. Few data are available concerning pulmonary embolization in the pediatric patient with end-stage congestive heart failure. Sixty-two consecutive pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation were monitored for evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. Acute pulmonary infarction was documented by ventilation-perfusion scan, pulmonary angiography or pathologic examination in six patients. The prevalence differed by diagnosis; 5 of 36 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 of 20 patients with congenital heart disease developed acute pulmonary embolism with infarction. No significant difference in age at the time of transplantation evaluation, duration of congestive heart failure, presence of cardiac arrhythmias or degree of cardiac dysfunction was seen between patients with and without pulmonary embolism. Two-dimensional echocardiography failed to detect the presence of an intracardiac thrombus in four of the six patients. Two patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction are alive after successful heart transplantation. The remaining four patients died within 6 weeks of initiation of anticoagulant therapy before transplantation could safely be performed. In summary, pediatric patients with end-stage congestive heart failure are at risk for acute pulmonary embolism. No specific clinical factor identified those patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction. Anticoagulant therapy is strongly recommended in the pediatric patient with poor ventricular function awaiting heart transplantation. \nReliability of interviewer and subject assessments of nevus counts in a study of melanoma. Several types of data are presented concerning the reliability of counting or estimating the density of nevi (moles), a major risk factor for melanoma, using methods typically employed in epidemiologic studies. First, interviewer-derived counts of nevi on the arm produced estimates of inter-observer, inter-subject, temporal and random variability, and their interactions. Second, interviewer-derived arm counts and respondent self-reports of whole body nevus density were compared. Finally, we compared male and female cases and controls with respect to their reported rates of having a relative with a malignant mole. Overall, the intra-observer reliability ranged from 55 to 81%, and was better for observers with more experience. The correlation between the interviewer counts and respondents' self-reported estimates was 0.41. The data on malignant moles in relatives suggest higher reporting rates in male cases and lower reporting in male controls relative to their female counterparts, but there is little difference by sex in the reporting of one's own nevus density. \nThe unstable ST segment early after thrombolysis for acute infarction and its usefulness as a marker of recurrent coronary occlusion. To investigate the incidence of early recurrent ST elevation after intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, 12-lead electrocardiograms were continuously monitored for 571 +/- 326 minutes in 31 patients presenting within 4 hours of symptom onset. The study group comprised 9 women and 22 men (mean age +/- standard deviation 53 +/- 12 years), with ST elevation (anterior in 15, inferior in 16) on the initial electrocardiogram, who were given either tissue plasminogen activator (22 patients) or streptokinase (9 patients). Angiography was performed in 30 of 31 patients at 7 to 10 days. Early (less than 3 hours) resolution of ST elevation occurred in 19 patients (61%) at a median of 94 minutes (interquartile range 57 to 113) after thrombolysis, whereas 12 (39%) had no or late (greater than 6 hours) resolution. Eleven of the 19 with early resolution (58%) had either transient (5 patients) or sustained (6 patients) recurrences of ST elevation. Recurrent ST elevation was equal to or more than the initial peak elevation in 9 of 11 patients, and greater than 75% of initial peak in 2. A total of 25 episodes of recurrent ST elevation were observed in the 11 patients (19 transient and 6 sustained episodes), of which 8 (32%) were silent. The proportion of silent episodes was similar for transient (35%) and sustained (33%) recurrences. All patients with sustained recurrent ST elevation had at least 1 preceding transient recurrence. The median duration of transient recurrent ST elevation was 43 minutes (28 to 63). \nOn lowering lipids in the post-infarction patient. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) elevated serum cholesterol levels, like other classical risk factors, remain predictive of further coronary events. The excess risk attributable to raised cholesterol levels is considerable, and greater than that in subjects without CHD. A recent meta-analysis of all eight qualifying trials of secondary prevention of CHD by cholesterol lowering is reviewed. There were significant reductions in recurrent non-fatal and fatal CHD, with a downward trend in total mortality. Mechanisms underlying the relationship between cholesterol lowering and secondary prevention are reviewed. The implication of this analysis of trials for clinical practice is that hypercholesterolaemia should be sought and effectively treated in patients with CHD, unless contraindications are present. \nIncreasing use of soyfoods and their potential role in cancer prevention. The United States produces approximately half of the world's soybeans. Although most of what is produced is used as animal feed, soy-protein products (eg, soy-protein flour, concentrates, and isolates) are used extensively by the food industry, primarily for their functional characteristics, such as emulsification. During the past decade, however, there has been a marked increase in the use of both traditional soyfoods, such as tofu and soymilk, and second-generation soyfoods, products which generally simulate familiar American dishes. Recently, attention has focused on the possible role of soybean consumption in reducing cancer risk. Soybeans contain, in relatively high concentrations, several compounds with demonstrated anticarcinogenic activity. Two of these compounds--protease inhibitors and phytic acid--have traditionally been viewed as antinutrients. The scientific community has begun to appreciate the potential importance of nonnutritive dietary compounds (phytochemicals) in foods such as soybeans. Dietitians need to become more aware of the phytochemical content of foods and the possible effect of phytochemicals on health and disease. \nThe low-affinity p75 nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor mediates NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a potential mechanism for initial signaling in PC12 cells during differentiation in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation has been found to be initiated by the trk protooncogene, which participates in the formation of high-affinity NGF binding sites. In contrast to transfection of wild-type low-affinity p75 NGF receptors, transfection of p75NGFR with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain resulted in an inability of NGF to elicit tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates, indicating that p75NGFR is involved in initiating phosphorylation events by NGF. Even though the p75NGFR receptor does not possess any inherent tyrosine kinase activity, these experiments demonstrate that the p75NGFR has a potential role in NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. \nRenal calculi in lower pole calices: what is the best method of treatment? Percutaneous nephrolithotomy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) can be used in the treatment of lower pole caliceal calculi. In a retrospective analysis these 2 therapies were compared for treatment of solitary lower pole caliceal calculi to evaluate morbidity. During a 2-year period 23 patients treated with percutaneous nephrolithotomy and 24 who underwent ESWL with the Siemens Lithostar were analyzed in regard to the success rate, effectiveness quotient, complication rate, length of hospitalization and disability period. Followup consisted of ultrasound and/or a plain film of the kidneys, ureters and bladder 1 day and 1 to 3 months postoperatively. A nephrotomogram was included in the ESWL group. Complete removal of all stone fragments was achieved in 93.6% of the patients treated percutaneously without retreatment. In the ESWL group the success rate was 79.2% with a 41.6% retreatment rate. On the other hand, the ESWL group had a shorter hospitalization and an earlier return to normal physical activities. Among the patients who underwent a percutaneous operation 13% had complications compared to 4.1% in the ESWL group. The recurrence rate was higher in the former group (13% within a median of 18 months, compared to 8.3% within a median of 11 months in the ESWL group). The mean stone diameter was 1.42 cm. in the percutaneous group and 1.22 cm. in the ESWL group. Stone composition was similar in both groups. Since ESWL is an effective noninvasive procedure without the need for routine anesthesia and hospitalization, and with prompt return of the patient to a normal life it must be considered the method of choice for lower caliceal stones less than 2 cm. in diameter. However, percutaneous nephrolithotomy will continue to have a primary role in the management of larger stones. \nBiliary surgery after cardiac transplantation. Many patients have undergone successful cardiac transplantation. These patients are at risk of developing the same surgical diseases as the general population. The side effects of immunotherapy may mandate intervention at a different point in the natural history of these processes. From February 1984 through December 1989, 24 patients underwent an operative biliary tract procedure following cardiac transplantation. Seventeen patients underwent elective cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography. The mean hospital stay was 5.4 days, and there was no morbidity or mortality. Seven patients underwent urgent procedures; four of them developed severe complications and three died as a result of their biliary tract disease. Two patients in the urgent group had previously exhibited symptoms of biliary tract disease, and five were previously asymptomatic. There was no significant difference in time from transplantation to biliary procedure between the elective group (mean, 17 months; range, 3 weeks to 47 months) and the urgent group (mean, 18 months; range, 3 weeks to 44 months). Patients who undergo cardiac transplantation should be screened for cholelithiasis. The presence of symptoms should not be required before recommending operative intervention. \nPostoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia. A technique for relief of postoperative pain following major extremity surgery. A new technique using postoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia (PICRA) for postoperative pain relief was investigated in 23 surgical patients treated by amputation (12 patients) or by limb-salvage resection operations (11 patients). Bupivacaine was delivered into peripheral nerve sheaths via catheters placed therein at the time of surgery. Only patients in whom the nerves were easily accessible were treated. Catheters were placed in the axillary sheath, the lumbosacral trunk, and the femoral nerve sheaths of patients treated with shoulder girdle and pelvic procedures (resections and amputations), and within the sciatic nerve sheath of those treated with lower extremity procedures. The anesthetic agent was delivered at controllable rates. Regional analgesia was obtained in the operative site with minimal motor or sensory decrease. To assess the efficacy of this technique, the results of this study group were compared with those of a matched group of 11 patients treated with similar surgical procedures but who received epidural morphine. Eleven of the 23 patients on PICRA required no supplemental narcotic agents. The mean level of the narcotic agents required by the remaining 13 PICRA patients was approximately one third of that required by the matched group of 11 patients receiving epidural morphine. Overall, the patients on PICRA had an 80% reduction of narcotic requirements when compared to the historical controls. The technique is reliable and can be performed by the surgeon, requiring about a ten-minute increase in operating time. It has potentially wide application in orthopedics in procedures in which the major nerves are easily accessible (e.g., pelvic fractures and revision hip surgery) and for patients with intractable pain of the extremities. \nLambda-like and V pre-B genes expression: an early B-lineage marker of human leukemias. V pre-B and lambda-like genes are selectively expressed in human pre-B cells and encode polypeptide chains that associate in a mu-pseudolight chain complex that may regulate some crucial steps of early B-cell differentiation. We have followed by polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis the expression of these \"pre-B-specific\" genes in correlation with the status (rearranged v germline) of Ig gene loci (H, kappa, lambda) in a panel of 32 leukemias pertaining mostly to the B lineage and including a number of ambiguously characterized samples. All cells that had rearranged the H locus only expressed V pre-B and lambda-like transcripts, in agreement with a pre-B status. In this group, some biphenotypic leukemias (mostly My/B) might, in fact, be already engaged in the B lineage. Rearrangement of V kappa or V lambda loci correlated with the disappearance of the pre-B gene products. In a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line that was induced to mature to the B-cell stage in culture upon kappa gene rearrangement, the mu-pseudolight chain complex was actually replaced by the classical mu-kappa molecule. Finally, V pre-B and lambda-like genes were found expressed in two leukemic cells that had retained all Ig loci in germline configuration. This finding raises the possibility of having an early pro-B progenitor in which V pre-B and lambda-like products associate with a H chain surrogate in a complex that would trigger an early event of B-cell differentiation such as the H locus rearrangements. \nErythroderma, palmoplantar keratoderma and profound failure to thrive in an infant. The case is reported of a female infant, who at the age of 3 months developed severe erythroderma, marked hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles and subsequently extreme growth failure and intermittent diarrhoea. Her course was complicated by life-threatening infections but detailed investigation revealed no recognized underlying metabolic or immune abnormality. \nRole of interstitial therapy in the treatment of liver cancer. Conventional palliative management of inoperable focal hepatic tumours remains unsatisfactory. Interstitial techniques such as cryotherapy, alcohol injection, low power laser hyperthermia and interstitial radiotherapy offer alternative approaches. Cryotherapy is an effective and precise technique for inducing tumour necrosis. It can only be performed at laparotomy making it relatively invasive and retreatment impractical. Alcohol is cheap and can be injected percutaneously. However, inhomogeneous distribution produces imprecise and nonreproducible lesions. Low power laser hyperthermia produces precise and reproducible areas of necrosis that are roughly spherical in shape. At present, this technique is most effective for small tumours. Interstitial radiotherapy remains the least evaluated of all the interstitial techniques. Unlike cryotherapy and low power laser hyperthermia, the biological effect of ethanol injection and interstitial radiotherapy cannot be monitored in real time by ultrasound. With the exception of cryotherapy, all methods can be applied percutaneously with low morbidity and mortality. None of these techniques is established, but they may offer the prospect of cure in cases where all areas of tumour can be positively identified and fully treated. However, in most instances the intention is to control the growth of relatively small discrete volumes of tumour within the hepatic parenchyma. \nMiddle ear fluid lysozyme source in experimental pneumococcal otitis media. Middle ear infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae is important in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic otitis media, and lysozyme in middle ear fluid (MEF) is an important inflammatory mediator in this disease. To determine the source of lysozyme during the early period of acute pneumococcal otitis media, chinchillas were irradiated to induce neutropenia, and their middle ears were inoculated with heat-killed, encapsulated pneumococci. The number of inflammatory cells and concentration of lysozyme were measured in MEF between 6 and 72 hours after inoculation. In pneumococcus-inoculated ears, the mean number of inflammatory cells but not lysozyme was significantly lower in MEF from irradiated animals than that from nonirradiated animals at 6 hours. Since lysozyme accumulated in MEF before the influx of inflammatory cells in irradiated animals, the initial release of this inflammatory mediator is most likely not from inflammatory cells; and mucosal epithelial cells, the only other known source of lysozyme in the middle ear environment, were the probable source induced by the direct stimulation of pneumococci. Inflammatory cells may contribute lysozyme later in the inflammatory response, since cellular and lysozyme concentrations in irradiated and nonirradiated animals were similar between 24 and 72 hours. These results suggest that future therapeutic interventions to limit middle ear inflammation in acute otitis media may need to recognize the direct action of pneumococcal cells or their envelope components on middle ear epithelium. \nOperative management of acoustic neuromas: the priority of neurologic function over complete resection. The objective of surgical management of acoustic tumors is to remove them entirely and preserve facial nerve function and hearing when possible. A dilemma arises when it is not possible to remove the entire tumor without incurring additional neurologic deficits. Twenty patients who underwent intentional incomplete surgical removal of an acoustic neuroma to avoid further neurologic deficit were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into a subtotal group (resection of less than 95% of tumor) and a near-total group (resection of 95% or more of tumor) and were followed yearly with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The subtotal group was planned and consisted of elderly patients (mean age, 68.5 years) with large tumors (mean, 3.1 cm). The near-total group consisted of younger patients (mean age, 45.8 years) and smaller tumors (mean, 2.3 cm). The mean length of followup for all patients was 5.0 years. Ninety percent of patients had House grade I or II facial function post-operatively. Radiologically detectable tumor regrowth occurred in only one patient, who was in the subtotal resection group. Near-total resection of acoustic tumor was not associated with radiologic evidence of regrowth of tumor for the period of observation. Within the limits of the follow-up period of this study, subtotal resection of acoustic neuroma in elderly patients was not associated with clinically significant recurrence in most patients and produced highly satisfactory rates of facial preservation with low surgical morbidity. \nThe role of albumin in human physiology and pathophysiology, Part III: Albumin and disease states. The serum albumin level is one of several clinical parameters of the status of general health. There is a marked correlation between low albumin levels and the incidence of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that hypoalbuminemia is a common finding among hospitalized patients. This results from alterations in the catabolic or anabolic rates, losses of albumin, or redistribution between the various fluid compartments of the body. Somewhat less well defined than the role of albumin as a prognostic indicator is its role in compounding pathophysiology. Hypoalbuminemia is known to be associated with delayed wound healing. The hypoalbuminemic state interferes with the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. Qualitative changes in the albumin molecule which occur in renal disease may damage the nephron. Low serum albumin levels may adversely affect the coagulation system. Further investigation into the role of albumin in pathophysiology is warranted. \nDifferentiation between renal allograft rejection and cyclosporine toxicity: a clinicopathological study. The differentiation between cyclosporine nephrotoxicity (CyN) and acute rejection (AR) still remains a matter of intensive research. In a retrospective study over the last 2 years, we assessed the clinical and histopathological data of 43 episodes of renal dysfunction in 39 renal transplant recipients immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (CyA). Ten episodes (23.2%) were identified as AR and 10 (23.2%) as acute CyN; in six cases (13.9%), signs of both AR and CyN were found. Fever (80%), oliguria (50%), and edema (50%) were prominent features in AR, but not in CyN. Renal blood flow was higher in the nephrotoxicity group and for corresponding degree of renal dysfunction. Significant hyperuricemia (greater than 8 mg/dL) was a prominent finding in CyN (80%) and to a lesser extent in AR (20%). The helper to suppressor cell ratio in the peripheral blood remained stable or slightly decreased in all cases with CyN, but increased in 70% of the cases with AR. CyN was associated with significantly higher whole blood CyA levels (P less than 0.005) and there was a positive correlation between plasma creatinine and CyA levels during the nephrotoxicity episodes (P less than 0.02). Diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrate was observed in 90% of the biopsies with AR and only in 20% with CyN (P less than 0.005). Concerning the extent of the tubular lesions, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. In contrast, vascular lesions such as arterial endothelial proliferation (P less than 0.05), hyalinosis (P less than 0.05), and glomerular capillary thrombi (P less than 0.05) were more commonly seen in nephrotoxicity biopsies. \nThe paradox of 'chronic unstable angina' secondary to an organizing intracoronary thrombus [published erratum appears in South Med J 1991 Sep;84(9):1074, 1160] We have described a case in which coronary vasospasm and the resultant endothelial shear stresses most likely caused plaque rupture and transient coronary occlusion at the site of a minor atherosclerotic narrowing. Remodeling then led to a long, complex stenotic lesion that included ruptured and dissected endothelium and organized thrombus. This led to severe anginal symptoms over a 3-month period, or the paradox of \"chronic unstable angina.\" Angioplasty was difficult but eventually successful after pulsed high-pressure balloon inflations and intracoronary thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase. This case demonstrates that the clinical course of a patient with minor or insignificant coronary disease may be a dynamic process that cannot be entirely predicted even by recent invasive cardiac studies. \nLhermitte-Duclos disease and Cowden disease: a single phakomatosis. Two unrelated patients with macrocephaly, seizures, and mild cerebellar signs had a dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum (Lhermitte-Duclos disease). Both also had autosomal dominant Cowden disease as evidenced by facial, oral, and acral papules. In the two families, 9 sibs demonstrated the mucocutaneous lesions, thyroid disease, breast tumors, and ovarian tumors compatible with the diagnosis of Cowden disease. Some of the sibs also showed various degrees of neurological signs such as macrocephaly, mental retardation, seizures, tremor, and dysdiadochokinesia. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of sibs of one family demonstrated megalencephaly and other mild abnormalities. The occurrence of these two rare disorders in single patients is more than a coincidence, and the clinical findings in the combined condition establishes it as a new phakomatosis. \nEndothelin effects on renal function and tubuloglomerular feedback. Analysis of our data in conjunction with other recent literature allows the following conclusions regarding the role of endothelin in the tubuloglomerular feedback control mechanism and in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic renal failure: (1) Endothelin reduces nephron filtration rate in the nephrons with interrupted signal perception at the macula densa, in accord with preglomerular arteriolar constriction. Yet, the increase in filtration fraction in the whole kidney clearance study suggests a preferential postglomerular arteriolar constriction. Taken together, endothelin, which is a very potent renal vasoconstrictor, seems to constrict both preglomerular and postglomerular arterioles with a predominant constriction of the latter at the doses employed. (2) The endothelin-induced natriuresis is due to a fall in tubular reabsorption, reflecting a direct tubular action, possibly related to an elevation in blood pressure. (3) At the doses of endothelin used and under the present experimental conditions, changes in the magnitude of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response or the feedback characteristic could not be detected. (4) No evidence was found for a participation of endothelin in the pathogenesis of acute postischemic renal failure, as evidenced by the absence of an improvement in glomerular filtration after treatment with endothelin antiserum. \nIdiopathic photoreceptor dysfunction causes unexplained visual acuity loss in later adulthood. Progressive visual loss, caused by initially unrecognized retinal photoreceptor dysfunction predominantly affecting cones, developed in six patients in late adulthood. Because of minimal ophthalmoscopic retinal abnormalities, the patients initially had been suspected of having optic neuropathy or psychogenic visual loss. The correct diagnosis was ultimately established by finding electroretinographic abnormalities and color discrimination losses out of proportion to visual acuity loss. In no case was a causative agent or a family history of photoreceptor disease identified. In many other respects, however, features of the patients' illness resemble those described previously under the headings of cone dysfunction syndrome, cone dystrophy, cone degeneration, and cone-rod dystrophy. \nVolvulus of the splenic flexure: radiographic features. Six cases of splenic flexure volvulus were studied over a 14-year period. The patients were aged 15-62 years. Five of the six patients were mentally retarded, lifelong residents of a long-term-care institution. Two patients had congenital absence of normal colonic attachments; the other four patients had elongated mesocolons, presumably from chronic constipation. All patients underwent abdominal radiography, followed by a barium enema study. In the appropriate clinical setting, radiographic diagnosis of a splenic flexure volvulus is suggested when the following are seen: (a) a markedly dilated, air-filled colon wtih an abrupt termination at the anatomic splenic flexure; (b) two widely separated air-fluid levels, one in the transverse colon and the other in the cecum; (c) an empty descending and sigmoid colon; and (d) a characteristic beak at the anatomic splenic flexure at a barium enema examination. \nResults of surgical therapy for biliary dyskinesia. One hundred eighty-seven patients who presented with symptoms consistent with biliary colic but had no ultrasonic evidence of cholelithiasis were observed in an effort to identify those with a functional gallbladder disorder that might benefit from surgical intervention. All patients underwent quantitative evaluation of gallbladder emptying using cholecystokinin biliary scanning, and ejection fractions less than 35% were considered abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients (69%) had abnormal ejection fractions, and 88 (68%) of these subsequently underwent cholecystectomy. Sixty of the surgical specimens revealed pathologic changes. Eighty-four percent of patients successfully contacted for follow-up experienced complete relief, and another 13% had partial relief of preoperative symptoms. Only two patients reported no change in symptom complex. Twenty-nine patients with abnormal ejection fractions elected not to undergo surgery. Fifty-nine percent of these patients continued to experience symptoms of biliary colic at a mean follow-up of 22 months. Of the 44 patients with normal ejection fractions, 35 (80%) reported resolution of symptoms during follow-up of medical treatment. Cholecystokinin biliary scanning can help identify patients with acalculous, functional gallbladder disease who may benefit from cholecystectomy. \nImpedance cardiography for repeated determination of stroke volume in elderly hypertensives: correlation with pulsed Doppler echocardiography. In this double-blind, crossover study the authors have validated stroke volume determination by impedance cardiography against the pulsed Doppler echocardiographic method in elderly hypertensives. They found a good correlation between the stroke volume values obtained by the two methods over a range of values from 30 to 130 mL. The coefficient of linear regression was about .95 at each visit. The mean of the differences was -0.73 mL with a standard deviation of 8.46. Given that individual differences are normally distributed, the values corresponding to 2 standard deviations of the mean define a range covering 95% of the observed differences. From the distribution of the data around the mean plot it appears that, in comparison with pulsed Doppler, impedance cardiography tends to slightly underestimate stroke volumes of greater than 90 mL and to overestimate values of less than 50 mL. The results of this study indicate that impedance cardiography may represent a reliable alternative to pulsed Doppler echocardiography for the noninvasive estimation of cardiac output at rest in elderly patients. \nTricuspid annular motion. Triscupid annular motion is related to right ventricular systolic function in the same way mitral annulus motion is related to left ventricular function. Tricuspid annular excursion reflects the longitudinal motion of the right ventricle, and the systolic descent of the anulus correlates with systolic venous inflow to the right atrium. However, it has not been shown clearly how to reproducibly quantify this motion. Therefore we describe a method to measure triscuspid annular motion using two-dimensional oriented M-mode echocardiography from the apical view. We studied a group of 10 normal subjects (mean age, 28.7 years; range, 25 to 38 years) and a group of 29 patients (mean age, 57.2 years; range, 20 to 84 years) with disease of the left side of the heart but no evidence of involvement of the right side of the heart. In each subject, tricuspid and mitral annular motion were measured respectively at their lateral, septal or medial, anterior, and posterior margin points. The total tricuspid annular motion for normal subjects was, as follows: lateral, 24.9 +/- 3.5 mm; medial, 20.1 +/- 2.5 mm; anterior, 21.6 +/- 3.8 mm; and posterior, 22.3 +/- 2.3 mm. Interobserver and intraobserver variability was low, with a coefficient of variance for the different annular points ranging from 6.19% to 11.56% between observers and from 4.10% to 7.26% within observer. We conclude that it is possible to measure tricuspid annular motion with this method in a reproducible way and to use it as a diagnostic tool in evaluating function of the right side of the heart. \nMelanosis coli: a case report in a trauma patient and review of the literature. Melanosis Coli (MC) is a benign pigmentation disorder of the colon occasionally diagnosed at endoscopy. The authors report a case of M. coli in a patient with a gunshot to the abdomen, in whom the entity produced an interesting clinical picture, and a review of the literature on this condition. \nAsymptomatic myocardial ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and importance of prior Q-wave infarction and diabetes mellitus. Eighty-eight patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of 100 stenoses were studied for the presence of factors deemed significant in the etiology of silent myocardial ischemia. Thirty-two patients were asymptomatic during balloon dilations of 36 arteries, and 56 patients had angina during PTCA of 64 arteries. There were no differences in age, sex, prior anginal history, antianginal regimen, extent of coronary artery disease and number or duration of inflations between the 2 study groups. Previous infarction (33 vs 12%, p less than 0.02), Q waves in the target area (31 vs 7%, p less than 0.005) and diabetes mellitus (36 vs 17%, p less than 0.05) were present more often in the asymptomatic group. Sixty-four% of all asymptomatic patients had either diabetes or previous infarction in the target territory. Collateral circulation was more frequent in asymptomatic patients, probably reflecting the ability of collateral arteries to ameliorate ischemia. During 2-vessel PTCA, patients without angina during dilation of only 1 of the 2 treated arteries (discordant responders) had previous infarction in that artery's territory (5 of 5, 100%), whereas patients without previous infarction were either symptomatic or asymptomatic (concordant responders) during PTCA of both arteries. This study shows that asymptomatic ischemia occurs frequently during PTCA in patients with symptomatic coronary disease. Prior Q-wave infarction and diabetes mellitus are important, independent factors associated with painless ischemia. It is suggested that infarction produces a localized dysfunction of afferent cardiac pain fibers, whereas diabetes can cause a global cardiac sensory neuropathy. \nExpanded clinical evaluation of lovastatin (EXCEL) study results: IV. Additional perspectives on the tolerability of lovastatin. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter, diet-and-placebo-controlled study was designed to clarify the dose-response relationship of lovastatin therapy to lipid-modifying efficacy and drug-related adverse events. Exclusion criteria were minimized so that study patients were representative of the majority of patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia seen in medical practice. After 6 weeks on the American Heart Association Step 1 Diet, a total of 8,245 patients were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of treatment with diet and placebo or lovastatin at dosages of 20 or 40 mg once a day or 20 or 40 mg twice a day. All adverse events were monitored, with particular attention to evaluation of liver and muscle. Liver transaminase elevations suggestive of possible hepatotoxicity, defined as successive elevations in either aspartate transaminase or alanine aminotransferase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, occurred in equal numbers of placebo and lovastatin 20 mg/day treated patients (0.1%). The frequencies were higher in lovastatin 40 mg/day and 80 mg/day patient groups (0.9 and 1.5%, respectively). No patient was diagnosed as having clinically symptomatic hepatic dysfunction. Creatinine kinase (CK) elevations above the upper limit of normal occurred frequently in placebo- (29%), as well as lovastatin-treated patients (29-35%), and muscle symptoms were reported with similar frequency in all groups (7-9%). The combination of muscle symptoms with marked CK elevations (greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) was seen in only five patients: one in a 40 mg/day dose group and four in the 80 mg/day dose group. No patient developed rhabdomyolysis. The incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events requiring discontinuation was 6% for the placebo group and from 7% (20 mg/day) to 9% (80 mg/day) for lovastatin treatment groups. No new types of adverse experiences related to lovastatin treatment were reported. Lovastatin, as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated LDL cholesterol, was generally very well tolerated. \nCis-platinum chemotherapy for ocular basal cell carcinoma. We have used intravenous cis-platinum chemotherapy in the treatment of three patients with basal cell carcinoma of the lid extending into the orbit. Cis-platinum chemotherapy caused a reduction in tumour size and thereby delayed surgery in all cases. It allowed for local resection in one case, appeared to delay a patient's exenteration in a second case, and was used prior to radiotherapy in a third case. While not curative, cis-platinum may be useful as an adjuvant to decrease tumour mass prior to local excision and for patients who refuse or must delay exenteration. \nPercutaneous radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular arrhythmias in children. Nineteen procedures were performed in 17 children, aged 10 months to 17 years, using catheter radiofrequency applications for the management of malignant or drug-resistant supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Diagnoses were junctional ectopic tachycardia in 1 patient, atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia in 4 and accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia in 12. Accessory pathway locations were left lateral (n = 4), posteroseptal (n = 3), left posterior (n = 2), right posterolateral (n = 1), right posterior paraseptal (n = 1), right intermediate septal (n = 1) and right anterior (n = 1). Ablation of accessory pathways was performed using 20 to 40 W of energy. The catheter was passed retrograde to the left ventricle in patients with a left-sided pathway and anterograde to the right atrium in those with a right-sided or posteroseptal pathway. In the 12 patients with an accessory pathway, radiofrequency applications were successful in 11 pathways and failed in 2. There were no recurrences of accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia. Atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia was treated by AV node modification using 15 W of energy applied until first degree AV block occurred. After radiofrequency catheter ablation, there was a prolonged AH interval, tachycardia was not inducible and tachycardia recurred in one patient. For the patient with junctional ectopic tachycardia, 15 to 18 W of energy was delivered at the site of the maximal His bundle electrogram until sinus rhythm and normal AV conduction appeared. After a recurrence, a second procedure abolished tachycardia and AV conduction. In summary, radiofrequency catheter ablation was initially successful in 17 of 19 procedures and ultimately curative in 14 (82%) of 17 patients with no serious complications. Radiofrequency catheter ablation appears to be a safe and effective method for the management of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children. \nThe heterogeneity of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). I. Characterization of peptide heterogeneity in 13 individual preparations of hCG. Peptide variations in the alpha-subunit (molecules starting at alpha 3 and alpha 4) and beta-subunit (missing linkages at beta 44-45 and beta 47-48) of hCG have been reported by several investigators. Studies, however, have been limited to standard hCG preparations (purified from large pools of urine) and other hCG samples from mixed urines. In this study we used chromatographic procedures to purify the total hCG content of 13 individual urines, 6 from patients with pregnancy and 7 from those with trophoblast disease (no hCG-containing fractions were excluded). Then, we examined for the first time the peptide variability among individual samples of hCG. We report 1) that individual hCG preparations have nicks (missing linkages) in the beta-subunit, primarily between residue 47-48 (11 of 13 samples) and, less commonly, at the linkage 44-45 or 46-47 (3 of 13 samples); 2) the extent of nicking varies greatly between individual preparations (range, 0-100% of molecules); 3) varying alpha-subunit N-terminal heterogeneity (N-terminus starting at alpha 3 or alpha 4) was also present (range, 0-28% of molecules), but was confined to preparations from individuals with trophoblast disease (6 of 7 samples from trophoblast disease urine, 0 of 6 from pregnancy urine); 4) hCG missing the beta-subunit C-terminal region was also detected (2 of 13 hCG preparations); and 5) 1 of 13 preparations was nicked on the hCG alpha-subunit, between residues 70 and 71. Thus, 12 of 13 individual hCG samples demonstrated at least 1 of 4 different forms of peptide heterogeneity. We conclude that individual hCG samples vary widely in the type and extent of peptide heterogeneity, an observation that is not appreciated when pools of hCG are studied. \nRole of cardiac ATP-regulated potassium channels in differential responses of endocardial and epicardial cells to ischemia. Epicardial cells are more susceptible to the electrophysiological effects of ischemia than are endocardial cells. To explore the ionic basis for the differential electrophysiological responses to ischemia at the two sites, we used patch-clamp techniques to study the effects of ATP depletion on action potential duration and the ability of ATP-regulated K+ channels in single cells isolated from feline left ventricular endocardial and epicardial surfaces. During ATP depletion by treatment with 1 mM cyanide (CN-), shortening of action potential durations was significantly greater in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. Thirty minutes after initiating exposure to 1 mM CN-, action potential duration at 90% repolarization was reduced to 0.70 +/- 0.12 of the control value for endocardial cells versus 0.39 +/- 0.18 for epicardial cells (p less than 0.01), and action potential duration at 20% repolarization was reduced to 0.72 +/- 0.13 for endocardial cells versus 0.12 +/- 0.09 for epicardial cells (p less than 0.01). In both endocardial and epicardial cells, the shortening of action potential by CN- treatment was partially reversed by 0.3 microM glibenclamide; the magnitude of reversal, however, was much greater in epicardial cells. After exposure to 1 mM CN-, the activity of ATP-regulated K+ channels in cell-attached membrane patches was significantly greater in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. To study the dose-response relation between ATP concentration and open-state probability of the channels, intracellular surfaces of inside-out membrane patches containing ATP-regulated K+ channels were exposed to various concentrations of ATP (10-1,000 microM). The concentration of ATP that produced half-maximal inhibition of the channel was 23.6 +/- 21.9 microM in endocardial cells and 97.6 +/- 48.1 microM in epicardial cells (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that ATP-regulated K+ channels are activated by a smaller reduction in intracellular ATP in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. The differential ATP sensitivity of ATP-regulated K+ channels in endocardial and epicardial cells may be responsible for the differential shortening in action potentials during ischemia at the two sites. \nCarcinoma of the esophagus: CT vs MR imaging in determining resectability. MR imaging and CT were performed prospectively in 35 patients with esophageal carcinoma to determine the resectability of the primary tumors, because at our institution patients with resectable tumors have surgery regardless of the presence of distant metastases. Tumors with evidence of aortic or tracheobronchial invasion on MR or CT were considered to be unresectable. Tracheobronchial invasion was diagnosed when the tumor extended into the lumen of the airway, and aortic invasion was diagnosed when the triangular fat space between the esophagus, aorta, and spine adjacent to the primary tumor was obliterated. Two patients were excluded because of suboptimal MR images produced by motion artifacts. Pathologic proof was obtained from either surgery or autopsy in 31 patients. Of these, six patients (19%) had proved unresectable tumors (three aortic invasion and three tracheobronchial invasion). In all six cases, these features were correctly detected with both MR and CT. One patient had false-positive findings on MR and CT. An indeterminate diagnosis was obtained with MR in three patients and with CT in four patients. These incorrect or indeterminate results were all related to the diagnosis of aortic invasion. No patient had a false-negative result. When indeterminate diagnoses were considered false-positive, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for resectability were 100%, 84%, and 87%, respectively, for MR and 100%, 80%, and 84%, respectively, for CT. We conclude that MR",
