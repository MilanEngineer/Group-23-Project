        "text": "body motility was assessed following 10 wet swallows. In our lab a diagnosis of DES is made when greater than 10% but less than 100% of contractions are simultaneous. Manometric findings of DES were rare, with an overall prevalence of 4% (56/1480). Of the 56 patients with a manometric diagnosis of DES, high-amplitude (mean greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg) peristaltic contractions were found in only two (4%). No simultaneous contractions with amplitude greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg were seen. Pressures of simultaneous contractions were consistently lower than peristaltic contractions. A hypertensive LES pressure (greater than or equal to 45 mm Hg) was present in 5/56 DES patients (9%). Poor LES relaxation was found in 7/56 DES patients (13%). We conclude that DES is a rare manometric finding, regardless of the reason for referral, and that the occurrence of high-amplitude contractions in DES is equally rare. \nProteins of the complement system and acute phase reactants in sera of patients with spinal cord injury. Complement activity was studied in patients with spinal cord transection. In some sera acute phase reactants: haptoglobin, C-reactive proteins, ceruloplasmin, as well as fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products, and immune complexes were monitored. Complement and acute phase reactants are increased in a majority of patients. Continuing inflammation and release of inflammatory mediators could be responsible for poor healing that commonly occurs in spinal cord injury. Urinary tract and other infections are associated with some but not all of the protein abnormalities. These proinflammatory proteins may contribute to the lack of healing of spinal transection. \nThe influence of severity of spinal cord ischemia in the etiology of delayed-onset paraplegia. To clarify the cause of delayed-onset paraplegia, the authors evaluated the neurologic outcome after temporary (10 to 30 minutes) spinal cord ischemia in the awake rabbit. Loss of motor function occurred in less than 2 minutes in all animals. Restoration of flow within 16 minutes always resulted in full return of function, whereas with occlusion times of greater than 27 minutes all animals remained paralyzed. After temporary occlusion of 20 to 21 minutes, however, 71% of animals returned to normal neurologic function but developed delayed-onset paraplegia 14 to 48 hours later. This appears to be a reliable method for the creation of a model of delayed-onset paraplegia in the awake animal, and will facilitate more detailed studies of the pathophysiology of ischemia-induced paraplegia. \nTrauma history in diagnostic groups of temporomandibular disorders. Trauma history was studied for association with disease among six diagnostic subgroups of 230 patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) from a private practice setting with (1) disk displacement (DD) with reduction, (2) DD without reduction, (3) osteoarthrosis (OA) with prior derangement history, (4) primary OA, (5) myalgia only, and (6) subluxation only. Except for subluxation (29%), trauma history typified TMD patient groups 1 to 5 (63%, 79%, 44%, 53%, 54%) (p less than 0.001) compared with 13% and 18% of asymptomatic (n = 61) and symptomatic (n = 161) student control subjects, and 11% of general dental patients (n = 150). TMD groups 2 and 3 differed significantly (p less than 0.05). The high prevalence of trauma in the myalgia-only group complicates the concept of myofascial pain-dysfunction syndrome as solely a stress or centrally mediated disorder. DD without reduction (43%) and with reduction (38%) had the highest prevalences of motor vehicle accident trauma, myalgia and OA groups had less, and subluxation-only cases had none. On the other hand, patients with DD without reduction were also the only group to report multiple trauma (29%), suggesting that although specific traumatic events may seem to precipitate clinical symptoms, they may not always have initiated the problem. Trauma may be both an important cumulative and precipitating event in TMDs. \nLimitations of balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis. Vein graft stenosis remains an important contributing factor to the failure of infrainguinal arterial reconstruction. Repair of these lesions before graft occlusion provides sustained patency, yet the optimal method of repair has not been established. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of these vein graft lesions has been repeatedly advocated as an alternative to surgical revision. Balloon angioplasty was used in 30 patients with 54 stenotic lesions occurring in autogenous vein grafts after infrainguinal reconstruction. The primary 5-year cumulative patency rate was 18% overall, with no significant differences observed among patency rates based on initial indication, length of stenotic lesion, or requirement for preliminary thrombolytic therapy. The 3-year patency rate associated with vein graft lesions requiring only a single angioplasty proved significantly higher (59%) than those requiring repetitive dilations (6%). It is our conclusion that balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis has significant limitations in providing sustained secondary patency. \nSafety and tolerance of oral dextromethorphan in patients at risk for brain ischemia. Experimental ischemia models have shown the antitussive dextromethorphan to be an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist with neuroprotective properties. We treated 10 patients with a history of recent stroke or transient ischemic attack with oral dextromethorphan (60 mg q.i.d.) for 3 weeks in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover tolerance study. We documented no clinical evidence of toxicity attributable to dextromethorphan in this preliminary study. \nImaging of cocaine-induced global and regional myocardial ischemia. Severe and often fatal cardiac complications have been reported in cocaine users with narrowed coronary arteries caused by atherosclerosis as well as in young adults with normal coronaries. We have found that in normal dogs cocaine induces severe temporary hypoperfusion of the left ventricle as indicated by a significantly lower 201Tl concentration compared to the baseline state. The most significant decrease in uptake occurred 5 min after injection and was more pronounced in the septal and apical segments. Following intravenous administration of cocaine, instead of gradual disappearance of 201Tl from the left ventricle, there was continuous increase in 201Tl concentration in the left ventricle. These imaging experiments indicate that the deleterious effects of cocaine on the heart are probably due to spasm of the coronaries and decreased myocardial perfusion. Since spasm of the large subpericardial vessels does not seem to explain the magnitude of the increased coronary resistance and decreased coronary flow after cocaine as described in the literature, it is suggested that microvascular spasm of smaller vessels plays a major role in the temporary decrease in perfusion. The data may also suggest that severe temporary myocardial ischemia is probably the initiating factor for the cardiac complications induced by cocaine. \nFulminant childhood hemophagocytic syndrome mimicking histiocytic medullary reticulosis. An atypical form of Epstein-Barr virus infection. Ten cases of pediatric fulminant hemophagocytic syndrome, encountered between 1986 and 1989, are described. They occurred in the summer, and the patients presented with fever, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and abnormal liver function. Bone marrow studies revealed infiltration by atypical T-lymphoid cells, rare B immunoblasts, and mature histiocytes with hemophagocytosis. Initially, histiocytic medullary reticulosis was suspected in six cases. The clinical course was characterized by rapid deterioration, with a mean period of 16 days from onset of fever to death. The main causes of death were coagulopathy with multiple organ failure and opportunistic infection. In seven of eight cases studied by serologic assay and Southern blot hybridization, acute or active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was documented. It is suggested that an atypical or fulminant form of primary EBV infection distinct from classic infectious mononucleosis was prevalent in previously healthy children in Taiwan. Younger age involvement and seasonal clustering were characteristic of the disorder described. \nMechanisms of visual spatial neglect. Absence of directional hypokinesia in spatial exploration. This study examines whether visuospatial neglect derives from failure in directing hand movements to the left (directional hypokinesia), or from loss of mental representation of the left side of space. Forty right brain-lesioned patients, 28 of whom revealed mild, moderate, or severe neglect in clock drawing and cancellation tasks, were asked to search for concealed targets on a stimulus display board, by either (1) moving a covering panel with a small window until the target appeared, or (2) moving the stimulus display board beneath a stationary covering panel until the target became visible through the window. In the second procedure, the direction of physical space exploration and hand movement is reversed, so that in order to bring a target from the right side of the stimulus into view (under the window) the entire display board had to be moved to the left. This pair of procedures was supplemented by an analogous pair of visual tasks in which the entire display board was visible during the search. As expected, response times were generally longer for targets located on the left side of the display board; however, the direction of required hand movement (left vs right) did not have a significant effect on response times, irrespective of the degree of clinically assessed neglect. \nChimeric NGF-EGF receptors define domains responsible for neuronal differentiation. To determine the domains of the low-affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor required for appropriate signal transduction, a series of hybrid receptors were constructed that consisted of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the human low-affinity NGF receptor (NGFR). Transfection of these chimeric receptors into rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells resulted in appropriate cell surface expression. Biological activity mediated by the EGF-NGF chimeric receptor was assayed by the induction of neurite outgrowth in response to EGF in stably transfected cells. Furthermore, the chimeric receptor mediated nuclear signaling, as evidenced by the specific induction of transin messenger RNA, an NGF-responsive gene. Neurite outgrowth was not observed with chimeric receptors that contained the transmembrane domain from the EGFR, suggesting that the membrane-spanning region and cytoplasmic domain of the low-affinity NGFR are necessary for signal transduction. \nEffects of percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy on levels of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide during exercise. To clarify the factors that influenced the secretion of human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) during exercise, we studied the relations between the changes in ANP, transmitral pressure gradient, heart rate and blood pressure at exercise in 16 patients with mitral stenosis before and after percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC). Before PTMC, ANP levels increased from 107 +/- 70 to 183 +/- 96 pg/ml during exercise testing (p less than 0.01), concomitant with the increment in mean transmitral pressure gradient, heart rate and systolic blood pressure. After PTMC, ANP levels also increased from 78 +/- 43 to 117 +/- 64 pg/ml, concomitant with the increment of those parameters. However, increments of ANP, mean transmitral pressure gradient and heart rate after PTMC were lower than those before PTMC. Because the most important factor influencing the secretion of ANP was unclear, the differences between these parameters were calculated at submaximal exercise before and after PTMC. There was a significant relation only between the change in ANP and mean transmitral pressure gradient (r = 0.70, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that the most important factor influencing the secretion of ANP during exercise is the change in transmitral pressure gradient in patients with mitral stenosis. \nSelf-administered hyperventilation cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 100 s of cardiac arrest during Holter monitoring. An 80-year-old man remained conscious due to vigorous deep breathing during 100 s of ventricular arrest which was recorded on a Holter ECG. Arterial blood flow is considered to have been maintained by changes in intrathoracic pressure produced by deep respiratory movements. This case may represent a pure model of the \"thoracic pump\" mechanism. \nNatural history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. The natural history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) was studied in 23 patients followed for at least 3 years with no treatment. The mean age of the patients was 41 years of age. A large proportion of the VAIN lesions (50%) were multifocal, and approximately one half of the lesions were associated with concomitant cervical or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. Progression to invasive vaginal carcinoma occurred in two (9%) cases, persistence of VAIN occurred in three (13%) cases, and regression of VAIN occurred in 18 (78%) cases. The risk for progression to invasive carcinoma emphasizes the significance of colposcopic examination of the vagina with directed biopsy specimens obtained from all lesions. \nCentral retinal and posterior ciliary artery occlusion after particle embolization of the external carotid artery system. A 15-year-old boy underwent neuroradiologic embolization of the left internal maxillary artery with polyvinyl alcohol to stop traumatic epistaxis after failure of surgical clipping and nasal packing. Selective catheterization of the external carotid artery before embolization showed a faint choroidal blush. Although the procedure provided hemostasis, embolization to the central retinal artery and ciliary arteries resulted in loss of vision. The route of the emboli to the eye was via the anastomotic network of the lacrimal artery supplied by the external carotid artery system. Neuroradiologic embolization of the external carotid artery is an effective mode of therapy for dural-cavernous fistulas when fed by the external carotid artery system. Because the blood flow to the brain and eye is predominantly supplied by the internal carotid artery, embolization of the external carotid artery is considered relatively safe. The authors document the importance of recognition of the choroidal blush during selective external carotid artery angiography as a sign of collateral blood flow to the eye. Physicians and patients need to be aware of the risk of blindness as a complication of external carotid artery embolization when this sign is present. \nFunctional domains of the poliovirus receptor. A number of mutant cDNAs of the human poliovirus receptor were constructed to identify essential regions of the molecule as the receptor. All mutant cDNAs carrying the sequence coding for the entire N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain (domain I) confer permissiveness for poliovirus to mouse L cells, but a mutant cDNA lacking the sequence for domain I does not. The transformants permissive for poliovirus were able to bind the virus and were also recognized by monoclonal antibody D171, which competes with poliovirus for the cellular receptor. These results strongly suggest that the poliovirus binding site resides in domain I of the receptor. Mutant cDNAs for the sequence encoding the intracellular peptide were also constructed and expressed in mouse L cells. Susceptibility of these cells to poliovirus revealed that the entire putative cytoplasmic domain is not essential for virus infection. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule appears not to play a role in the penetration of poliovirus. \nResting energy expenditure in patients with pancreatitis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the resting energy expenditure of hospitalized patients with pancreatitis. DESIGN: Prospective, case-referent study. SETTING: Nutrition support service in a university tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients referred to the Nutrition Support Service with the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Excluded from study entry included those with cancer, obesity (greater than 150% ideal body weight), those measured within 3 postoperative days, or patients requiring ventilator support with an FIO2 of greater than 0.5. Forty-eight patients with either acute pancreatitis (n = 13), chronic pancreatitis (n = 24), acute pancreatitis with sepsis (n = 7), or chronic pancreatitis with sepsis (n = 7) were studied. The two septic groups were combined into a single pancreatitis-with-sepsis group, since no significant differences among measured variables were observed between individual septic groups. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry and compared with the predicted energy expenditure, as determined by the Harris-Benedict equations. Resting energy expenditure (percent of predicted energy expenditure) was significantly (p less than .02) greater for patients with pancreatitis complicated by sepsis (120 +/- 11%) compared with the nonseptic chronic pancreatitis group (105 +/- 14%). Resting energy expenditure for the nonseptic acute pancreatitis patients (112 +/- 17%) was not significantly different from the other groups. The septic pancreatitis group had the largest percentage (82%) of hypermetabolic (resting energy expenditure greater than 110% of predicted energy expenditure) patients, whereas 61% and 33% of the acute and chronic pancreatitis groups were hypermetabolic, respectively (p less than .02). CONCLUSIONS: Resting energy expenditure is variable in patients with pancreatitis (77% to 139% of predicted energy expenditure). The Harris-Benedict equations are an unreliable estimate of caloric expenditure. Septic complications are associated with hypermetabolism and may be the most important factor influencing resting energy expenditure in pancreatitis patients. \nMRC European Carotid Surgery Trial: interim results for symptomatic patients with severe (70-99%) or with mild (0-29%) carotid stenosis. European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group The European Carotid Surgery Trial is a multicentre trial of carotid endarterectomy for patients who, after a carotid territory non-disabling ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or retinal infarct, are found to have a stenotic lesion in the relevant (ipsilateral) carotid artery. Over the past 10 years 2518 patients have been randomised, and the mean follow-up is now almost 3 years among the 2200 thus far available for analysis of the incidence of strokes that lasted more than 7 days. For the patients with \"moderate\" (30-69%) stenosis on their prerandomisation angiogram the balance of surgical risk and eventual benefit remains uncertain, and full recruitment continues. For 374 patients with only \"mild\" (0-29%) stenosis there was little 3-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, even in the absence of surgery, so any 3-year benefits of surgery were small, and were outweighed by its early risks. For 778 patients with \"severe\" (70-99%) stenosis, however, the risks of surgery were significantly outweighed by the later benefits: although 7.5% had a stroke (or died) within 30 days of surgery, during the next 3 years the risks of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke were (by life-table analysis) an extra 2.8% for surgery-allocated and 16.8% for control patients (a sixfold reduction, p less than 0.0001). There was also a small reduction in other strokes, and at 3 years the total risk of surgical death, surgical stroke, ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, or any other stroke was 12.3% for surgery and 21.9% for control (difference 9.6% SD 3.3, 2p less than 0.01). The main concern was to avoid disabling or fatal events, and, among severe stenosis patients, 3.7% had a disabling stroke (or died) within 30 days of surgery, an extra 1.1% surgery versus 8.4% control (p less than 0.0001) had a disabling or fatal ipsilateral ischaemic stroke by 3 years, and the total 3-year risk of any disabling or fatal stroke (or surgical death) was 6.0% surgery versus 11.0% control (overall difference 5.0% SD 2.3, 2p less than 0.05); but, for disabling or fatal stroke the control risks seemed to diminish after the first year, so delay of surgery by just a few months after clinical presentation might make this overall difference non-significant. \nRelapsing transverse myelitis. Acute transverse myelitis is a monophasic disorder, the recurrence of which raises the question of multiple sclerosis (MS) or other multifocal CNS disease. We now report three patients with a previously undescribed syndrome of relapsing isolated acute transverse myelitis. Each had two to five attacks over periods of 3 to 8 years, characterized by ascending paresthesias, urinary retention, sensory loss with a thoracic or cervical level, paraparesis, hyperreflexia, and bilateral Babinski signs. MRI demonstrated areas of increased signal intensity on T2- and proton density-weighted scans and decreased signal intensity on T1-weighed scans of the cervical or thoracic spinal cord consistent with an inflammatory or demyelinating process. All patients had normal complete myelograms, oligoclonal IgG bands were consistently absent from the cerebrospinal fluid, cranial MRIs were normal, and there was no other clinical or laboratory evidence of MS, collagen-vascular disease, or active viral infection. They were treated with high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, stabilized between episodes, and had partial or complete recovery. The recognition of these three patients at a single medical center in a 1-year period suggests that relapses of acute transverse myelitis may not be rare. \nClarification of the identity of the major M2 autoantigen in primary biliary cirrhosis. 1. In primary biliary cirrhosis, the major M2 autoantigen, reacting with antimitochondrial antibodies in sera from greater than 90% of patients, has been identified as the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. However, two recent reports suggest that alternative polypeptides may be major autoantigens. 2. The evidence that a 75 kDa subunit of complex I of the respiratory chain is a major autoantigen (Frostell, Mendel-Hartvig, Nelson, Totterman, Bjorkland & Ragan, Scand. J. Immunol. 1988; 28, 157-65) is refuted. The findings of Frostell et al. can be explained by contamination of complex I with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, evidence for which is presented here. 3. Inspection of the partial amino acid sequence of an unidentified mitochondrial autoantigen (Muno, Kominami, Ishii, Usui, Saituku, Sakakibara & Namihisa, Hepatology 1990; 11, 16-23) shows that it is the E1 beta-subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, previously identified as a major autoantigen, and not a 'new' alternative major autoantigen. 4. These findings substantiate previous work showing that the mitochondrial M2 autoantigens identified so far in primary biliary cirrhosis are all polypeptide components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or the other related 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes. \nA randomized comparative study of laser photocoagulation, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the treatment of actively bleeding ulcers. A randomized study was performed to compare the efficacy of Nd:YAG laser, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the treatment of active bleeding from peptic ulcers. Nine hundred and forty-eight consecutive patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding underwent endoscopy and 91 patients with active bleeding from peptic ulcer were randomized to receive laser (N = 30), heater probe (N = 31), and bipolar electrocoagulation (N = 30). The angulation of the probe to the ulcer base was assessed at endoscopy. The three treatment groups were comparable in their clinical and endoscopic characteristics. There was no significant difference among patients treated with laser, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the rate of re-bleeding (10%, 19.4%, and 10%), duration of hospital stay (4, 4, and 5 days), and proportion requiring emergency surgery (7%, 13%, and 7%), but the cost per patient was higher with laser than heater probe and bipolar electrocoagulation. The angulation of the probe to the ulcer base did not affect the re-bleeding rate. No complication was reported. We conclude that the three modalities were equally effective and safe in endoscopic hemostasis but because bipolar electrocoagulation and heater probe were cheaper, they were recommended for use. \nOcclusive and reperfused myocardial infarcts: MR imaging differentiation with nonionic Gd-DTPA-BMA. To increase the time during which effective contrast exists between normal and infarcted myocardium, a high dose (0.6 mmol/kg) of the nonionic contrast medium gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid bismethylamide (Gd-DTPA-BMA) was used to distinguish between occlusive and reperfused myocardial infarctions in rats. After administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA, there was clear and persistent demarcation of both occlusive and reperfused infarcts on T1-weighted MR images. In occlusive infarcts, normal, infarcted, and periinfarcted myocardium could be identified. High signal intensity was evident for 60 minutes in a band straddling the border between infarcted and normal myocardium, namely, the periinfarction zone. In the reperfused infarct, normal and infarcted myocardium could be identified. The reperfused zone was immediately enhanced after injection of Gd-DTPA-BMA. A differential pattern of enhancement between occlusive and reperfused myocardial infarcts was evident for 1 hour. Thus, Gd-DTPA-BMA has the potential to allow (a) depiction of occlusive and reperfused acute myocardial infarcts, (b) documentation of reperfusion of myocardial infarction, and (c) distinction between occlusive and reperfused infarction. \nUpdate on thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. There is a continuum of clinical research in thrombolytic therapy that will eventually evolve into the most effective regimen to chemically open a thrombosed artery. Numerous previous clinical trials, a number of ongoing trials, and planned future trials are shown in a list of acronyms and their translations as a convenience for identifying the trials. \nDiscontinuation of phenytoin and carbamazepine in patients receiving felbamate. Five patients participated in a controlled discontinuation of phenytoin (PHT) and carbamazepine (CBZ) after a study in which all subjects had felbamate (FBM) added to both PHT and CBZ. Four subjects (three women and 1 man aged 23-36 years) completed the protocol. Mean total seizure frequency per day with PHT and CBZ was 1.33 +/- 0.93 (mean +/- SEM), decreasing to 0.87 +/- 0.71 with addition of FBM, and 0.82 +/- 0.78 after discontinuation of PHT. Only one subject tolerated discontinuation of CBZ; the other three had dosage reductions of 33, 54, and 63%. Toxicity attributable to FBM was not observed, and patients often described less severe seizures. Results from four refractory patients indicated that FBM was able to replace PHT and reduce the need for CBZ. In addition, as PHT dosages were reduced, FBM clearance decreased 21%. As the CBZ dosages were reduced. FBM clearance decreased an additional 16.5%. \nImmunocytological diagnosis of primary cerebral non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Four men with primary cerebral non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed by immunocytological analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) presented with cranial nerve palsies. All had CSF lymphocytoses and low CSF glucose. The cell phenotypes were two T cell tumours, one B cell, and one null. A review of 13 previously recorded cases of immunocytologically diagnosed CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showed that there were 10 B cell, two T cell, and one null tumour. Overall (17 cases) the cell phenotype distribution was 65% B cell, 24% T cell, and 11% null. High CSF lymphocyte counts were found in 94%, proteinosis in 85%, and low CSF glucose in 87%. In contrast to the B cell tumours, all of the T cell tumours were diagnosed by CSF cytology before being visualised radiologically. It is suggested that all CSF lymphocytes (greater than 5 x 10(6)/ml) should be immunohistochemically typed to permit earlier diagnosis of CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. \nSurface appearance and instability of empty H-2 class I molecules under physiological conditions. Recent evidence suggests that endogenously produced antigenic peptides are required for assembly of major histocompatibility complex class I chains with beta 2-microglobulin and transport to the cell surface. The RMA-S mutant cells are thought to be defective in intracellular peptide loading to class I molecules and, therefore, devoid of class I surface expression. Here we report that at physiological temperature (37 degrees C) \"empty\" class I molecules appear at the cell surface of RMA-S cells where they can be trapped with H-2 antibodies. In the absence of the stabilizing ligand, the class I molecules rapidly alter their conformation but remain at the cell surface as demonstrated with a rabbit antiserum. Such denatured H-2 molecules can also be found on normal wild-type RMA cells. However, their amount is strongly reduced after culture of RMA cells with a class I binding peptide. These findings indicate that empty class I molecules appear at the surface not only on mutant but also on normal cells, suggesting that in normal cells the supply with peptides is limited. \nTemporal bone findings in a family with branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR). A family group with confirmed branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome was investigated in this study. Computerized tomography of the temporal bones has demonstrated that the malformations of the inner ear consist of hypoplastic structural changes within the cochlea with reduced vertical diameters, and absent or hypoplastic semicircular canals and normal endolymphatic ducts. It is concluded that in the present cases, the Mondini malformation of the cochlea is not associated with the BOR syndrome. \nMelanoma tumor vaccine: five-year follow-up. For many years, various melanoma vaccines have been employed. This is a unique melanoma vaccine in that it is a subcellular tumor homogenate and no adjuvants have been added. This vaccine has been given to 129 stage I and 61 stage II melanoma patients. All were followed at least 5 years and had 87.5% and 63.9% 5-year survival rates, respectively. Sixty-four stage I males and 65 stage I females had 84% and 90% 5-year survival rates, respectively. We saw no difference between those with or without lymph node dissection. Thirty-six stage II males and 25 stage II females had 66.7% and 60% 5-year survival rates, respectively. Of stage II patients, 23 had only one positive node, 22 had two to four positive nodes, and 9 had five or more positive nodes with 69%, 63%, and 55% 5-year survival rates, respectively. Large published series were used as historical controls [6,27,28], and significant differences were noted when compared to our stage II patients (P = 0.001)--those with two to four positive nodes (P = 0.03), and those with five or more positive nodes (P = 0.04). We conclude that there is a significant increase in survival for these stage II patients, at high risk of recurrence, receiving a tumor homogenate vaccine. This vaccine warrants further analysis, development, and use in a phase III randomized clinical trial. \nReoperative pulmonary resection in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma Resection of pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcoma has been shown to be associated with a 3-year survival of 25% to 30%. The role of multiple resections for recurrent pulmonary metastases, however, has not been clearly defined. Since 1976, 43 patients have had two or more thoracic explorations for the purpose of resecting pulmonary metastases from adult soft tissue sarcoma at our institution. In 89 reexplorations, through either median sternotomy or lateral thoracotomy, the operative mortality was 0%, and 31 of the 43 patients (72%) could be rendered free of disease at the second thoracotomy. Median survival from the second thoracotomy for the patients with resectable disease was 25 months, whereas median survival of patients who had unresectable disease was 10 months. A disease-free interval between the first and second thoracotomies of greater than 18 months was associated with prolonged survival from the second thoracotomy. Owing to lack of other therapies with proven salvage efficacy and in the absence of randomized trials, repeated thoracotomies to render patients free of disease from pulmonary soft-tissue sarcoma metastases appear justified considering the potential survival benefit and low attendant risk. \nIntracellular calcium transients in myocardium from spontaneously hypertensive rats during the transition to heart failure. To investigate the mechanism of impaired myocardial function after long-term pressure overload, we studied cardiac muscle mechanical contraction and intracellular calcium transients using the bioluminescent indicator aequorin. Left ventricular papillary muscle preparations were examined from three groups of rats: 1) aging spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with clinical and pathological evidence suggesting heart failure (SHR-F group), 2) age-matched SHRs with no evidence of heart failure (SHR-NF group), and 3) age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY group). Isometric force development was depressed in both SHR groups relative to the WKY group. Resting [Ca2+]i was lower in the SHR-F group, and the time to peak [Ca2+]i was prolonged in this group. The relative increases in peak [Ca2+]i with the inotropic interventions of increased [Ca2+]o and the addition of isoproterenol were similar among groups. Although inotropy increased in all groups with increased [Ca2+]o, after isoproterenol, inotropy increased only in the WKY group. Thus, in SHR myocardium, [Ca2+]i increased after isoproterenol, but inotropy failed to increase. Myosin isozymes were shifted toward the V3 isoform in both SHR groups; the V3 isoform was virtually 100% in papillary muscles from the SHR-F group. These changes may reflect events directly contributing to the development of heart failure or represent adaptive changes to chronic pressure overload and heart failure. \nA video system for investigating breathing disorders during sleep. A system has been developed for investigating breathing during sleep that superimposes physiological signals on a video image of the patient, with the combined image plus sound recorded on video tape for later analysis. Signals normally displayed include oxygen saturation, airflow, chest wall motion, electroencephalogram, and electrooculogram; but others can be recorded if desired. The information is displayed on a timebase appropriate for the recognition and analysis of respiratory events during sleep. In addition, use is made of normally invisible video lines to record the analogue voltage waveforms so that on replay this information can be displayed on a fast timebase for analysing the more rapidly changing waveforms of electrophysiological signals. The system allows detailed polysomnography to be performed in the normal ward setting with the subject monitored overnight by the nursing staff. Subsequent analysis of the synchronised video, audio, and analogue signals allows measurement of the conventional indices obtained by polysomnography and aids their interpretation. \nEvents in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST): mortality in patients surviving open label titration but not randomized to double-blind therapy. The patient characteristics and outcomes were studied in the 318 patients who survived open label drug titration in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) and who were not randomized to double-blind therapy and in 942 patients, who were randomized to double-blind placebo therapy. The patients randomized to placebo therapy had a lower total mortality or resuscitated cardiac arrest rate (4% vs. 8.5%). However, at baseline, nonrandomized patients were dissimilar from patients randomized to placebo in the following ways: older; lower left ventricular ejection fraction; greater use of digitalis, diuretic drugs and antihypertensive agents; lesser use of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and more frequent prior cardiac problems, including runs of ventricular tachycardia and left bundle branch block. A matched comparison that took these inequities into account showed no significant differences in mortality or rate of resuscitation from cardiac arrest between nonrandomized patients and clinically equivalent patients randomized to placebo. Cox regression analysis indicated that two factors significantly increased the hazard ratio for arrhythmic death or resuscitated cardiac arrest in the nonrandomized patients: female gender (4.7, p less than 0.05) and electrocardiographic events (ventricular tachycardia, proarrhythmia, widened QRS complex, heart block, bradycardia) during open label titration (7.0, p less than 0.005). However, some potentially important differences between men and women were not included in the Cox regression model. Of the nonrandomized patients, approximately 70% were not randomized because of lack of suppression of ventricular premature depolarizations or adverse events, or both, and the remaining 30% because of patient or private physician request with no indication of another reason. \nQuantification of cell kinetic characteristics using flow cytometric measurements of deoxyribonucleic acid and bromodeoxyuridine for bladder cancer. A total of 56 human bladder tumors that were histologically proved to be transitional cell carcinoma was analyzed by simultaneous flow cytometric 2-color measurements of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and bromodeoxyuridine. Bromodeoxyuridine in vitro labeling was performed by sample incubation with bromodeoxyuridine under high atmospheric pressure oxygen. Grade 1 tumors showed 33.3% aneuploidy with a mean bromodeoxyuridine positive stained ratio (labeling index) of 5.1 +/- 3.4%. Grade 2 tumors featured 51.7% aneuploidy with a mean labeling index of 8.9 +/- 7.7%. On the other hand, a markedly increased labeling index of 15.2 +/- 8.2% with aneuploidy was observed in all but 1 grade 3 tumors. When DNA ploidy and labeling indexes were compared according to the presence or absence of muscular invasion of tumors, all 16 muscle invasive tumors showed aneuploidy (mean labeling index 18.7 +/- 8.0%), while 17 of 40 nonmuscle invasive tumors showed aneuploidy (mean labeling index 8.6 +/- 5.4%). This labeling index difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). These results indicate that bromodeoxyuridine/DNA 2-color flow cytometry may provide an objective parameter for quantification of the malignant potential of bladder cancers. \nDevelopment of a computer-aided surgery system: three-dimensional graphic reconstruction for treatment of liver cancer. Simulation of the needle puncture and volume estimation for the tumors in the liver were carried out with the three-dimensional image reconstruction system, which consists of a medical image acquisition system, a data processing system, and a graphic display. A set of sliced-image data from a computerized tomography and/or a magnetic resonance imaging was used to reconstruct the liver, the vessels, and the tumors of the patients with liver cancer. A good agreement of anatomic locations of both the intrahepatic vessels and the tumors between the reconstructed liver model and the echography done intraoperatively was observed. Surgical simulations with these graphic models clearly indicated safety areas for needle puncture in the laser coagulation therapy. In addition liver volumes were calculated within 3% of error in comparison to the measured values. These results indicate that the computer-aided surgery system is a highly promising method that avoids cumbersome stereoscopic recognition of the anatomical location of the diseased area and the vessels, before and after surgery. \nExternal annular prosthesis in repair of biliary tract stricture. A surgical technique for treatment of benign intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary stenosis is described. It is based on the use of annular prostheses of Teflon placed around the outside of the anastomotic line using appropriate surgical instruments. This procedure leaves the blood supply to the bile duct intact, achieves hermetic apposition of epithelia, and prevents leakage of bile. It eliminates the use of intraductal splints, avoids retraction of scar tissue around the anastomotic zone, and increases or maintains the internal diameter of the biliary duct on the anastomotic line. The technique has been used in 33 patients with follow-up from 1 to 10 years. Excellent results were achieved in 32 patients, with 1 patient having a poor result. The average postoperative hospital stay was only 6 days. \nAdrenal rest carcinoma in hilum of kidney. Adrenocortical rests are uncommon in adults and infrequently undergo malignant changes. Most of the published cases are those of functional tumors allowing preoperative diagnosis on the basis of the resulting endocrinopathy. Most nonfunctioning tumors were found accidentally at operation or autopsy. A case is presented of a parapelvic nonfunctioning adrenocortical rest carcinoma situated in the renal hilus in a fifty-year-old woman. No such tumor has been described previously. \nA qualitative approach to primary care research: the long interview. Qualitative research methods offer useful complements to the traditional epidemiologic approaches most commonly used by primary care researchers. Narrative texts generated through open-ended interviews are one form of qualitative data that may provide useful insights into primary care issues that are otherwise overlooked by more structured designs. This paper presents a step-by-step process for conducting a long interview, a qualitative approach with distinct potential for primary care research. Advantages and limitations of the long interview and its relationship to other qualitative methods are also discussed. \nEvidence of a selective increase in cardiac sympathetic activity in patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias BACKGROUND. Although enhanced efferent cardiac sympathetic nervous activity has been proposed as an important factor in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, direct clinical evidence has been lacking. METHODS. We measured the rates of total and cardiac norepinephrine spillover into the plasma, which reflect respectively overall and cardiac sympathetic nervous activity, in 12 patients who had recovered from a spontaneous, sustained episode of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation outside the hospital 4 to 48 days earlier. The results were compared with those from three age-matched reference groups without a history of ventricular arrhythmias: 12 patients with coronary artery disease, 6 patients with chest pain but normal coronary arteries, and 12 healthy, normal subjects. RESULTS. The patients who had had ventricular arrhythmias had reduced left ventricular ejection fractions, as compared with the patients with coronary artery disease or chest pain (mean [+/- SE], 46 +/- 3 percent vs. 58 +/- 4 percent and 69 +/- 5 percent, respectively; P less than 0.003). The rates of total norepinephrine spillover into the plasma were similar in the three reference groups, but 80 percent higher in the patients with ventricular arrhythmias (P less than 0.005). The rate of cardiac norepinephrine spillover was 450 percent higher in these patients (176 +/- 39 pmol per minute, as compared with 32 +/- 8 pmol per minute in the normal subjects; P less than 0.001), a disproportionate increase relative to the increase in total spillover, which indicated selective activation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow. This increase in cardiac norepinephrine spillover was probably caused by a reduction in left ventricular function. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that in some patients major ventricular arrhythmias are associated with and perhaps caused by sustained and selective cardiac sympathetic activation. We speculate that depressed ventricular function was present before the ventricular arrhythmia occurred, and that this resulted in reflex cardiac sympathetic activation, which in turn contributed to the genesis of the arrhythmia. \nBezold-Jarisch reflex in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patients. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex is an inhibitory reflex that originates from the heart, is mediated by the vagus nerve, and is manifested by hypotension and bradycardia. We present 4 pediatric cardiac surgical patients, aged 1 day to 9 months, who exhibited cardiovascular collapse in their early postoperative course. In each patient, cardiovascular deterioration was marked by an insidious decrease in arterial blood pressure without an associated change in heart rate, central venous pressure, or airway pressure. Bradycardia followed the decrease in blood pressure. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex was suspected and atropine was administered, first as a bolus injection at 0.01 mg/kg, and later, as a continuous infusion at 0.01 mg.kg-1.h-1. Atropine prevented recurrent episodes of hypotension and bradycardia. We believe the Bezold-Jarisch reflex is more prevalent than previously suspected in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patients. \nSonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Acute appendicitis can be a diagnostic dilemma. The classic triad of leukocytosis, pain at McBurney's point and a history compatible with appendicitis has a diagnostic accuracy rate of only 80 percent. Ultrasonography, combined with this triad, can improve the diagnostic accuracy, decreasing the negative laparotomy rate from 20 percent to less than 10 percent. \nMycotic aneurysms of the carotid arteries--case report and review of the literature. Mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries are rare. We report a new case with a mycotic aneurysm of the carotid bifurcation associated with acute bacterial endocarditis of the aortic valve. A concomitant treatment of both lesions was performed. Twenty-six cases of mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries have been reported in the literature. We present a review of all these cases. \nPrevalence of proximal faecal stasis in active ulcerative colitis. Proximal faecal stasis may occur when faecal matter accumulates in the uninflamed colon above an area of active ulcerative colitis. This phenomenon is thought to be the cause of symptoms in some patients with distal disease. It is not known, however, how often patients with active distal colitis exhibit slow colonic transit. Fifty two consecutive patients with active ulcerative colitis each ingested 10 radio-opaque markers nightly for 14 days. Minimum colonic transit times were derived from counts of retained markers shown by plain abdominal radiography on the 15th day. The transit times for each patient were related to their disease extent and bowel frequency. Four patients had colonic transit times greater than one week and two others had evidence of relative stasis. The results indicate that approximately 10% of attacks of distal colitis are associated with faecal stasis. \nAdenocarcinoma of the pancreas: a multimodality approach--a single surgeon's experience (1979-1988). A retrospective review of a single surgeon's experience with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was performed. One hundred-one patients were treated over a 10-year period from 1979 to 1988. Seven patients underwent potentially curative resections and 28 patients presented with metastatic (stage IV) disease. Sixty-four patients had locally advanced and unresectable primary lesions. A total of 51 patients received I-125 seed implantation. There was no statistically significant difference in morbidity (33% vs. 30%) or mortality (6% vs. 8%) between patients receiving I-125 implantation and those undergoing palliative surgical procedures without implantation. Operative mortality was highest in patients presenting with stage IV lesions (11%). In those patients with locally advanced and unresectable carcinomas, there was a nonsignificant increase in survival (12.8 mo vs. 10.7 mo) in those receiving intraoperative I-125 implants when compared to those who did not when both groups received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. Based on these encouraging results, it is concluded that I-125 implantation can be performed safely and shows a trend toward improving long-term survivorship in patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma when used in conjunction with chemotherapy and external beam radiation. \nHead-up tilt for the evaluation of syncope of unknown origin in children. Fifteen patients aged 10 to 18 years with syncope of unknown origin, and 10 healthy control children aged 11 to 18 years, were evaluated by head-up tilt to 60 degrees for 60 minutes. Six patients (43%) reproduced symptoms of syncope during the examination. Four had a typical vasovagal reaction; two had marked hyperventilation. None of the children in the control group had syncope. The head-up tilt test offers a simple, noninvasive, high-yielding diagnostic tool for evaluation of syncope in children. \nAnalysis and interpretation of treatment effects in subgroups of patients in randomized clinical trials. A key principle for interpretation of subgroup results is that quantitative interactions (differences in degree) are much more likely than qualitative interactions (differences in kind). Quantitative interactions are likely to be truly present whether or not they are apparent, whereas apparent qualitative interactions should generally be disbelieved as they have usually not been replicated consistently. Therefore, the overall trial result is usually a better guide to the direction of effect in subgroups than the apparent effect observed within a subgroup. Failure to specify prior hypotheses, to account for multiple comparisons, or to correct P values increases the chance of finding spurious subgroup effects. Conversely, inadequate sample size, classification of patients into the wrong subgroup, and low power of tests of interaction make finding true subgroup effects difficult. We recommend examining the architecture of the entire set of subgroups within a trial, analyzing similar subgroups across independent trials, and interpreting the evidence in the context of known biologic mechanisms and patient prognosis. \nVentricular dysfunction does occur during liver transplantation. Ventricular dysfunction, then, does indeed occur during liver transplantation, particularly at the time of reperfusion. Pulmonary embolism contributes to right ventricular and right atrial encroachment on left-heart filling, and paradoxical embolism may occur. Pericardial effusions, tricuspid regurgitation, hypothermia, and the release of substances, particularly potassium from the donor liver, may further contribute to compromises in ventricular function. Proper monitoring and appropriate treatment, however, lead to successful operative outcomes in most cases. \nImpact of variability among surgeons on postoperative morbidity and mortality and ultimate survival. OBJECTIVE--To assess the differences among surgeons in postoperative complications, postoperative mortality, and survival in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. DESIGN--Prospective study of patients with colorectal cancer managed by one of 13 consultant surgeons, none of whom had a special interest in colorectal surgery. SETTING--Royal Infirmary, Glasgow. PATIENTS--645 sequential patients with colorectal cancer presenting over the six years from 1974 to 1979. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Postoperative complications, postoperative mortality (within 30 days), and survival (up to 10 years); predictive factors for postoperative mortality and survival; and relative hazard rate ratios for individual surgeons. RESULTS--The proportion of patients undergoing apparently curative resection varied among surgeons from 40% to 76%; overall postoperative mortality varied from 8% to 30%. After curative resection postoperative mortality varied from 0% to 20%, local recurrence from 0% to 21%, and the rate of anastomotic leak from 0% to 25%. Survival at 10 years in patients who underwent curative resection varied from 20% to 63%, two year survival in those who underwent palliative resection varied from 7% to 32%, and median survival in those who underwent palliative diversion varied from one to eight months. The hazard rate ratios among individual surgeons, taking into account the identified risk factors, varied from 0.56 to 2.03, from 0.17 to 1.92, and from 0.57 to 1.50 for curative resection, palliative resection, and palliative diversion, respectively. CONCLUSION--There were significant variations in patient outcome among surgeons after surgery for colorectal cancer; such differences compromise survival. A considerable improvement in overall survival might be achieved if such surgery were undertaken by surgeons with a special interest in colorectal surgery or surgical oncology. \nEffects of alfentanil and fentanyl on induction of anaesthesia in patients with severe pregnancy-induced hypertension. Forty patients with severe pregnancy-induced hypertension presenting for Caesarean section under general anaesthesia were allocated randomly to receive either fentanyl 2.5 micrograms kg-1 or alfentanil 10 micrograms kg-1 as part of the anaesthetic induction sequence. In all patients, the cardiovascular response to tracheal intubation was measured. Both drugs attenuated the response equally but did not abolish it in all patients. Alfentanil 10 micrograms kg-1 is a suitable alternative to fentanyl 2.5 micrograms kg-1 for patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension. \nHemangioma of the nasal vault: MR and CT features. Six patients with a history of epistaxis (five patients) or nasal obstruction (one patient) were found to have a capillary hemangioma of the nasal vault that involved one or more nasal turbinates. Four patients underwent computed tomographic (CT) examination; two of these also underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Four others underwent only MR imaging. At CT and MR, all of the lesions were well circumscribed and intensely enhancing, with contralateral deviation of the nasal septum. Remodeling of the surrounding bone was present in three patients. On T1-weighted MR images, the masses were intermediate in signal intensity. Varying degrees of T2 shortening were shown on T2-weighted MR images, with an appearance that suggested the presence of blood products surrounding an inner matrix of higher-signal-intensity tumor. Intense enhancement at CT and MR assisted differentiation of tumor from retained sinonasal secretions. In two patients, external carotid arteriography revealed small foci of pooling contrast material; in one of these patients, arteriovenous shunting was also present. Pathologic examination in all patients demonstrated capillary hemangiomas with varying degrees of fibrosis and hemosiderin deposition. \nSarcomatous change in a teratoma after treatment of testicular carcinoma. Treatment can transform the metastases of nonseminomatous germ cell carcinoma into histologically mature teratoma. These lesions typically have a benign clinical course. The authors present a case of leiomyosarcoma occurring within such a lesion. It arose 18 years after therapy for metastatic embryonal carcinoma of the testis and appears to have been radiation induced. \nOssicular chain reconstruction: a combined prosthesis with organic and synthetic material. The surgical techniques to restore the sound pressure transfer mechanism in surgery of chronic otitis media are still in an evolutionary stage. Ossicular interposition is effective and certainly is not controversial. The use of various organic prostheses has been criticized. The prosthesis with a shaft of Teflon and a homograft bone flange is an alternative method which has been successful in our hands. \nPolycystic ovaries: do these represent a specific endocrinopathy? Serum pituitary gonadotrophins, oestradiol, testosterone and insulin pulse patterns were examined at 15-min intervals for 6 h in 40 women with a previous diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) based on clinical, endocrinological and ultrasound data. Age, duration of symptoms, body mass index (BMI) and ovarian volume showed no correlation with the 6-h mean value of any hormone and testosterone blood levels did not correlate with those of insulin. Some patients had high and others low LH pulse pattern components, and few had an inverted LH:FSH ratio. Morphological polycystic ovarian changes may be a reflection of various rather than a single pattern of gonadotrophin secretion. \nInterferon-gamma inhibits arterial stenosis after injury. BACKGROUND. Arterial injury initiates a proliferative response among the smooth muscle cells of the artery. This leads to the formation of a thickened intima that may reduce the diameter of the arterial lumen. Such intimal lesions often develop after vascular surgery and angioplastic procedures. Previous cell culture studies have shown that the lymphokine, interferon-gamma (gIFN), inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. METHODS AND RESULTS. We therefore tested whether administration of exogenous gIFN could inhibit the development of intimal lesions. Rat carotid arteries were denuded with a balloon catheter, resulting in the formation of a standardized intimal lesion. The animals were then treated with recombinant rat gIFN at 200,000 units (approximately 400,000 units or 100 micrograms/kg body wt) administered parenterally once daily for 7 days. Autoradiographic analysis of 3H-thymidine incorporation revealed that gIFN reduced the early smooth muscle replication by approximately 75%. gIFN treatment for 1 week resulted in a 50% reduction of intimal cross-section area at 2 weeks after injury when compared to control rats injected with buffer alone. The difference in lesion development persisted in rats analyzed 10 weeks after injury, suggesting that proliferative events during the first week determine the long-term development of the intima. Inhibition of lesion development was accompanied by expression of the class II histocompatibility (Ia) gene, RT1B, suggesting that both were directly related to the administration of gIFN. CONCLUSIONS. These results show that gIFN is a potent inhibitor of the formation of arterial proliferative lesions in vivo. It is possible that gIFN could be useful in preventing arterial stenosis after surgery and angioplasty in man. \nGenetic susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. Genetic factors clearly cause Lewy-body Parkinson's disease (PD) in a subset of autosomal-dominant families. However, most cases of PD are sporadic. The two most likely models of four discussed for sporadic PD are the reduced penetrance model and the multifactorial model. Sporadic PD is likely to be caused by the combined effect of environmental precipitating factors and genetic susceptibility factors. Because the number of major genetic factors is likely to be small, these hypotheses can be tested and genetic factors located using linkage mapping techniques. The affected pair analysis methods are especially suited to PD. Finding the genetic susceptibility factors for PD is important because this may be the fastest way to identify the environmental precipitating factors and because it may lead to prevention of PD. Because of the usefulness of identifying genetic susceptibility factors for PD, we are carrying out linkage studies in a group of 16 large autosomal-dominant families with PD and more than 300 living affected PD pairs. \nChanges in neutrophil met-enkephalin containing peptides in episodic cluster headache. We have previously demonstrated an increase in plasma met-enkephalin levels during the pain attacks in episodic cluster headache. The present study was undertaken in order to clarify the source of the plasma met-enkephalin increase. Recent evidence has shown that peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells contain peptides derived from the proenkephalin A system, which can be released by specific stimuli. We studied neutrophil met-enkephalin containing peptides (NMECP) in 27 episodic cluster headache patients: 24 in a cluster period (6 of them during a pain attack), and 3 in the remission period. Neutrophil met-enkephalin containing peptide levels (after sequential enzymatic digestion with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B) were determined by radioimmunoassay with specific antiserum. Neutrophil peptide concentration (pmol/mg prot) was lower (p less than 0.01) in patients during the pain attack (14.4 +/- 0.36) than after their pain had subsided (36.7 +/- 0.31) and lower than in the remission period patients (35.8 +/- 0.4). We conclude that neutrophil met-enkephalin containing peptides decrease during pain in episodic cluster headache, and that they may be involved in the concomitant plasma met-enkephalin increase. \nEarly abdominal complications following heart and heart-lung transplantation. In the first 11 years of the heart and heart-lung transplantation programme at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, 356 patients underwent heart transplantation, and 73 patients received both heart and lungs. Out of 429 patients 41 (9.5 per cent) developed abdominal complications within the first 30 days, and 20 of the 41 required surgery. The complications included pancreatitis (10), peptic ulceration (8), and pseudo-obstruction (8), in addition to colonic perforation and small bowel obstruction. When laparotomy was performed it was well tolerated. This paper supports the view that successful management of abdominal complications following transplantation requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Where doubt exists in the presence of an acute abdomen, laparotomy is the appropriate way to establish a definitive diagnosis. \nAcute and chronic hemodynamic effects of xamoterol in mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Xamoterol, a new beta 1 partial agonist, has the potential to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone in patients with heart failure. Its properties should result in beta-receptor stimulatory effects at low levels of sympathetic tone and beta-receptor protective effects at higher levels of sympathetic tone. The acute effects of intravenous (i.v.) xamoterol on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise were studied in 30 patients with mild to moderate heart failure (13 patients in New York Heart Association class II; 17 in class III) due to ischemic (n = 24) or cardiomyopathic (n = 6) heart disease. Cardiac index, stroke volume and stroke work index at rest were significantly improved after i.v. administration of xamoterol and consistent with net agonist effects. During exercise, heart rate and double product were significantly reduced (net antagonist effects), but with preservation of the expected increases in cardiac index and systolic blood pressure. These hemodynamic findings confirm the ability of xamoterol to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone. Tachyphylaxis and arrhythmogenicity limit the chronic use of drugs with full beta-agonist properties as positive inotropes in heart failure. The patients were therefore entered into a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of chronic oral xamoterol therapy, 200 mg twice daily, and the hemodynamic responses to i.v. xamoterol were repeated at the end of the trial. No impairment in either resting or exercise effects was observed, indicative of a maintained response and absence of tachyphylaxis after chronic therapy. Furthermore, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed no change in ventricular arrhythmias during oral treatment. \nEwing's sarcoma in children: twenty-five years of experience at the Instituto Portuges de Oncologia de Francisco Gentil (I.P.O.F.G.). Fifty children with Ewing's sarcoma were consecutively treated from 1962 to 1987 and retrospectively analyzed at the I.P.O.F.G. of Lisbon. At first diagnosis, 10 cases had distant metastases. The remaining 40 patients had clinically localized disease, and different protocols were followed over the years. The best results were obtained with chemotherapy and radiotherapy with or without surgery; and for these children the two-year survival rate was 42.8% vs. 8.3% for the group of patients submitted to local treatment alone. Besides the treatment modality, other factors influenced the prognosis, such as inflammatory signs, sex, tumor volume, and tumor site as well as evidence of distant metastases. \nThe role of epidermal growth factor in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease. Duodenal biopsies obtained from seven normal subjects and six ulcerous patients were cultured in vitro for 30 min at 37 degrees C under various experimental conditions. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and somatostatin released in the culture medium were determined by radioimmunoassay. Under basal conditions, EGF and somatostatin levels were significantly higher in normal subjects (11.49 +/- 3.07 ng/mg protein and 3.06 +/- 0.8 ng/mg protein, respectively) than in ulcerous patients (6.9 +/- 1.98 ng/mg protein and 1.75 +/- 1.23 ng/mg protein, respectively). However, when antibodies to somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were added together to the culture media, in ulcerous patients, EGF levels also were lower as absolute values, but were higher as a percentage of variation than controls (p less than 0.05). The fall of EGF secretion from tissue cultures of ulcerous patients could be the consequence of endocrine cellular loss or damage, rather than the cause of ulceration. Moreover, the EGF-producing cells around the lesion in ulcerous patients seems to be hyperactive, and this hyperfunction of EGF-producing cells might contribute to the in vivo repair of tissue damage. \nValidation of hourly pain intensity profiles with chronic pain patients. This study examines how empirically derived pain intensity profiles relate to psychological adjustment in chronic pain patients. Hourly pain intensity ratings over the course of a day of 189 chronic pain patients were categorized into 6 groups using a hierarchical regression analysis technique. The profiles reflected linear, curvilinear, multilinear or \"no profile\" effects. Judges' ratings of pain intensity profiles were found to be less reliable than ratings based on empirical analysis. The majority of patients showed linear profiles while 26% of the patients showed no consistent relationship between hourly pain intensity and time of day. Patients who showed no consistent trend in their pain ratings reported having significantly higher ratings of emotional distress. They tended to have conflicts at home and showed more pain behavior than patients who had a distinct pain profile. Support is given for the potential clinical utility of pain rating profiles. \nIntrathoracic complications following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: CT findings. The authors retrospectively reviewed computed tomographic (CT) scans of 18 patients who developed 21 episodes of intrathoracic complications after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Pathologic and/or microbiologic diagnoses were available for all patients. All patients were immunocompromised due to either graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), neutropenia, or recurrent malignancy after BMT. CT demonstrated diagnostically relevant findings that were not apparent at radiography in 12 of the 21 cases (57%). These included a ground-glass pattern in early pneumonia (n = 5); a peripheral distribution in GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, and eosinophilic drug reaction (n = 4); cavitating lesions in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (n = 1); hemorrhagic infarcts in aspergillosis (n = 1); and mediastinal adenopathy in recurrent Hodgkin disease (n = 1). The authors conclude that chest CT is superior to radiography in demonstrating the presence, distribution, and extent of intrathoracic complications developing in patients after allogeneic BMT. CT is useful in guiding procedures for tissue diagnosis. \nResting energy expenditure in patients with newly detected gastric and colorectal cancers. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured in 104 patients with newly detected gastric or colorectal (GCR) cancer and was compared with two groups of control subjects without cancer: healthy subjects (H control subjects) and patients with nonmalignant diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (GI patients). REE in GCR-cancer patients was not significantly different from REE in GI patients or H control subjects. Comparison of measured REE with predicted REE obtained from prediction equations may erroneously suggest that increased REE is a contributing factor in the development of cancer cachexia. No significant differences in REE were found when patients with liver metastases were compared with patients without metastases. There were no differences in REE between gastric and colorectal cancer patients. The decrease in energy expenditure, which normally occurs during starvation and weight loss in healthy men and women, could not be demonstrated in weight-losing, GCR-cancer patients. In conclusion, elevation of REE contributes little to the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia in GCR-cancer patients. \nCaesarean section in undiagnosed Eisenmenger's syndrome. Report of a patient with a fatal outcome. An obstetric patient is described in whom the first sign of cardiac disease was unexplained hypoxaemia during emergency anaesthesia for antepartum haemorrhage, with an eventual fatal outcome. The case highlights the importance of patient information at the booking clinic, and the implications of a raised haemaglobin in early pregnancy. \nAcute airway obstruction, hypertension and kyphoscoliosis. An elderly woman developed acute respiratory obstruction after choking on a bolus of food. On rigid bronchoscopy no foreign body, or anatomical obstruction was seen, but airway obstruction recurred during emergence from general anaesthesia, and was thought to be functional in nature. A recurring airway obstruction followed, relieved by induction of anaesthesia and by sedation. This was subsequently demonstrated to be caused by a tortuous aorta which impinged intermittently on the anterior tracheal wall, as a result of kyphoscoliosis of the thoracic spine. We attribute the relief of airway obstruction by general anaesthesia to a reduction in arterial blood pressure. \nSerum immune response to Helicobacter pylori in children: epidemiologic and clinical applications. Antibody responses to Helicobacter pylori were measured by a solid-phase whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 150 children and adolescents; in 47 consecutive children undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, including 17 with H. pylori infection before and after antimicrobial treatment; and in 46 family members of the infected children. Abnormal levels of either IgG or IgA were found in 6% of the 150 children. In the latter group the prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity increased with age. Parents and siblings of the infected children had 94% and 71% seropositivity, respectively, suggesting intrafamilial spread. Abnormal levels of IgG or IgA against H. pylori identified infected children with 95% sensitivity and 84% specificity. Eradication of the infection was accompanied by a significant decrease in IgG and IgA titers, with normalization in 10 cured patients in 12 months or less. We conclude that the method described for evaluation of H. pylori-specific IgG and IgA antibodies gives helpful information on the epidemiology of the infection and represents a useful adjunct to diagnosis and management of chronic gastritis in children. \nEndothelium-dependent responses of cerebral blood vessels during chronic hypertension. Acetylcholine produces less dilatation of pial arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) than in normotensive (WKY) rats. Responses of cerebral vessels to acetylcholine and bradykinin appear to involve different mechanisms. Our first goal was to determine whether responses of pial arterioles to bradykinin are impaired in SHRSP. Diameter of pial arterioles (20-60 microns) was measured using intravital microscopy in WKY rats and SHRSP (9-12 months old). Superfusion of bradykinin (3 x 10(-7) M) dilated pial arterioles by 35 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) in WKY rats, but only 21 +/- 3% in SHRSP (p less than 0.05 versus WKY rats). Both nitric oxide (5 x 10(-7) M) and nitroglycerin (10(-5) M) produced similar vasodilatation in WKY rats and SHRSP. Our second goal was to determine whether alteration of postreceptor mechanisms contributes to impairment of endothelium-dependent cerebral vasodilatation in SHRSP. Calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-5) M) produced more vasodilatation in WKY rats than in SHRSP (32 +/- 8% versus 9 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05). Responses to A23187 (10(-5) M) were inhibited by indomethacin (46 +/- 13% versus 15 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05) in WKY rats, whereas responses to A23187 (10(-6) M) were potentiated modestly by indomethacin (-3 +/- 2% versus 4 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05) in SHRSP. \nMolecular epidemiology and the genetics of environmental cancer. Environmental, occupational, and recreational exposures to carcinogens contribute to cancer risk in humans. Cancer formation is a multistage process involving tumor initiation, promotion, conversion, and progression. Carcinogens can affect any of these stages through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The association of a suspected carcinogenic exposure and cancer risk can be studied in populations with classic epidemiologic techniques. However, these techniques are not applicable to the assessment of risk in individuals. Molecular epidemiology, in contrast, is a field that integrates molecular biology, in vitro and in vivo laboratory models, biochemistry, and epidemiology to infer individual cancer risk. Carcinogen-macromolecular adduct levels, and somatic cell mutations can be measured to determine the biologically effective dose of a carcinogen. Molecular epidemiology also explores host cancer susceptibilities, such as carcinogen metabolic activation, DNA repair, endogenous mutation rates, and inheritance of mutated tumor suppressor genes. Substantial interindividual variation for each of these biologic end points has been shown and, therefore, highlights the need for assessing cancer risk on an individual basis. Given the pace of the last decade, it is feasible that the next 10 years will allow molecular epidemiologists to develop a cancer-risk profile for an individual that includes assessment of a number of factors. This will help focus preventive strategies and strengthen quantitative risk assessments. \nAbnormal small bowel permeability and duodenitis in recurrent abdominal pain. Thirty nine children with recurrent abdominal pain aged between 5.5 and 12 years, underwent endoscopic duodenal biopsy to find out if there were any duodenal inflammatory changes, and if there was a relationship between duodenal inflammation and intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA. Duodenal inflammation was graded by the duodenitis scale of Whitehead et al (grade 0, 1, 2, and 3). In 13 out of 39 patients (33%) definite signs of inflammation were found (grade 2 and 3). Intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA in patients with duodenitis (grade 1, 2, and 3) was significantly higher (4.42 (1.73)%) than in patients with normal (grade 0) duodenal biopsy appearances (3.3 (0.9)%). A significant association was found between duodenal inflammation and abnormal intestinal permeability. Our results give further evidence that there is an intestinal origin of these patients' complaints. \nClinical evaluation of closed-loop control of blood pressure in seriously ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a new method of closed-loop (automatic) control of BP with usual manual control. DESIGN: Within-subject crossover trial. SETTING: General and open heart ICUs in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Convenience sample of 74 seriously ill patients aged 17 to 88 yr. Twenty had hypertension: postoperative (n = 7), neurologic damage (n = 6), miscellaneous (n = 7), and were prescribed nitroprusside (n = 11) or nitroglycerin (n = 9). Fifty-four had hypotension: septic (n = 33), other (n = 21), and were prescribed norepinephrine (n = 30), dopamine (n = 11), epinephrine (n = 8), or dobutamine (n = 5). An additional 21 trials were omitted from analysis because of technical (n = 7), clinical (n = 1), or drug-related problems (n = 13). INTERVENTION: Closed-loop and manual drug administrations 1-hr were studied during periods in each patient. The target and observed mean arterial pressure (MAP) and drug infusion rate were recorded electronically every 30 sec. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Time taken to achieve initial control (min); fidelity of control (the integral of size and duration of error from target MAP +/- 10% in mm Hg.hr/hr); and average drug dose administered (microgram/min as % maximum possible per drug). RESULTS: Compared with manual control, closed-loop achieved faster initial control (log-rank chi 1 = 5.04, p less than .05) and greater fidelity (mean 1.37 vs. 2.36; F = 7.15, p less than .01). There was no difference in average drug dose administered. There was uniformity in the efficacy advantage of closed-loop drug administration across drugs and patient classifications. CONCLUSION: The new closed-loop system is more effective than the usual manual control in managing acute BP disturbances in the seriously ill patient. \nHemodynamic and oxygen transport changes following endotracheal suctioning in trauma patients. Hemodynamic and oxygen transport responses to four preoxygenation techniques prior to endotracheal suctioning (ETS) were evaluated in 24 critically ill trauma patients with no preexisting lung disease. A within-subjects, repeated measures design was used. All patients had functional arterial and pulmonary artery catheters and were ventilated with a Puritan-Bennett 7200 which could immediately deliver a fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 1.0. Six breaths of maintenance FIO2 and hyperinflation without hyperoxygenation caused a fall in tissue oxygen delivery as measured by continuous transcutaneous oximetry (PtcO2). The largest increases in PtcO2 and arterial oxygen tension were seen with hyperoxygenation alone and a combination of hyperoxygenation and hyperinflation. No significant changes were found in hemodynamic (cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance) or oxygen transport variables (oxygen delivery, oxygen extraction, oxygen consumption) 5 minutes postsuctioning. During both hyperinflation protocols, patients experienced dyspnea. It was concluded that three hyperoxygenation breaths before ETS, using a clinically feasible protocol, are adequate in preventing postsuction hypoxemia in young, hemodynamically stable trauma patients. Large volumes of hyperinflation, although found to increase PtcO2, are not advocated because of demonstrated patient discomfort and the possibility of barotrauma. \n1990 ARRS Executive Council Award. Intravascular sonography in the detection of arteriosclerosis and evaluation of vascular interventional procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of intravascular sonography for the detection of arteriosclerosis and to determine the effects of vascular interventional procedures on the arterial wall. A catheter-based 20-MHz transducer was used. Forty patients were studied. Twelve had clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease, 13 were healthy renal donors, and 15 underwent vascular interventional procedures. The aorta and the ipsilateral iliac artery were examined in real time under fluoroscopic guidance and the results were compared with angiography. Sonography in eight of the 13 renal donors showed arterial wall abnormalities in the absence of angiographic evidence of disease. Sonography of the 15 patients after angioplasty or atherectomy demonstrated plaque fractures, intramural dissections, or atherectomy grooves. Our experience suggests that intravascular sonography is of value in reducing the use of angiography to monitor progress or complications of vascular interventional procedures. \nBilateral episodic mydriasis as a migraine equivalent in childhood: a case report. We report a 14-year-old girl who presented with yearly attacks of bilateral internal ophthalmoplegia, nausea and headache, since the age of nine. The episodic isolated bilateral mydriasis in this child is believed to be a migraine equivalent. \nAltered swallowing function in elderly patients without dysphagia: radiologic findings in 56 cases. Swallowing disorder is an increasing problem in our aging population. A majority of these patients have a functional abnormality of the oral, pharyngeal, and/or esophageal stage of swallowing. However, what constitutes normalcy is not well understood, and baseline swallowing in elderly persons without dysphagia has not been adequately described. We therefore evaluated 56 persons with a mean age of 83 years who had no symptoms of dysphagia or eating difficulty. Videofluoroscopy and radiographs with the subject erect and recumbent were obtained. Normal deglutition, as defined in young persons, was present in only 16%. Oral abnormalities (difficulty ingesting, controlling, and delivering bolus relative to swallowing initiation) were seen in 63%. Pharyngeal dysfunction (bolus retention and lingual propulsion or pharyngeal constrictor paresis) was seen in 25%. Pharyngoesophageal segment abnormalities were observed in 39% (mostly cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction). Esophageal abnormalities (mostly motor in nature) were observed in 36%. What has been described as swallowing dysfunction in young persons may not be abnormal in very elderly persons. It is difficult to distinguish the effect of normal aging from the effects of specific diseases or gradual degenerative changes. \nDouble intensive consolidation chemotherapy in adult acute myeloid leukemia. Of 115 adult patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 87 (75.5%) achieved complete remission (CR) after induction treatment with zorubicin and conventional doses of cytarabine (Ara-C). Patients under age 45 years with histocompatibility locus antigen-identical sibling underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The others were treated with two courses of intensive consolidation chemotherapy (ICC): course 1 with 4 days of high-dose Ara-C and 3 days of amsacrine (m-AMSA); course 2 with carmustine (BCNU), Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Forty-two patients received both planned courses, 15 received only the first, and 13 patients could only support conventional maintenance therapy. Four patients died during consolidation. With a median follow-up of 60 months, the disease-free survival (DFS) after ICC at 5 years is 40.3% (+/- 6.5%), with no statistically significant difference between patients receiving one or two courses. The DFS for the 17 transplanted patients is comparable (P = .72) and is lower for the 13 excluded patients (23% +/- 11.5%, P = .046). Age did not influence the probability of remaining in CR. In univariate analysis, three parameters had a negative impact on the 5-year DFS: a high initial WBC count (52% for patients with less than 30 x 10(9) WBC/L v 12% for patients with greater than 30 x 10(9) WBC/L, P = .01), a long delay between induction treatment and course 1 (+/- 60 days; 63% v 29%, P = .01), and a long delay between course 1 and course 2 (+/- 60 days, 61.5% v 28.5%, P = .05). In multivariate analysis (Cox model), only the WBC count remained significant. This study confirms the value of intensive postremission chemotherapy, which can be compared in AML with allogeneic or autologous BMT. It also demonstrates the prognostic value of the initial WBC count. The optimal modalities of ICC remain to be defined by further studies. \nIntravascular IL-8. Inhibitor of polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation at sites of acute inflammation. IL-8 has been characterized primarily as a polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemoattractant and proinflammatory mediator. Recently, we have reported that [Ala-IL-8]77 is secreted by activated cultured human endothelial cells and can function as a potent inhibitor of PMN adhesion to these monolayers. The pathophysiologic relevance of this in vitro observation was examined by determining the effects of intravascular or extravascular administration of IL-8 on PMN emigration at sites of acute inflammation in the skin of NZW rabbits. An i.v. bolus of [Ala-IL-8]77 (12 micrograms/kg) produced a marked and selective reduction of circulating PMN within 3 min, which returned toward preinjection levels within 30 min, and subsequently exceeded this level. A similar response was observed for circulating radiolabeled PMN, and gamma-scintigraphy determined that the lungs were the primary site of leukosequestration. During the 30- to 150-min interval after i.v. infusion of [Ala-IL-8]77, PMN emigration into acute inflammatory sites, elicited by various chemoattractants or cytokines, was significantly reduced, as judged histologically and quantitated with 51Cr-labeled PMN and myeloperoxidase measurements. Intravenous administration of [Ser-IL-8]72 yielded similar results. This inhibitory effect of i.v. IL-8 was transient and reinducible and did not reflect a suppression of the responsiveness of circulating PMN to chemoattractants. Intradermal injections of [Ala-IL-8]77 or [Ser-IL-8]72 induced dose-dependent PMN accumulation, which also was significantly reduced by i.v. administration of either form of IL-8. These results indicate that i.v. IL-8 can function as a PMN-directed leukocyte adhesion inhibitor and suggest that local secretion of IL-8 by activated endothelium may differentially modulate leukocyte-endothelial interactions at sites of acute inflammation. \nAcute and chronic urticaria and angioedema. Urticaria and angioedema are clinical manifestations of various immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms, or they may be idiopathic. The respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as well as the cardiovascular system may be involved in any combination. Patients with urticaria and/or angioedema can be classified based on pathophysiologic mechanisms into those with IgE-dependent or complement-mediated immunologic disorders, those with nonimmunologic disorders in which there is a direct effect on the mast cell or on arachidonic acid metabolism, and those whose condition is idiopathic. Evaluation of patients should focus on a thorough history. Laboratory tests provide minimal additional information. About one half of patients with urticaria alone and 25% with urticaria and angioedema or angioedema alone are free of lesions within 1 year. With urticaria, angioedema, or both, 20% of patients experience episodes for more than 20 years. \nBreathing during sleep in patients treated for obstructive sleep apnea. Nasal CPAP for only part of the night. To determine whether long-term NCPAP therapy influences severity of sleep disordered breathing during the second part of a night when NCPAP is applied for only the first four hours of sleep, we studied 21 patients with OSA receiving NCPAP therapy for 253 +/- 41.6 days. Results from polysomnography for the period after withdrawal from NCPAP (night B) were compared to the corresponding period of sleep prior to initiation of NCPAP therapy (night A). There was no significant change in RDI from night A (53.9 +/- 8.6) to night B (28.7 +/- 3.3), but maximal apnea length diminished from 55 +/- 2.9 s to 40 +/- 2.9 s (p less than 0.05). Whereas daytime Po2 and the amplitude of desaturations during sleep remained equal, overall oxygenation during sleep improved slightly (mean SaO2 night A = 90.6 +/- 0.9 percent; night B = 92.8 +/- 0.5 percent; p less than 0.05). Differences between nights A and B were more prominent the more severe sleep apnea had been prior to treatment and could not be explained by weight loss. There was strong correlation between improvements in oxygenation measurements and the daily time of NCPAP use. In conclusion, we found a subgroup of OSA patients receiving long-term NCPAP therapy with less disturbed ventilation during sleep following use of NCPAP for only the first part of the night, but in the majority of patients, sleep disordered breathing off NCPAP remained unchanged. \nSynchronous lung cancers defined by deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry. When two pulmonary tumors are seen simultaneously in patients with lung cancer, it always raises a question as to whether the lesions are synchronous lung cancers or lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis. To settle this issue, we used deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry. Deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy patterns of tumors were able to be analyzed in 14 patients with two simultaneous pulmonary tumors resected by operation. These two tumors, with completely different patterns of deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy, were defined as synchronous lung cancers. Tumors were defined as lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis when both tumors showed diploidy or when at least one deoxyribonucleic acid index of abnormal clones between two aneuploid tumors was the same or almost identical. Tumors of the five patients with stage I disease were classified as synchronous lung cancers according to the criteria involving deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry. Both tumors were adenocarcinomas in four patients and large-cell and squamous cell carcinomas in one. Both tumors in four patients were located in the same lobe but different segments. All but one patient with different histologic types are alive without recurrence from 24 to 100 months after operation. Tumors of the nine patients with stage III disease in whom intrapulmonary metastasis was clinically suspected were classified as lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis according to the criteria. These data suggest that deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry of tumors may have diagnostic value in determining synchronous lung cancers. \nInferior vena caval involvement by renal cell carcinoma. Use of venovenous bypass as adjunct during resection. Venovenous bypass allows the safe conduct of operation during resection of renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval involvement by allowing venous return when the inferior vena cava is clamped, thus preventing hypotension. It obviates the heparin required for full cardiopulmonary bypass and therefore decreases postoperative bleeding. A blood retrieval system decreases the volume of banked blood required. A Moretz clip placed early on the intrapericardial inferior vena cava allows adequate venous return and prevents a massive pulmonary tumor embolism. \nAortoesophageal fistula: a comprehensive review of the literature. Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is a relatively rare but life-threatening cause of upper gastro-intestinal bleeding. The clinical characteristics of AEF are so unique that a presumptive bedside diagnosis can be made at the time of presentation. In the past decade, surgical management has improved to the point that cure is now possible. For these reasons, we have reviewed the literature. We summarize our findings with respect to the etiology and clinical characteristics of AEF. Further, we discuss the diagnostic modalities that may be used to confirm the diagnosis, and the therapeutic modalities available to slow the hemorrhage, so as to allow time to correct the anatomic defect. \nMetastases of a gastric adenocarcinoma presenting as colonic polyposis. Report of a case. The authors report a case of multiple colonic metastases of a gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, presenting as colonic polyposis revealed by diarrhea, iron deficiency anemia, and left supraclavicular lymph node. \nPlacenta previa percreta involving the urinary bladder: a report of two cases and review of the literature. The incidences of both placenta previa and placenta accreta are increased in patients with scarred uteri, and patients with uterine scars and placenta previa are at increased risk for also having placenta accreta. Two cases are presented of placenta previa percreta with involvement of the urinary bladder necessitating cesarean hysterectomy, partial cystectomy, and, in one case, bilateral ureteral reimplantation. Both patients had two previous cesarean deliveries. Serious hemorrhage is common in patients with placenta percreta. The primary goal of surgical management must be to control bleeding, which usually requires resection of all tissue involved by the infiltrating placenta. After hemorrhage is controlled, the surgeon must reestablish the integrity of the urinary system and reconstruct the pelvis as necessary. \nPorencephalic cyst: a complication of fetal intravascular transfusion. A case of unilateral porencephalic cyst as a result of intravascular intrauterine transfusion is reported. Although other factors may have contributed, fetal bradycardia and relative hyperviscosity as a result of increased fetal hematocrit value were considered to be related to this event. Because some authors recommend direct intravascular transfusion to supraphysiologic hematocrits to prolong the interval between procedures, we would caution the use of this approach on the basis of theoretic considerations and the occurrence of this complication. \nSuppressive effect of sulfate on the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the sulfate ion on blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertension, which involves increased sympathetic nervous activity. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups, and received one of the following drinking solutions: distilled water [control], 171 mmol/L sodium chloride [NaCl group], 171 mmol/L sodium chloride plus 12 mmol/L magnesium sulfate [S(+) group], or 171 mmol/L sodium chloride plus 12 mmol/L magnesium chloride [S(-) group]. In the S(+) group, the elevation of systolic blood pressure (SBP; mm Hg) was significantly attenuated (168 +/- 17 v 213 +/- 26, P less than .005) and intraerythrocyte calcium concentration (R-Ca; mumol/L cells) was significantly lower (11.5 +/- 3.0 v 17.4 +/- 6.5, P less than .05) than in the S(-) group. The cardiac norepinephrine content (H-NE; ng/100 g tissue) of the S(+) group was significantly lower than that of the S(-) group. SBP was correlated negatively with H-NE (r = -0.70, P less than .001) and positively with R-Ca (r = 0.45, P less than .005). R-Ca was negatively correlated with H-NE (r = -0.36, P less than .05). These results suggest that the replacement of chloride with sulfate ion suppresses the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt rats at least in part by its inhibitory effect on sympathetic nervous activity through the decreased intracellular calcium concentration. \nPhysiologic stress and cellular ischemia: relationship to immunosuppression and susceptibility to sepsis. Multiple organ system failure secondary to infection is the most frequent cause of late mortality after hemorrhage, burns, and trauma. Although multiple immunologic abnormalities have been identified following injury, blood loss, and tissue ischemia, the mechanisms that produce these alterations in T- and B-cell function have not been completely defined. Physiologic stress and ischemia result in increased release of neuroendocrine peptides and hormones, capable of affecting normal neuroendocrine-immunologic balance and producing immunosuppression. Tissue ischemia leads to increased expression of heat shock proteins by hypoperfused cells, which can alter T-cell function. Injury also is followed by the appearance of serum immunosuppressive factors, which have been shown to inhibit T- and B-cell function. Future therapies directed at these and other cellular and molecular abnormalities initiated by tissue hypoperfusion may reverse the immunosuppressed state in critically ill patients and lead to improved outcome in this setting. \nMetachronous occurrence of collagenous colitis and ulcerative colitis. Collagenous colitis and ulcerative colitis are distinct disorders. A 67 year old woman with clinical and histological evidence of collagenous colitis had an abrupt symptomatic exacerbation while taking anti-inflammatory treatment with sulphasalazine and prednisone. Repeat colorectal endoscopy showed active mucosal inflammation and colonic biopsy specimens were consistent with active ulcerative colitis. After bowel rest, total parenteral nutrition, intensification of the anti-inflammatory regimen, and withdrawal of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (which she had taken continuously for osteoarthritis) diarrhoea abated. Colorectal biopsy specimens obtained when the patient's symptoms had improved showed inactive ulcerative colitis with no evidence of collagenous colitis. This may be the first case to be reported of the metachronous association of collagenous and ulcerative colitis. \nThe use of aspirin to prevent heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty. A preliminary report. The reported incidence of heterotopic ossification (HO) after total hip arthroplasty (THA) ranges up to 50%. HO causes pain and restricted range of motion (ROM) in a significant number of these THA patients. From 1983 to 1988, 177 primary cemented THAs were performed in 131 consecutive patients. Six hundred fifty milligrams of buffered aspirin administered twice daily for two weeks was used as a prophylaxis for thromboembolic disease. There was an unusually low incidence of HO in this group of patients. Aspirin treatment was instituted the night before surgery and continued for two weeks, except in 13 patients (7%) who had to stop treatment because of gastrointestinal symptoms. All patients had at least one year of roentgenographic study postoperatively. According to the Brooker Classification of HO, there were 169 (96%) Grade I and Grade 0 hips, six (3%) Grade II, two (1%) Grade III, and no Grade IV. None of the patients had symptomatic restriction of ROM attributable to heterotopic bone. Aspirin is a safe and inexpensive agent for prevention of HO after THA. \nSalvage of thrombosed forearm polytetrafluoroethylene vascular access grafts by reversal of flow direction and venous bypass grafting. A technique is described for salvage of looped forearm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular access grafts that fail because of thrombosis due to cephalic vein outflow obstruction. It entails reversal of blood flow direction through the graft and construction of a new venous outflow in the medial upper arm. This procedure was performed in nine patients and, at the present time, has increased the graft life by an average of 6.2 months (range: 2 to 14 months) in eight. We conclude that this is a useful alternative to abandoning failed looped forearm PTFE grafts that have cephalic vein outflow obstruction. \nHigh rate of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with esophageal varices and idiopathic portal hypertension. Data on 126 consecutive patients who were admitted to our clinics from January 1979 to May 1989 were scrut",
