        "text": " Early recognition of electromechanical dissociation may improve care and outcome. Cardiac stun syndrome can be treated successfully with ECMO. \nComplete infarction of the eye complicating a choroidal malignant melanoma. Infarction of malignant melanoma of the choroid has been previously reported, but infarction of the whole eye in association with infarction of melanoma is a rare event that has not been previously described. We present such a case and discuss the possible pathogenesis. \nManagement of hypertensive emergencies: changing therapeutic options. Rapid lowering of severe hypertension is essential to prevent irreversible damage to vital organs. The patient's clinical status should be evaluated, noting particularly cardiac, neurologic, and renal functions. Choice of treatment should be based on speed and efficacy of action and on hemodynamic, vascular, and renal consequences. It is also important to preserve circulatory homeostasis and vital organ function. Sodium nitroprusside, labetalol, diazoxide, and hydralazine have been used parenterally for rapid control of severe hypertension, but they do not always produce optimal, balanced hemodynamic effects. Calcium antagonists have been advocated because of their beneficial circulatory effects. Nicardipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, produces significant antihypertensive effects, and when given intravenously, results in a rapid fall in blood pressure. Studies have confirmed that nicardipine is effective and safe in the management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises. Because the aim of rapidly controlling severe hypertension is to prevent target organ dysfunction, nicardipine therapy offers a useful additional option in the clinical management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises. \nClinical characteristics and surgical management of vascular complications in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization: interventional versus diagnostic procedures. The purpose of this report is to define the clinical characteristics and outcome of surgical management of vascular complications after interventional cardiac catheterization and to contrast them to those after diagnostic cardiac catheterization. From October 1985 to December 1989, 101 patients were treated for 106 vascular complications after 1866 interventional and 5046 diagnostic cardiac catheterizations at the University of Michigan Medical Center. Interventional catheterizations resulted in 69 vascular complications in 64 patients (frequency 3.4%). The most common interventions included coronary angioplasty (34), of which 10 required percutaneous partial cardiopulmonary bypass, intraaortic balloon pump placement (14), and aortic valvuloplasty (11). Interventional catheter-related complications included hemorrhage (33), arterial thrombosis (18), pseudoaneurysm formation (12), catheter embolization (2), thromboembolism (2), as well as arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm, and arterial dissection (1 each). Fifteen of these 69 patients (24%) had suffered acute myocardial infarction just before their catheterization. Surgical repair was performed under local anesthesia in 70% of patients. Major vascular reconstructions were required in 9% of patients. Three percent of the involved lower extremities had to be amputated because of complications occurring after arterial puncture. Eight percent of the patients incurring vascular complications after interventional procedures died after operation. Diagnostic catheterizations resulted in 37 vascular complications in 37 patients (frequency 0.7%). In contrast to diagnostic cardiac catheterization, vascular complications after interventional cardiac catheterization occurred more frequently, were most often due to hemorrhage at the vascular access site, and occurred in high-risk, critically ill patients. \nStaving off acute otitis media. When is prophylaxis with antibiotics desirable? Acute otitis media affects most young children and is the condition for which children are most frequently treated with antibiotics. A pattern of recurrent acute ear infections develops in some children and is a source of frustration for parents and physicians. Recurrent episodes can exacerbate asthma or other underlying medical problems, and long-term effects can include chronic otitis media with permanent middle-ear injury and, possibly, delay in psychomotor and language development. Antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the number of episodes of acute otitis media in children at high risk for recurrent infection. There is no perfect antibiotic to prevent acute otitis media. However, the risks associated with the drugs described in this article are low. Prophylaxis with antibiotics does not prevent all episodes of acute otitis media but can reduce the number of episodes by 50%. \nThe mechanism responsible for diminished neutrophil production in neonates delivered of women with pregnancy-induced hypertension. The neonatal neutropenia after pregnancy-induced hypertension is a function of diminished neutrophil production. These studies test the hypothesis that this diminution is due to decreased production of neutrophilic growth factors, reduced responsiveness of neutrophil progenitors to these factors, or the presence of an inhibitor. While the concentrations of placentally derived colony-stimulating factors were similar in normotensive and hypertensive gestations, bioassay demonstrated less colony-stimulating activity in placental conditioned media from hypertensive gestations. Evaluation of the responsiveness of progenitors to recombinant factors revealed no differences between those from normotensive and hypertensive gestations. However, neutrophilic colony formation in vitro was significantly inhibited after the addition of conditioned media or sera from hypertensive gestations, whereas the addition of these from normotensive gestations had no inhibitory effect. Thus this common maternal-fetal disorder is associated with an inhibitor of neutrophil production, which is elaborated by the placenta and present in cord blood serum. \nTransient white matter changes on MR images in children undergoing chemotherapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia: correlation with neuropsychologic deficiencies. The cranial magnetic resonance (MR) images of 25 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) who were undergoing chemotherapy were retrospectively studied to determine the frequency of white matter changes and to analyze the significance of these observed changes in predicting subsequent neuropsychologic deficiencies. MR images showed transient white matter abnormalities in 17 of the 25 patients during consolidation therapy. Twelve of 20 children showed neuropsychologic deficits. There was no correlation between white matter changes and neuropsychologic deficits. In the subgroup of children under age 5 years at the time of diagnosis, 10 of 11 showed neuropsychologic deficits, and eight of 11 had white matter changes. Children under age 5 who undergo chemotherapy for ALL are at high risk to develop neuropsychologic deficiencies. Age at diagnosis is a reliable predictor of subsequent neuropsychologic deficits. \nThe risk of axillofemoral bypass grafting for acute vascular occlusion. The hypothesis of the present study is that axillofemoral bypass grafting for acute vascular occlusion has results significantly inferior to an elective procedure. We reviewed 53 patients undergoing primary axillofemoral bypass grafting at the University of Virginia from 1984 to 1989. We found that patients who were admitted with acute vascular occlusion had a higher incidence of perioperative complications (63% vs 26%, p = 0.001), perioperative mortality (26% vs 3%, p less than 0.05), lower graft patency at 1 year (60% vs 90%, p less than 0.05), lower rate of freedom from reoperation in first year (50% vs 82%, p less than 0.01), and lower rates of limb salvage (76% vs 94%, p less than 0.05) than patients undergoing axillofemoral bypass grafting for chronic symptoms or conditions. These two groups did not differ in any of the other risk factors or perioperative characteristics examined. We conclude axillofemoral bypass grafting performed for indications other than acute vascular occlusion is associated with acceptable morbidity, mortality, graft patency, and limb salvage rates. \nNa+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition and intracellular electrolyte content in essential and secondary hypertension. A crucial role of humoral factors in the pathogenesis of primary hypertension is discussed. In 1982 Hamlyn et al demonstrated the presence of a Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibitor in the plasma of essential hypertensives and showed a significant correlation of the Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition with the blood pressure. In this study we examined whether an Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibitor could be found in the blood of essential hypertensives as compared to patients with secondary hypertension (renal hypertension, renal artery stenosis, pheochromocytoma). Second, the possible correlation between an inhibition of Na+, K(+)-ATPase and the intracellular electrolyte composition was examined. The results demonstrate a similar reduction of Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition in both essential hypertensives and secondary hypertensives as compared to normotensive controls. Further, the intracellular electrolyte composition (Na+, Na; K+, Ca) does not show a significant correlation to the degree of Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition, whereas a significant correlation between the degree of Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition and intracellular Cl- concentration could be demonstrated. The present study shows that an endogenous Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibitor is also present in secondary forms of hypertension, thus implying that a specific role in the pathogenesis of primary hypertension for an Na+, K(+)-inhibitor is unlikely. \nOral rehydration therapy for invasive diarrhea. Current guidelines for the management of diarrheal diseases focus on the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT). Clinically evident dehydration of a moderate degree is not uncommon with invasive diarrhea, and when it occurs, the response to ORT is satisfactory. Studies from hospitals and the community each document the effectiveness of ORT for rehydration of patients with invasive diarrhea. This has been confirmed in a clinical trial of oral rehydration solution (ORS) for the treatment of diarrheal diseases in children less than 5 years of age. Children with moderate dehydration benefited most from ORS, especially those who had culture-proven invasive diarrhea. Significant early weight gain was observed for this group of patients alone after rehydration with ORS. In developing countries, there is no reason to withhold ORT at the first signs of watery or dysenteric diarrhea regardless of the cause and independent of the decision to treat the patient with antimicrobial agents. \nPrior poliomyelitis-reduced capillary supply and metabolic enzyme content in hypertrophic slow-twitch (type I) muscle fibres. Capillary supply and oxidative and glycolytic enzyme activities were determined in muscle biopsies from the tibialis anterior muscle in six prior polio patients and a control group. The polio patients, who had paresis and atrophy, but were able to walk normally by making maximal use of all remaining anterior tibial motor units, showed type I (slow-twitch) muscle fibre predominance with a mean (SD) of 98 (2%) type I fibres versus 81 (8)% in the controls (p less than 0.01) and muscle fibre hypertrophy, the average type I fibre cross-sectional area being 108% (p less than 0.005) larger than in the controls. The number of capillaries per muscle fibre was not significantly different from that in the control group, but with the increased muscle fibre area in the polio patients, the capillary density was significantly lower. The number of capillaries in contact with type I fibres relative to fibre area was 40% lower in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.005). The levels of citrate synthase and phosphofructokinase were significantly lower (38% and 33%, respectively, p less than 0.05) in the patients than in the controls, indicating decreased oxidative and glycolytic potentials in the muscle fibres of the polio patients. It is proposed that the abnormal high-frequency activation of all remaining motor units during each step cycle recorded in these patients constitutes a stimulus for type I muscle fibre predominance and hypertrophy but that the overall low muscle usage results in a decreased stimulation of capillary proliferation and mitochondrial enzyme synthesis. \nThe herpes simplex virus 1 segment inversion site is specifically cleaved by a virus-induced nuclear endonuclease. Nuclear extracts from several tissue culture cell lines (human, primate, and murine) contain an endonuclease that specifically cleaves sequences at the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) segment inversion site. Mapping studies identified the preferential site of cleavage as a set of tandemly repeated dodecamers, the DR2 repeats. Endonuclease levels vary according to the proliferative state of the cell; little or no activity is detectable in extracts from quiescent cells, whereas high levels are expressed in dividing cells. Also, infection of density-arrested BSC-1 cells with HSV-1 induces a substantial increase (at least 35-fold) in endonucleolytic activity, which is first detectable at about 1 hr after infection at 32 degrees C. The elevated levels of enzyme activity then persist throughout the viral life cycle. In addition to the HSV-1 DR2 repeats, certain other G+C-rich sequences with an asymmetric distribution of purines and pyrimidines on the DNA strands and with appropriate sequences and lengths are substrates for the nuclease. These data indicate that target site recognition by the enzyme is conformation specific rather than sequence specific. \nAdrenal cortical carcinoma with vena cava tumor thrombus requiring cardiopulmonary bypass for resection. We believe this is the fifteenth case report of adrenal cortical carcinoma with tumor thrombus to the vena cava, and the fourth reported case of a left-side tumor propagating thrombus to the vena cava. The patient underwent successful resection which required cardiopulmonary bypass. The caval tumor thrombus was very friable and gelatinous, unlike many renal cell thrombi, and required special surgical considerations. \nBleeding after endoscopic sphincterotomy as an underestimated entity. Hemorrhage is the most frequent complication of endoscopic sphincterotomy, with a reported incidence of 2 to 9 per cent. Previous reports have generally defined this complication clinically, leaving the issue of occult bleeding after sphincterotomy essentially unaddressed. Seventy-five serial sphincterotomies were reviewed to further assess this complication. Nine patients had clinically evident hemorrhage and 27 patients had occult bleeding manifested only by a decrement in hematologic parameters, for a total postsphincterotomy bleeding rate of 48 per cent. No statistically significant risk factors for bleeding were delineated. Endoscopically recognized bleeding at the time of the sphincterotomy was 47 per cent sensitive and 85 per cent specific in predicting postprocedural bleeding. Significant delayed hemorrhage was manifest in three patients, one of whom had clinically occult bleeding. We conclude that bleeding complicates endoscopic sphincterotomy much more frequently than previously reported, although often in a clinically occult manner. Significant delayed bleeding can occur, and may not be clinically apparent. Bleeding recognized endoscopically at the time of sphincterotomy is an insensitive but relatively specific predictor of postprocedural bleeding. As use of endoscopic sphincterotomy increases, careful surveillance for hemorrhagic complications, as well as efforts to identify factors predisposing to the same, will be of increasing importance. \nBlood-brain barrier disruption after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in immature swine. We investigated blood-brain barrier permeability in 2-3-week-old anesthetized pigs during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We assessed permeability by tissue uptake of radiolabeled aminoisobutyric acid, after correcting for plasma counts in tissue with radiolabeled inulin. Among 14 regions examined, the transfer coefficient of aminoisobutyric acid in nonischemic control animals ranged from 0.0018 +/- 0.0001 ml/g/min in diencephalon to 0.0049 +/- 0.0003 ml/g/min in cervical spinal cord. After 8 minutes of cardiac arrest followed by either 10 or 40 minutes of continuous sternal compression, there was no increase in the transfer coefficient. Likewise, during the immediate period after ventricular defibrillation, there was no increase in transfer coefficient despite the brief, transient hypertension. However, after 8 minutes of arrest, 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 4 hours of spontaneous circulation, the transfer coefficient was significantly increased by 59-107% in 10 of 11 regions rostral to the pons. Plasma volume in tissue measured by inulin was not elevated, suggesting that the increased transfer coefficient was not due to increased surface area. Thus, after an 8-minute period of complete ischemia, the blood-brain barrier remains intact during and immediately after resuscitation despite large vascular pressure fluctuations. However, in contrast to previous work on adult dogs, immature pigs are prone to a delayed increase in permeability, thereby allowing circulating substances greater access to the brain. \nAnkle arthrodesis. A comparison of internal and external fixation. The authors reviewed the results of ankle arthrodesis in 68 ankles in 66 patients. The average follow-up period of the patients was five years (range, two to ten years). There were 40 ankles in which internal fixation was used and 28 ankles in which external fixation was used. The two groups were compared to determine the effect of mode of stabilization on outcome. Outcome was measured by time to union, development of complications, and clinical follow-up result. The groups were similar in regards to gender, age, and preoperative diagnosis. The external fixation group had a significantly higher prevalence of complications, including non-union, delayed union, and infection, than the internal fixation group. It was concluded that ankle arthrodesis with internal fixation is better tolerated and has fewer complications than techniques that use external fixation. \nDouble-blind controlled study of botulinum toxin in adductor spasmodic dysphonia. The treatment of adductor spasmodic dysphonia using botulinum toxin A was conducted in 13 patients as a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were diagnosed independently by an interdisciplinary team consisting of speech pathologists, an otolaryngologist, and a neurologist. The toxin or saline was injected into each thyroarytenoid muscle under electromyographic and laryngoscopic guidance. Botulinum toxin A markedly reduced perturbation, decreased fundamental frequency range, and improved the spectrographic characteristics of the voice. Fundamental frequency and phonation time remained unchanged. Patients injected with botulinum toxin A noticed significant improvement in their voices in comparison with the placebo-treated group. Excessive breathiness of the voice occurred in two patients, and mild bleeding in one patient in the botulinum toxin A-treated group. Injection with saline resulted in edema of the vocal cord in one patient. Botulinum toxin A proved to be an effective and safe treatment of adductor spasmodic dysphonia. \nUsefulness of the nude mouse model in mesothelioma based on a direct patient-xenograft comparison. A patient with malignant mesothelioma experienced tumor recurrence 3 months after pleuropneumonectomy. Samples of the tumor were transplanted into nude mice to assess chemosensitivity. There was close concordance between the results in xenografts and the clinical outcome in this patient. Both mitomycin and to a lesser extent cisplatin were effective as single agents against the nude mouse xenografts, and the combination of these two drugs produced a complete response both in the patient and in the xenografts. The patient survived 18 months from onset of chemotherapy and 24 months from diagnosis. The duration of clinical complete response to chemotherapy was 14 months, despite the fact that mitomycin, the most effective agent against the xenografts, was discontinued after only two cycles because the patient developed pulmonary toxicity. This direct patient-xenograft correlation further validates the usefulness of the nude mouse model in the search for effective therapies for malignant mesothelioma, a tumor characterized by frequent refractoriness to most available agents. \nCombination antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease. We compared the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of two broad-spectrum combination antimicrobial regimens in the treatment of 148 patients with acute pelvic inflammatory disease. Patients were randomized to inpatient treatment with either cefoxitin and doxycycline (n = 75) or clindamycin and tobramycin (n = 73). These antibiotics were administered intravenously for at least 4 days, and up to 48 hours beyond defervescence. Patients were discharged on a regimen of oral doxycycline or clindamycin in accordance with the intravenous regimen to complete a total duration of therapy of 2 weeks. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (53%) and Chlamydia trachomatis (31%) were the microorganisms that were isolated most frequently from the genital tract of enrolled patients. At follow-up, N. gonorrhoeae was isolated in two patients, and C. trachomatis was isolated in none. The overall initial favorable response rate to combination antimicrobial therapy was 98.5% (130/132) in patients with uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease and 81% (13/16) in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease that was complicated by tuboovarian abscess. A greater than 70% decrease in abdominal tenderness score occurred in 89% of 111 patients within 6 weeks of hospital discharge. There were no significant differences between antibiotic treatment groups in any response categories or in toxicity. During the initial hospitalization, five patients (three with tuboovarian abscess; one with a pyosalpinx, and one with intractable acute and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease) required surgical intervention. These results support the recommendation to use broad-spectrum combination antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease. \nPsychological changes accompanying non-pharmacological treatment of chronic headache: the effects of outcome. Several prior studies suggest that non-drug treatment for chronic headache is accompanied by concomitant reductions in patients' anxiety, depression and somatization. It is currently unclear, however, whether such beneficial side effects are a function of degree of headache relief or are due simply to receiving treatment. Most work to date in this area has treated outcome as a dichotomous variable. The present report employed a regression approach which treats outcome (degree of headache relief) as a continuous variable in the study of 149 chronic headache patients and their accompanying psychological changes. Anxiety and depression were significantly reduced for headache patients regardless of degree of headache relief. With somatization, however, degree of headache relief had a significant effect; the greater the reduction in headache, the fewer somatic concerns were expressed, especially for mixed headache. \nSubcutaneous metoclopramide in the treatment of symptomatic gastroparesis: clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics. We investigated the safety and efficacy of short-term s.c. administration of metoclopramide in the treatment of symptomatic gastric stasis. Ten patients with gastroparesis, documented by abnormal solid phase radionuclide gastric emptying study, were treated with 10 mg (2 ml) of s.c. metoclopramide every 6 hr for 3 days. Patients gave themselves the injections as outpatients. Questionnaires were then completed concerning symptom relief, local side effects and adverse reactions. A repeat gastric emptying study was obtained immediately after the last dose of metoclopramide. Serum metoclopramide concentrations were obtained at trough, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hr postadministration and serum prolactin levels at trough, 1 and 3 hr. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed mean peak metoclopramide concentration at 30 min of 99.7 +/- 47.1 ng/ml with measured levels of 93.9 +/- 106.83 ng/ml at 60 min and return to trough values by 4 hr; trough prolactins remained elevated above normal values. Gastric stasis improved from a base-line retention of 78.7% of radioisotope at 2 hr to 72.5% after 3 days of therapy (P = .65). Eight patients reported significant improvement in symptomology and two patients reported lessening of symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, heartburn and vomiting. The side effects were minimal and did not interfere with completion of the protocol. We demonstrated that s.c. administration of metoclopramide was well accepted by patients and resulted in subjective and objective improvement of gastric stasis. In addition, serum metoclopramide concentrations were comparable with other parenteral routes of administration. Furthermore, serum prolactin levels may provide both a bioassay of efficacy and a marker for monitoring compliance. \nDisseminated histoplasmosis in a renal transplant patient: a cause of renal failure several years following transplantation. A 49-year-old man developed disseminated histoplasmosis 6 1/2 years after transplantation. The organism was initially present in the urine and in a tongue lesion. Treatment with itraconazole was instituted. However, there was further dissemination of the disease and worsening of renal function. Allograft biopsy showed extensive involvement with the organism. Amphotericin B was started, resulting in a rapid resolution of the disease. However, renal function deteriorated, leading to permanent hemodialysis. \nDietary risk factors associated with acute and persistent diarrhea in children in Karachi, Pakistan. Feeding practices may have an important impact on diarrheal diseases in developing countries. This study evaluated feeding practices in three groups of male children aged 6-36 mo: 100 with persistent diarrhea (PD), 79 with acute diarrhea (AD), and 86 in a comparison group (CG). The children came from comparably poor socioeconomic settings in Karachi, Pakistan, except that the literacy rates were higher in mothers of the CG (P = 0.0001). Although greater than 95% of all infants were breast-fed, delayed initiation of breast-feeding was more common in the diarrhea groups. Children with diarrhea were also more likely to receive supplemental milk (PD = 92%, AD = 87%) than were children in the CG (69%, P less than 0.05). Feedings were not withheld during diarrhea but changes were made in the nature of foods given. These results indicate that several feeding practices may be important risk factors for diarrhea in Pakistan. \nAdenocarcinoma of urinary bladder: classification and management. Adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder is an uncommon, often aggressive urologic cancer. In an attempt to classify and define management of this tumor, 28 patients with vesical adenocarcinoma were studied. Excluded were patients with mixed transitional cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Three major classes of tumor were identified: primary vesical adenocarcinoma, urachal adenocarcinoma, and extravesical adenocarcinoma involving the bladder. Signet ring cell tumors appeared to behave more aggressively than other cell types. Radical surgery was the most effective treatment. \nThe role of platelets, thrombin and hyperplasia in restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Coronary angioplasty has become a successful and widely used treatment for patients with coronary artery disease since its first clinical application in 1977. The primary success rate has improved despite the increase in procedure and case complexity. However, acute reocclusion and late restenosis, which constitute the most important problems after successful angioplasty, continue to occur in about 5% and 35% of patients within 3 to 6 months, respectively. Angioscopic and pathologic observations have suggested that a multifactorial pathophysiologic process accounts for acute reocclusion, involving marked thrombosis, intimal dissection, medial and subintimal hemorrhage, vascular recoil and vasocontriction. In contrast, chronic restenosis involves the development of fibrocellular intimal hyperplasia within a milieu created by vascular injury, platelet activation, thrombin generation and the release of mitogens. Although current pharmacologic approaches, which involve antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy, have been largely ineffective in eliminating acute reocclusion and chronic restenosis, recent advances in the research in thrombosis, platelet receptors and smooth muscle growth regulation have allowed new therapeutic options to be tested in the experimental setting, with subsequent potential clinical applications in patients. \nThe Washington University-Barnes Hospital experience with lung transplantation. Washington University Lung Transplantation Group OBJECTIVE.--To review our experience with lung transplantation, emphasizing recipient selection, choice of procedure, functional results, and outcome. DESIGN.--Retrospective review of patients who received lung transplants at Barnes Hospital, St Louis, Mo, between July 1, 1988, and January 31, 1991. SETTING.--Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Mo, and Barnes Hospital, a medical school and its affiliated referral hospital, respectively. PATIENTS.--Sixty-nine lung transplant procedures were performed in 66 recipients. Patients with clinically and physiologically severe lung disease were selected according to predetermined guidelines. Underlying diseases in the recipients included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency emphysema, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's syndrome associated with an atrial septal defect, bronchiectasis, eosinophilic granuloma, and lymphangiomyomatosis. INTERVENTION.--Double-lung, bilateral sequential, and single-lung transplantations were performed. Eight patients underwent en bloc double-lung transplantations or a modification of this procedure with separate bronchial anastomoses. Thereafter, the bilateral sequential approach to replacement of both lungs was performed in 26 patients. Thirty-two patients underwent single-lung transplantations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas levels, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and actuarial survival. RESULTS.--Actuarial survival at 1 year for the 66 lung transplant recipients was 79%. Actuarial survival at 1 year was 82% for the bilateral lung transplant recipients and was 90% for the single-lung transplant recipients. In patients with either restrictive or obstructive lung disease, pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas levels improved markedly after lung transplantation. In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger's syndrome, the pulmonary artery pressure decreased and the cardiac index increased into the normal range after single-lung transplantation. CONCLUSIONS.--In carefully selected patients with end-stage lung disease, single-lung and bilateral lung transplantations can significantly improve functional capacity, with promising early actuarial survival statistics after 1 year. \nEndothoracic endoesophageal pull-through operation. A new approach to cancers of the esophagus and proximal stomach. Many thoracic surgeons have expressed concern about the complications inherent in transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy. The technique of endothoracic endoesophageal pull-through uses a mucosal coring of normal esophagus beyond the tumor and leaves a muscular tube through which the substitute organ is passed. Mediastinal hemorrhage, tracheal injury, and chylothorax are eliminated. \nPellagra in a patient with an eating disorder. A case of pellagra is described that occurred in a patient with an eating disorder and who presented with marked photosensitivity and diarrhoea. We found urinary 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid to be low and suggest that this may be a useful screening test. To our knowledge this is only the second reported case of pellagra associated with an eating disorder. \nPerioperative stroke. Part II: Cardiac surgery and cardiogenic embolic stroke. The major mechanism of stroke in cardiac surgery is embolization. The risk is higher in intracardiac than in extracardiac surgery. The incidence of stoke associated with CABG is about 5%. The cerebral protective properties of isoflurane and thiopentone, acid-base management, and monitoring of cerebral perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass are discussed. Prophylactic carotid endarterectomy for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease before cardiac surgery is not necessary. Symptomatic carotid disease increases the risk of stroke, and the management of patients who have both symptomatic coronary and carotid artery diseases is discussed. Cardiogenic embolism is probably responsible for many perioperative strokes. Patients with atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, and prosthetic heart valves are at high risk of cardiogenic embolism. Strokes associated with cardioversion, pacemaker insertion, coronary arteriography and angioplasty are explored. \nDesirability of immediate surgical standby for coronary angioplasty. OBJECTIVE--To assess the value of emergency surgical standby for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. DESIGN--Retrospective review of the major complications of coronary angioplasty in a regional cardiac centre. SETTING--All angioplasties were performed in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory of Wythenshawe Hospital with surgical standby in an adjoining operating theatre. PATIENTS--1262 vessels were dilated in 1032 patients (mean age 53 years) between 1984 and 1989. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--In-hospital mortality from emergency surgical revascularisation after angioplasty; the rate of myocardial infarction and overall morbidity. RESULTS--Coronary angioplasty achieved primary success in 90% of cases. Thirty eight (3.7%) patients (five women (mean age 55.8) and 33 men (mean age 53.0] were referred for urgent surgical revascularisation--36 direct to operation and two within 24 hours. All patients survived surgery. Five of the 38 had had a previous angioplasty to the same vessel and one had had previous coronary artery grafts. Four of the 38 had an angioplasty for unstable angina. Eighteen had single, 13 double, and seven triple vessel coronary artery disease. The target vessel was the left anterior descending in 25, right coronary artery in nine, circumflex in three, and the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries in one. Five required external cardiac massage on the way to the operating theatre; two of them had a left main stem occlusion. Four internal mammary artery and 60 reversed saphenous vein grafts were implanted (1.6 per patient). Complete revascularisation was achieved in 36 (94.7%) patients. Q wave myocardial infarction occurred in six (15.8%). The final outcome was: none dead, three patients with angina, one late death, one cerebrovascular accident, one late operation for a new left anterior descending lesion, two patients on diuretics with or without an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. One orthotopic transplant was performed in a patient in whom cardiogenic shock developed after the left anterior descending coronary artery became occluded 72 hours after angioplasty. CONCLUSION--There was no surgical mortality and low morbidity among patients for whom immediate surgical cover was requested. \nRecurrent adnexal torsion and cystadenoma of aberrant ovarian tissue. Torsion of the adnexa is rare, and diagnosis is difficult because of the sparse clinical findings. I describe a patient with recurrent torsion of the right adnexa, involving a cystadenoma of aberrant ovarian tissue. Her only symptom was recurrent right-sided pelvic pain. \nLimitations of ultrasonography in surveillance of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. The repeatability, observer bias and instrument bias of aortic diameter measurement by ultrasonography, were investigated in ten patients with small (3-6 cm by computed tomography) infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The repeatability of maximum aortic diameter measurement by ultrasonography was much better for anterior-posterior than transverse diameter, with coefficients of repeatability 3.0-7.5 mm and 10-15 mm respectively. The repeatability of suprarenal aortic diameter measurement was poor. Surprisingly, maximum diameter using ultrasonography was larger than that using computed tomography, the difference being least for anterior-posterior measurements. At best a single, experienced observer, using the same instrument may provide aortic diameters using ultrasonography accurate to within 5 mm, but more commonly such aortic diameter is only accurate to within 8 mm. \nArgon beam coagulation is superior to conventional techniques in repair of experimental splenic injury. Present management of splenic trauma focuses on splenic preservation. However, conventional operative techniques for splenic salvage are time consuming and frequently ineffective. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of the argon beam coagulator (ABC) in the management of experimental splenic injury. Ten adult miniature pigs were randomized to treatment with either conventional surgical techniques (topical Surgicel, electrocautery, suture-ligation, digital pressure) or splenic repair with the ABC. Three standard splenic injuries were made in each pig: capsular avulsion, splenic laceration, and hemisplenectomy. The ABC was more effective in treating all three types of splenic injury. The time required to achieve hemostasis and total operative time were significantly less in the group treated with the ABC for all three types of splenic injuries (p less than 0.05, Student's t-test, two sided). Operative blood loss was significantly less in the group treated with ABC for avulsion and hemisplenectomy (p less than 0.05, Student's t-test, two sided). Recurrent bleeding was significantly higher in the group treated with conventional techniques (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test, two-sided). We conclude that the argon beam coagulator is more effective than conventional techniques in treating experimental splenic injuries. The ABC provides more rapid and reliable hemostasis. Clinical trials using the ABC for splenic injury are warranted. \nFactors relevant to preventing embolic stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. Whether or not to treat patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation with anticoagulants to prevent embolic stroke is a dilemma for physicians. If randomized trials, currently underway, demonstrate a beneficial effect, the dilemma will not be solved because not all of the relevant factors can be addressed by trials. We used current knowledge about non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation and a method of obtaining patient-derived weights for avoiding stroke from eight medically trained subjects, to determine the overall benefit of anticoagulants and to see what factors were relevant and what effect each might have in deciding whether to use anticoagulant therapy. Using standard assumptions, anticoagulants gave an expected benefit for all subjects. The expected benefit (expressed in terms of lives per 1000 saved due to anticoagulants) varied between 5.4 and 46.7. This benefit remained for all subjects when we did a sensitivity analysis for different rates of stroke prevented by anticoagulants and different rates of intracranial hemorrhage caused by anticoagulants. When we used different baseline rates of stroke and different impacts of major hemorrhagic complications the benefit disappeared for 3 and 4 subjects respectively. We found the factors that were most crucial to the decision will not be included in randomized trials; the weight that an individual would place on avoiding embolic stroke vs the risk of intracranial bleeding from anticoagulant therapy; and the rate of embolic stroke that could be expected for the subject at risk. Factors which will be measured in randomized trials, will change results less substantially: the increased risk of major hemorrhages; the proportion of strokes that could be prevented by treatment; the increase in risk of intracranial hemorrhage. This method of analysis suggests that for most patients anticoagulants are beneficial and that the most important factor in determining this result is the value that subjects put on different outcomes. \nSarcoplasmic reticulum-associated cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase activity in normal and failing human hearts. Sarcoplasmic reticulum-associated cAMP phosphodiesterase activity was examined in microsomes prepared from the left ventricular myocardium of eight heart transplant recipients with end-stage idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and six unmatched organ donors with normal cardiac function. At cAMP concentrations less than or equal to 1.0 microM, sarcoplasmic reticulum-associated cAMP phosphodiesterase activity was functionally homogeneous. cAMP phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited competitively by cGMP (Ki = 0.031 +/- 0.008 microM) and the cilostamide derivative OPC 3911 (Ki = 0.018 +/- 0.004 microM), but was essentially insensitive to rolipram. Vmax and Km were 781.7 +/- 109.2 nmol/mg per min and 0.188 +/- 0.031 microM, respectively, in microsomes prepared from nonfailing hearts and 793.9 +/- 68.9 nmol/mg per min and 0.150 +/- 0.027 microM in microsomes prepared from failing hearts. Microsomes prepared from nonfailing and failing hearts did not differ with respect to either the ratio of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity to ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation activity or the sensitivity of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity to inhibition by OPC 3911. These data suggest that the diminished inotropic efficacy of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in failing human hearts does not result from changes in the level, kinetic properties, or pharmacologic sensitivity of sarcoplasmic reticulum-associated cAMP phosphodiesterase activity. \nErythropoietin deficiency in acute crescentic glomerulonephritis and in total bilateral renal cortical necrosis. Six patients with acute renal failure, in five cases due to acute crescentic glomerulonephritis and in one case due to total bilateral renal cortical necrosis, were studied. All had serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations in the normal range, despite a relatively severe anaemia. Half-life and plasma clearance of intravenously injected recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) were determined. The results indicate that the lack of compensatory increase in serum EPO to the anaemic stimulus is not due to increased catabolism, but to decreased synthesis of the renal hormone. Two patients were treated with rhEPO (Eprex). In marked contrast to untreated controls, both patients responded with vigorous reticulocytosis and normalization of haemoglobin levels while they were still in severe renal failure. These results are similar to our previous findings in patients with acute renal failure due to tubular necrosis. Under all three conditions the defective EPO synthesis is probably the dominant pathogenetic factor for the largely aregeneratory anaemia of prolonged cases, and for the sluggish restoration of red cell mass during recovery of renal function. It is concluded that defective synthesis of EPO is not only a permanent and irreversible feature of severe chronic renal failure, but that it is also present, usually in a transient and reversible form, in different types of acute renal failure. \nChronic sialadenitis with psammoma bodies mimicking neoplasia in a fine-needle aspiration specimen from the submandibular gland. A 65-year-old woman with a submandibular gland nodule had a fine-needle aspiration specimen that contained groups of duct-type cells and a psammoma body, suggestive of adenocarcinoma. The resected gland showed chronic sialadenitis with sialolithiasis and psammoma bodies. In a series of 81 resected nonneoplastic submandibular glands from 72 patients, psammoma bodies, nonlaminated microcalcifications, or both were found in 46 (57%). They were located most commonly just outside of striated or intercalated ducts. When examining fine-needle aspiration specimens from the submandibular gland, it is important that one be aware that psammoma bodies may occur in normal, inflamed, irradiated, and neoplastic conditions. \nDeficits in strategy application following frontal lobe damage in man. A quantitative investigation of the ability to carry out a variety of cognitive tasks was performed in 3 patients who had sustained traumatic injuries which involved prefrontal structures. All 3 had severe difficulties in 2 tests which required them to carry out a number of fairly simple but open-ended tasks over a 15-30 min period. They typically spent too long on individual tasks. All patients scored well on tests of perception, language and intelligence and 2 performed well on a variety of other tests of frontal lobe function. Explanations for their difficulty on the multiple subgoal tasks in terms of memory or motivational problems could be excluded. It is argued that the problem arose from an inability to reactivate after a delay previously-generated intentions when they are not directly signalled by the stimulus situation. \nDescending thoracic aortofemoral bypass as an alternative for aortoiliac revascularization. We performed descending thoracic aorta to femoral bypass in six selected patients over the past four years. An alternative inflow source was selected because the standard transabdominal approach was contraindicated or considered hazardous. The inflow consisted of a single Dacron tube from the descending thoracic aorta to the left groin, and a femorofemoral bypass to the right groin. There was no operative mortality or major morbidity related to the surgical procedure. After an average follow-up of 17.1 months (range 6 to 23 months), all thoracofemoral grafts remained patent. One patient had repeated occlusions of the femorofemoral graft related to right lower extremity outflow disease, while the remaining five crossover grafts are patent. One patient died 22 months postoperatively from a myocardial infarct, with a patent bypass. Although this series represents a small group of patients, we feel that descending thoracic aortofemoral bypass offers excellent inflow and reliable patency, and is a good alternative when reoperation on the abdominal aorta is undesirable. This procedure may also be considered for conversion of an axillofemoral bypass that has failed repeatedly. \nThe European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS): results by arterial distribution. The European Stroke Prevention Study was a multicenter study comparing the effect of the combination of dipyridamole, 75 mg, and acetylsalicylic acid, 330 mg, three times a day, to that of placebo in 2,500 patients in the secondary prevention of stroke or death after one or more transient ischemic attacks, reversible ischemic neurological deficits, or strokes of atherothrombotic origin. The patients with vertebrobasilar events at entry comprised one-third of the whole patient population. The overall total incidence of stroke or death (the end points) during the 2-year follow-up in the placebo group was lower in the vertebrobasilar group compared to the carotid group (14% versus 24%, respectively). The combination therapy of dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid caused a marked reduction in the incidence of stroke or death in patients with vertebrobasilar (51%) and carotid (30%) events. When only stroke was considered as the end point, dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid seemed to be more effective in reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks than stroke, and more effective in men than in women. \nIntravenous adenosine: continuous infusion and low dose bolus administration for determination of coronary vasodilator reserve in patients with and without coronary artery disease. To assess the use of adenosine as an alternative agent for determination of coronary vasodilator reserve, hemodynamics and coronary blood flow velocity were measured at rest and during peak hyperemic responses to continuous intravenous adenosine infusion (50, 100 and 150 micrograms/kg per min for 3 min) and intracoronary papaverine (10 mg) in 34 patients (17 without [group 1] and 17 with [group 2] significant left coronary artery disease), and in 17 patients (11 without and 6 with left coronary artery disease) after low dose (2.5 mg) intravenous bolus injection of adenosine. The maximal adenosine dose did not change mean arterial pressure (-10 +/- 14% and -6 +/- 12% for groups 1 and 2, respectively) but increased the heart rate (15 +/- 18% and 13 +/- 16, respectively). For continuous adenosine infusions, mean coronary flow velocity increased 64 +/- 104%, 122 +/- 94% and 198 +/- 59% and 15 +/- 51%, 110 +/- 95% and 109 +/- 86% in groups 1 and 2, respectively for each of the three doses. Mean coronary flow velocity increased significantly after 100 and 150 micrograms/kg of adenosine and 10 mg of intracoronary papaverine (48 +/- 25, 52 +/- 19 and 54 +/- 21 cm/s, respectively; all p less than 0.05 vs. baseline) and was significantly higher than in group 2 (37 +/- 24, 32 +/- 16, 41 +/- 23 cm/s; all p less than 0.05 vs. group 1). The coronary vasodilator reserve ratio (calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to basal mean flow velocity) for adenosine and papaverine was 2.94 +/- 1.50 and 2.94 +/- 1.00, respectively, in group 1 and was significantly and similarly reduced in group 2 (2.16 +/- 0.81 and 2.38 +/- 0.78, respectively; both p less than 0.05 vs. group 1). Low dose bolus injection of adenosine increased mean velocity equivalently to that after continuous infusion of 100 micrograms/kg, but less than after papaverine. There was a strong correlation between adenosine infusion and papaverine for both mean coronary flow velocity and coronary vasodilator reserve ratio (r2 = 0.871 and 0.325; SEE = 0.068 and 0.189, respectively; both p less than 0.0005). No patient had significant arrhythmias or prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval with adenosine, but papaverine increased the QT (QTc) interval from 445 +/- 44 to 501 +/- 43 ms (p less than 0.001 vs. both maximal adenosine and baseline) and produced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in one patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nContinuous vectorcardiography in cardiac surgery: natural course of vector changes and relationship to myocardial oxygen uptake. Continuous vectorcardiography was registered before and during the first 18 hours after cardiac surgery in 53 patients. QRS vector changes (QRS-VD) occurred during the operation, but no further changes were observed postoperatively. The ST vector (ST-VM) increased during the operation, and a further slight increase occurred postoperatively. Perioperative myocardial infarction occurred in three patients. Their ST-VM was higher than the average in patients without myocardial infarction, while QRS-VD did not differ from the average pattern. Twelve other patients were studied in pacemaker-induced moderate tachycardia. QRS-VD increased in proportion to heart-rate changes (rs median = 0.93, p less than 0.01). QRS-VD also correlated with myocardial oxygen uptake (rs median = 0.62, p less than 0.05). The ST-VM responses were not uniform. The data suggest that vectorcardiogram variables can provide information related to myocardial energy metabolism. \nValue of electrocardiographic leads MCL1, MCL6 and other selected leads in the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia. To compare the modified precordial leads MCL1 and MCL6 with the conventional precordial leads V1 and V6 and assess the diagnostic accuracy of selected leads for continuous bedside electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring, 121 wide QRS complex tachycardias were recorded from 92 patients during cardiac electrophysiologic study. As ascertained from intracardiac recordings, 86 tachycardias were ventricular and 35 were supraventricular with aberrant conduction. Early or late peaking of the predominant QRS deflection in lead MCL6 or V6 proved valuable in diagnosing wide complex tachycardia. An interval of less than or equal to 50 ms from the onset of the QRS complex to the predominant peak (or nadir) indicated supraventricular tachycardia; an interval of greater than or equal to 70 ms indicated ventricular tachycardia. The QRS complexes in leads MCL1 and MCL6 were comparable to those in leads V1 and V6 during sinus rhythm. Significant discrepancies in QRS configuration occurred between the modified and conventional precordial leads during ventricular tachycardia, especially between leads MCL1 and V1; however. these differences did not affect diagnostic accuracy. A single MCL1, V1, MCL6 or V6 lead was equally valuable in the diagnosis of wide complex tachycardia and far superior to a single lead II. A combination of leads (MCL1 + MCL6), (V1 + V6), (V1 + I + aVF) or (V1 + V6 + I + aVF) was superior to a single lead or the routinely monitored lead V1 + II combination. \nMultiple luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid transcripts. It has previously been shown that multiple messenger RNA (mRNA) species can be identified in gonadal tissues by probes specific for the LH/CG receptor. Here we show that the sizes and relative abundancies of gonadal LH/CG receptor transcripts are quite variable between such closely related species as rat and mouse. These patterns of LH/CG receptor mRNAs are yet different from that observed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that have been transfected with a cDNA encoding for the rat luteal LH/CG receptor. In spite of the diversity in the number and sizes of LH/CG receptor mRNA transcripts, however, our data also show that the size of the cell surface receptor expressed in these three cells/tissues is identical. We further show that the most abundant LH/CG receptor mRNA present in MA-10 cells, a clonal strain of cultured Leydig tumor cells, is a 1.2 kilobase transcript which encodes for a truncated version of the LH/CG receptor corresponding to the extracellular hormone-binding domain. It does not appear, however, that this transcript is translated into a functional protein. \nCytomegalovirus infection of the appendix in patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Disseminated cytomegalovirus infection occurs predominantly in immunocompromised hosts. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is frequent, but to our knowledge there is only one report of involvement of the appendix. In this study, a patient with a history of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with fever and an acute abdomen is described. At surgery, appendicitis was found. In the surgical specimen, appendicitis and cytomegalovirus infection were found. Cytomegalovirus should be considered as a possible cause of appendicitis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \nEcho Doppler duplex scanner and color in the study of portal hypertension. In the present state of the art, the Doppler duplex scanner provides much information about portal hypertension and its associated pathology, liver cirrhosis, hepatic malformations, vascular or avascular structures, hepatic transplants, and ascites. Its usefulness for experimental studies, providing new insight into the pathophysiology of this disease, has been proven. It is limited by the subjectivity of the conclusions, and by its poor feasibility in fat patients and those with excessive abdominal gas. However, the noninvasive nature of Doppler and its relative low cost make it a useful first step in the evaluation of portal hypertension. \nAnismus in patients with normal and slow transit constipation. This study examined differences in anorectal function, with particular reference to anismus, which might explain why some patients with intractable constipation have slow and others have normal whole gut transit times. Twenty-four patients were studied; 13 with slow transit (all female, median age 32 years, range 16-52 years) and 11 with normal transit (eight women, three men, median age 37 years, range 21-60 years). Videoproctography with synchronous sphincteric electromyography and anorectal manometry was performed. There were no differences between the two groups, suggesting that slow transit constipation is not secondary to any abnormality in anorectal function and may therefore be a primary disorder of colonic motility. There was no correlation between electromyographic evidence of anismus (pelvic floor contraction on defaecation) and the ability of the patient to evacute the rectum or symptoms of obstructed defaecation. Electromyography findings alone can be misleading and should be related to proctographic evidence of incomplete rectal evacuation before functional anismus can be said to be present. \nInforming schools about children's chronic illnesses: parents' opinions. Parents of 217 chronically ill children and adolescents were surveyed concerning their opinions about disclosing medical information to schools. The sample consisted of parents of more than one third of the children and adolescents meeting inclusion criteria who were seen at a university-based pediatric clinic during a 10-week period. Parents were asked (1) whether schools need information about 16 health items, (2) who in the school should know, and (3) who should provide this information. Parents' willingness to disclose information was compared with family and child demographic data. Parents strongly believed that (1) teachers need to be informed and (2) parents should be the primary informers. The consensus that schools need information did not vary with family and child demographics. However, parents of children with poor illness prognosis, greater likelihood of emergencies, and visible illnesses were more supportive of disclosure. Most parents indicated that physicians should provide information on 10 of the 16 items. Physicians were viewed as particularly appropriate informers about recognizing emergencies and medication effects. Only 21% of the parents were aware of any prior contact between the medical care giver and the school concerning their child's illness. Thus, parents want schools informed and believe physicians should be involved in providing information. \nDipyridamole echocardiography. A new diagnostic window on coronary artery disease. Dipyridamole echocardiography testing is a highly feasible, inexpensive, and safe diagnostic tool, with excellent specificity and good sensitivity--especially in patients with multivessel disease and/or resting dyssynergy--for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The test does not offer an \"all or none\" binary result but rather a complex stratification of the ischemic response along the coordinates of time and space, accurately identifying the degree of physiological impairment of coronary reserve, the severity and extent of coronary disease, the geographic location of the area at risk, and the prognostic outlook. It offers highly competitive diagnostic information versus more sophisticated, time-consuming, and costly radionuclide techniques; in comparison with other stress echocardiography techniques, it is more feasible than exercise and less invasive and better tolerated than pacing. The electrocardiogram usefully integrates the information provided by the mechanical marker of ischemia during dipyridamole testing. The finding of echocardiographically silent ST segment depression represents a clue to the identification of angiographically normal coronary arteries. On the basis of this evidence, dipyridamole testing with two-dimensional echocardiography and 12-lead electrocardiography can be considered a reasonable choice for the exercise-independent diagnosis of coronary artery disease. \nCefixime compared with amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media. Cefixime was compared with amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media in a randomized trial. Results of tympanocentesis on day 3 to 5 of therapy were used as the major outcome. Total daily doses were 8 mg/kg of cefixime and 40 mg/kg of amoxicillin. One hundred twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment; 64 cultures grew pathogens. Pathogens were eradicated from the middle ear after 3 to 5 days of therapy in 27 (79.4%) of 34 children given amoxicillin and 26 (86.7%) of 30 children given cefixime (p = 0.47). When Streptococcus pneumoniae cases were analyzed, bacteriologic cure occurred in 14 (93.3%) of 15 children given amoxicillin and 12 (75%) of 16 given cefixime (p = 0.333). When cases of Haemophilus influenzae infection were analyzed, significantly more cures occurred with cefixime (10/10, 100%) than amoxicillin (8/13, 62%) (p = 0.046). Pathogens associated with failure of amoxicillin therapy were H. influenzae (five cases, two beta-lactamase-positive), S. pneumoniae (one case), and Moraxella catarrhalis (one case, beta-lactamase-positive). The four failures with cefixime therapy were all in patients infected with S. pneumoniae. Rates of rash, diarrhea, and vomiting were the same in both groups and did not necessitate stopping therapy. We conclude the following: (1) Cefixime and amoxicillin were equivalent in overall clinical and bacteriologic efficacy for otitis media. (2) Cefixime was more efficacious than amoxicillin in treating H. influenzae otitis media and should be preferred when H. influenzae is the suspected etiologic agent. (3) Side effects of both drugs were mild and equivalent. \nFactors influencing postoperative urinary retention in patients undergoing elective inguinal herniorrhaphy. We retrospectively studied 295 men who had undergone herniorrhaphy under spinal or general endotracheal anesthesia to determine the incidence of postoperative urinary retention and to assess factors influencing it. The type and location of hernia had no effect on retention. In contrast, the use of general anesthesia, patient age above 53 years, and perioperative administration of more than 1,200 mL of fluid were significantly associated with an increase in retention. Our results suggest that urinary retention after herniorrhaphy may be prevented by limiting the amount of fluid given perioperatively and by using a spinal anesthetic, especially in older patients. \nImproved survival at 2 and 5 years in the LMCE1 unselected group of 72 children with stage IV neuroblastoma older than 1 year of age at diagnosis: is cure possible in a small subgroup? The objectives of this study were to determine (1) the role of selection before bone marrow transplantation (BMT), (2) the role of vincristine, melphalan, and total body irradiation (TBI) as consolidation of induction therapy for stage IV over 12 months at diagnosis, and (3) the role of immunomagnetic purging in metastatic neuroblastoma. Among 72 consecutive unselected patients, 10 were not grafted (four died at induction: two in complete remission [CR], two in partial remission [PR]); three had bone marrow progression before harvest; one had uncontrolled progression; and two had parental refusal). Sixty-two patients were grafted (23 in CR/very good PR [VGPR] and 39 in PR). Among the 62, 33 were consolidated with at least 90% excision of their initial tumor excised (53.2%), 15 with catecholamine secretions (24.2%), 22 with minor bone marrow involvement (35.5%), and 31 with positive bone scan (50%). Median observation time is 59 months. Progression-free survival (PFS) for the 10 excluded patients was 20% at 2 years and 0% at 4 years. PFS for the grafted population (n = 62) is 40% at 2 years, 20% at 4 years, and 13% at 7 years. No difference was observed between patients grafted in CR/VGPR or in PR. However, a group of 19 children was grafted resulting in complete normalization of metastasis (regardless of primary-site tumor status). In this group, PFS at 59 months was 38% with no relapses up to 7 years post-BMT. A group of 31 patients with no bone involvement at BMT was also identified. PFS at 5 years is 30% compared with 12% for bone-positive patients at BMT. Moreover, the 11 children presenting at diagnosis with no bone involvement (Evans stage IVS or stage C Memphis) and consolidated with BMT had PFS at 5 years of 50% with no late relapses. A subgroup of stage IV neuroblastoma patients older than 1 year of age at diagnosis may be curable with this therapeutic approach, and the use of multivariate analyses to search for prognostic factors is warranted in currently existing international registries. \nImplications of the uptake of 131I-radiolabelled meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) for the targeted radiotherapy of neuroblastoma. Selective uptake of radiolabelled meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) in neuroblastoma provides a possible approach to biologically targeted radiotherapy of this disease. A mathematical model was used to predict absorbed doses to tumours of varying size from therapeutic 131I-mIBG, based on measurements of 125I-mIBG uptake in surgically excised tumours from six patients. Two size categories of tumour target were considered: bulk tumour and microscopic disease. The predicted absorbed doses were compared with doses calculated to achieve a 50% probability of tumour cure. The analysis shows that the probability of tumour cure depends strongly on mIBG uptake, effective half-life of mIBG in tumour and tumour diameter. Small microtumours may be relatively resistant to mIBG treatment owing to the limited absorption of 131I beta-energy. The product of patient mass and percentage uptake per unit mass of tumour may be a useful indicator of therapeutic outcome when targeted radiotherapy is used for the treatment of paediatric tumours. \nTranscranial magnetic stimulation in patients with epilepsy. We studied the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied in trains of 8- to 25-Hz stimuli on electroencephalographic epileptiform activity on eight patients being evaluated for epilepsy surgery. We performed the stimulation with a round water-cooled stimulation coil held flat on the scalp and centered over different positions of the International 10-20 System. We were unable to trigger seizures or induce epileptiform discharges arising from the epileptic focus in any of the eight patients with any of the stimulation protocols. However, we induced a partial motor seizure from the contralateral hemisphere to the exclusive temporal focus in the only patient stimulated with 100% maximal intensity. Precautions have to be taken when applying rapid TMS to patients because of the risk of seizure induction. Our results do not support the view that TMS specifically activates the epileptic foci. \nVenous gangrene (phlegmasia caerulea dolens) complicating heart failure from severe mitral stenosis--a case history. Gangrene of the left upper limb was found to complicate severe mitral stenosis presenting with heart failure in a sixty-eight-year-old woman with a documented left atrial thrombus. Arterial obstruction as the cause of gangrene was excluded by Doppler-assisted assessment of the peripheral pulses. Venous gangrene can complicate severe mitral stenosis and must be distinguished from arterial embolization, in which urgent surgical treatment is imperative. \nHeterotopic heart transplantation and native heart ventricular arrhythmias. Heterotopic heart transplantation has been said to be contraindicated in patients with serious native heart arrhythmias that produce hemodynamic instability. Placement of heterotopic allografts, however, can theoretically act as a biological biventricular assist device to provide hemodynamic support during these unstable rhythms. Further, this operation might beneficially alter the hemodynamic milieu of heart failure such that the arrhythmias are ameliorated. Described is our experience with 4 patients with heart failure receiving heterotopic cardiac allografts, documenting changes in native heart arrhythmia that occurred. These cases demonstrate that heterotopic grafts can adequately sustain hemodynamics during malignant native heart dysrhythmia. We believe native heart ventricular arrhythmias are not a contraindication to heterotopic heart transplantation. \nTransperineurial vessel constriction in an edematous neuropathy. The hypothesis that the accumulation of endoneurial edema can exert forces sufficient to occlude transperineurial vessels was tested using light microscopy and computer-assisted morphometry in rat sciatic nerve. Experimental nerves were exposed to a concentration of 10% procaine HCl, which from previous studies has been demonstrated to routinely produce an edematous neuropathy. For each vessel, a \"constriction ratio\" was defined by dividing its minimum intraperineurial lumen area by the average for minimum endoneurial and epineurial lumen cross-sectional areas. Constriction ratios were 0.91 +/- 0.26 (mean +/- SD) for control vessels and 0.28 +/- 0.25 for vessels in the procaine group (p less than 0.005). In addition, a strong negative correlation was observed between the morphologic demonstration of nerve edema and the transperineurial vessel constriction ratio (r = -0.85; p less than 0.002). It is concluded that in neuropathies characterized by widespread edema and increased endoneurial fluid pressures, the concomitant constriction of transperineurial vessels could diminish nerve blood flow and facilitate nerve injury. \nThe role of radical surgery in the management of radiation recurrent and large volume prostate cancer. Twenty-two patients seen between 1975 and 1988 were analyzed who had surgical attempts to cure locally advanced prostate cancer by exenterative procedures or salvage surgery for radiation recurrent disease. Twelve patients (Group I) underwent either a salvage cystoprostatectomy or perineal prostatectomy for radiorecurrent disease, including three patients with a Kock continent urinary diversion done in combination with the salvage operation. Five of the 12 (41.7%) recurrent disease confined to the surgical specimen and 11 of 12 (91.7%) are alive at a mean follow-up of 49 months, including four patients (25%) with a completely negative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value (less than 0.2 ng/dl). All perineal prostatectomy patients are continent, and two of the three Kock pouch patients are continent. Ten of the 22 patients (Group II) had a cystoprostatectomy or exenteration for locally advanced disease that the surgeon did not think was amenable to standard radical prostatectomy. Only one of these ten patients had negative surgical margins, capsule, and seminal vesicles. Nine are alive (although only one patient has no evidence of disease) at a mean follow-up of 59 months. Morbidity was substantial with a 50% major complication rate including four patients requiring reoperation because of bleeding, abscess, bowel obstruction, or colostomy closure. Salvage procedures for radiorecurrent disease can be done safely, even with the inclusion of a continent diversion, and may be curative or provide survival benefit to carefully selected patients. Cystoprostatectomy or exenteration for locally advanced disease does not appear to be a curative endeavor for most patients and may be accompanied by significant morbidity. \nFull-field electroretinograms in patients with the carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome. We examined five patients who had carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome with full-field electroretinograms. Only two of the patients showed fundus changes typical for retinitis pigmentosa, whereas abnormal electroretinograms were seen in all patients. There was no recordable rod response; however, a delay in the cone b-wave implicit time was noted. All patients had nyctalopia. These observations suggest that patients with the carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome have a progressive tapetoretinal degenerative disorder of the retinitis pigmentosa type with defined alterations in the electroretinogram. \nTreatment of adenomyosis with long-term GnRH analogues: a case report. Presented here is the first reported case of biopsy-proved adenomyosis treated medically with long-term GnRH analogue. Uterine volume, as calculated by serial ultrasound measurements, was reduced by 65% after 4 months and remained small several months after discontinuation of therapy. Size reduction was accompanied by amenorrhea and relief of severe dysmenorrhea. Though not proposed as a substitute for surgery, GnRH analogue may be useful as a surgical adjuvant or for temporary reduction of symptoms. \nThe representation of the visual field in human striate cortex. A revision of the classic Holmes map. We have tested the accuracy of Gordon Holmes' retinotopic map of human striate cortex by correlating magnetic resonance scans with homonymous field defects in patients with clearly defined occipital lobe lesions. Our findings indicate that Holmes underestimated the cortical magnification of central vision. In a revised map of the human striate cortex, we expand the area subserving central vision and reduce the area devoted to peripheral vision. These changes bring the map of human striate cortex into agreement with data reported for closely related nonhuman primate species. \nEquivalent total doses for different fractionation schemes, based on the linear quadratic model. A majority of patients receiving radical radiation therapy are treated with 1.8-2.0-Gy fractions, a dose that has evolved from clinical experience. However, other fractionation schemes can be advantageous. When fractionation is altered, the total dose prescribed should lead to equivalent or higher tumor control with the same or less tissue toxicity. To facilitate the use of different fractionation schemes, the authors compiled tables for equivalent biologic doses for late toxicity in normal tissues and tumoricidal doses for epithelial tumors, for various fraction sizes. The linear quadratic model according to Fowler was used. It is shown how these tables should be modified for proliferation of tumors during the course of radiation therapy. The tables make the use of different fractionation schemes easy. They also allow adjustment of total dose if fractionation needs to be changed during the course of treatment. \nMyocardial echinococcosis with perforation into the pericardium. Though rare, cardiac echinococcosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiac tumors, particularly in patients originating from endemic areas or with manifestation of hydatid disease in other organs. Diagnosis and localisation of the cysts is best accomplished with non-invasive methods such as 2-D transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography and NMR. Excision of the cardiac cyst from the interventricular septum in a 21 year old patient with polyvisceral echinococcosis was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass. Adjunctive medical therapy with mebendazol is being continued for 24 months postoperatively. Twelve months after surgery the patient is asymptomatic without echocardiographic signs of recurrence. \nGastro-oesophageal reflux and respiratory function in infants with respiratory symptoms. This study aimed to define the incidence and severity of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), as measured using 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring, in 38 infants with recurrent respiratory symptoms and to relate these findings to measures of respiratory function. Twenty one infants had a pH under 4 for more than 5% of the time (one definition of abnormal GOR) and nine had GOR exceeding age related normal values. Maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity was reduced in 37 infants, airways resistance was raised in 19 infants, and thoracic gas volume was abnormal in 11 infants. There was no association between indices of GOR and measures of lung function whether assessed by correlation or by chi 2 analysis for normal versus abnormal values. However, individual infants appeared to have respiratory symptoms produced by GOR. This suggests that host responsiveness to GOR may be of greater relevance than the amount of GOR. \nResults of the pelvic-pouch procedure in patients with Crohn's disease. The pelvic-pouch procedure has become a standard operation for selected patients with ulcerative colitis, but is contraindicated in patients with Crohn's disease at our institution. However, the distinction between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis can sometimes be difficult, if not impossible. Between January 1982, and March 1989, 272 patients with ulcerative colitis underwent pelvic-pouch procedures at our institution. Nine (3.5 percent) of these patients eventually were found to have Crohn's disease. The records of these patients were examined to assess their clinical outcome and complication rate. There were five females and four males with a mean age of 28.8 years. In five patients (Group I) the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was made postoperatively on histologic examination of the rectum. The ileostomy was closed in all patients. Two developed complications necessitating excision of the pouch. Three patients are well. In the other four cases (Group II) the mean time to diagnosis was 2.5 years after the pouch procedure. Three patients developed pouch-vaginal fistula, and one multiple anal fissures and stenosis. Two required excision of the pouch whereas two have a functioning pouch but with a persistent pouch-vaginal fistula (n = 1) or anal fissures (n = 1). Overall, four patients have had their pouches removed, and five patients have functioning pouches: three with no complications and two with persistent perianal disease. Thus, we would conclude that the pelvic-pouch procedure should not knowingly be performed in patients with Crohn's disease because of the high associated complication rate. \nIdentification of colon cancer-predisposed individuals: a cytogenetic analysis. Peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 23 individuals with polyps and 10 age-matched controls were cytogenetically studied. Of 23 individuals with polyps, 13 were males and 10 females. The age distribution of these patients was between 22 and 84 yr, with a medium age of 49.6 yr. Chromosome 5 was involved in structural rearrangements in 10 of the 18 patients with adenomatous polyps (55.5%). All those who showed involvement of chromosome 5 alterations had either adenomatous polyps or Gardner's syndrome, and two had colon adenocarcinoma. Of the remainder who did not show involvement of chromosome 5, eight had adenomatous polyps and five had hyerplastic polyps (non-neoplastic). Of the 10 control samples, only one showed alteration of chromosome 5. Of the 10 adenomatous polyp subjects that showed chromosome 5 defects, two had translocations of chromosome 5 and the short arm of 17. Chromosome 5 was broken 13 times (5 times in the q arm and 8 times in the p arm). Based on our present cytogenetic data, we tentatively conclude that lymphocyte metaphases may be used to identify colon cancer-predisposed individuals. \nAIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with HIV infection. We investigated the epidemiology and aetiology of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma by analysing data from cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA, up to June 30, 1989. During this period 97,258 AIDS cases were reported, of whom 2824 (2.9%) had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The condition was about 60 times more common in AIDS patients than in the general US population. 1686 cases were immunoblastic lymphoma, 548 primary lymphoma of the brain, and 590 Burkitt's lymphoma, a condition which is not normally associated with immunosuppression. The proportion of AIDS patients with immunoblastic lymphoma increased from 0% in those under 1 year old to 3.5% in those aged 50 or more. Primary lymphoma of the brain was constant at 0.6% for all ages. The frequency of Burkitt's lymphoma increased from zero in infants to a peak at 10-19 years of age (1.8%). Each type of lymphoma was twice as common in whites as in blacks and in men as in women. Lymphoma was most common in patients with haemophilia or clotting disorders and least common in those born in the Caribbean or Africa who had acquired HIV by heterosexual contact. Epidemiological data suggested that whilst infectious agents (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) may be associated with development of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in AIDS patients there was probably no single cause for all the types of lymphoma. Perhaps the most puzzling question is why Burkitt's lymphoma is commonly associated with HIV infection but not with other types of immunosuppression. \nInhaled nitric oxide. A selective pulmonary vasodilator reversing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. BACKGROUND. We examined the effects of inhalation of 5-80 ppm nitric oxide (NO) gas on the normal and acutely constricted pulmonary circulation in awake lambs. METHODS AND RESULTS. Spontaneous breathing of nitric oxide (an endothelium-derived relaxing factor) at 40 ppm or more reversed acute pulmonary vasoconstriction within 3 minutes either because of infusion of the stable thromboxane endoperoxide analogue U46619 or because of pulmonary hypertension due to breathing a hypoxic gas mixture. Systemic vasodilation did not occur. Pulmonary vasodilation by NO inhalation was produced during infusion of U46619 for periods of 1 hour without observing evidence of short-term tolerance. Pulmonary hypertension resumed within 3-6 minutes of ceasing NO inhalation. In the normal lamb, the pulmonary vascular resistance, systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output, left atrial and central venous pressures were unaltered by NO inhalation. CONCLUSION. Breathing 80 ppm NO for 3 hours did not increase either methemoglobin or extravascular lung water levels or modify lung histology compared with those in control lambs. \nDiagnosis and treatment of headache in the elderly. The diagnosis and management of some causes of headache in the elderly are reviewed. Etiologic theories have been presented for each condition. Treatment modalities include pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and surgical therapies. The treatment course set forth in this article can help the clinician provide proper relief for the patient in pain. \nFailure of MR imaging to detect reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities is a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. It is characterized by pain, hyperthermia, and cutaneous changes and has been linked to an abnormality of regional blood flow. The disease is associated with previous injury or trauma including surgery, but also has been found in association with myocardial infarctions and tumors. The final diagnosis can be made only on the basis of the clinical course, which is characterized either by regression without sequel or the appearance of aponeurotic and tendinous retractions including bony sclerosis in the affected region occurring over many months to years. The literature and our own results show that MR imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosing transient osteoporosis of the hip, which is generally thought to be a form of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Therefore we investigated the usefulness of MR imaging for diagnosing sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities. Twenty-five patients underwent T1- and T2-weighted MR imaging of the affected body region. They were selected on the basis of the initial clinical findings and positive findings on scintigraphy, which is known to be a sensitive, but not very specific, imaging method for sympathetic dystrophy. The final diagnosis was established on the basis of the clinical course in 17 of the 25 patients. In 10 of these, findings on MR images were completely normal, in six the MR images showed only nonspecific soft-tissue changes or bone marrow sclerosis, and in one patient they showed changes in bone marrow signal. Of the remaining eight patients without a final diagnosis of sympathetic dystrophy, MR showed soft-tissue or bone marrow alterations in six. MR imaging appears to be of little value in establishing the diagnosis of sympathetic dystrophy, but it may improve diagnostic specificity when used in conjunction with scintigraphy. \nEndoscopic sinus surgery: outcome in 155 cases. For this retrospective study of endoscopic sinus surgery, charts of 22 patients from a medical center and 133 patients from a private practice (N = 155) were reviewed. Preoperative complaints, clinical findings, computed tomographic evidence of extent of sinus disease, surgical outcome, possible predictors of success, and complications were considered. Indications for endoscopic surgery were persistence of symptoms despite aggressive medical therapy and radiologic evidence of a significant sinus abnormality. Median followup was 12 months. Hemorrhage occurred postoperatively in two patients (1.5%); 17 patients required additional endoscopic surgery. Overall, 140 (91%) patients believed that the surgery was beneficial. Patients with facial pain preoperatively showed the greatest improvement. All patients having simultaneous septoplasty (N = 64) had successful outcome. The total number of opacified sinuses was not a predictor of outcome, but opacificaiton of the sphenoid sinus correlated with a poorer outcome. The patients seen at the medical center had poorer results, but had a larger number of opacified sinuses, were more likely to have had previous sinus surgery, and were more likely to have underlying medical conditions contributing to their sinus disease. \nExperience with 225 hepatic resections for hepatocellular carcinoma over a 4-year period. During the past 4 1/2 years, we have performed hepatic resection on 225 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These patients included 171 men and 54 women, whose ages ranged from 29 to 84 years with an average of 60 years. Underlying cirrhosis of the liver was found in 67% of the patients and chronic hepatitis in 27%. Patients undergoing hepatic resection were classified into five groups according to curability as follows: Group A, resection of the tumor-bearing segment and one additional segment; Group B, complete resection of the tumor with more than 1.0 cm free surgical margin; Group C, complete resection of the tumor with less than 1.0 cm free surgical margin; Group D, incomplete resection of the tumor; Group E, surgical approach for advanced HCC with tumor thrombi in the main trunk or the first branch of the portal vein and/or the inferior vena cava, with multiple daughter nodules in both lobes and with tumor recurrence. The number of patients in Groups A, B, C, D, and E was 12 (5%), 83 (37%), 58 (26%), 14 (6%) and 58, (26%), respectively. There were 4 deaths (2.4%) among the 167 patients in Groups A to D within 30 days after operation and 12 deaths (20.7%) in Group E. The 3-year survival rate of Groups A, B, C, D, and E was 100%, 74%, 21%, 0%, and 35%, respectively. \nAltered antigen receptor signaling in anergic T cells from self-tolerant T-cell receptor beta-chain transgenic mice. T-cell tolerance to the minor lymphocyte-stimulating antigen Mls-1a in a T-cell receptor (TcR) V beta 8.1 transgenic line of mice is maintained by both clonal deletion and clonal anergy. Approximately 20-50% of peripheral CD4+ (but not CD8+) T cells isolated from these mice are anergic and fail to proliferate following TcR ligation. We have examined key events in T-cell signaling in peripheral T cells isolated from these mice. In this report, we show that the anergic CD4+ T cells did not mobilize calcium or express receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2) following TcR ligation. However, the cells retained viability and functional potential because stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin bypassed the block in receptor-mediated signaling and induced IL-2 receptor expression and proliferation of the anergic cells. \nReducing postischemic paraplegia using conjugated superoxide dismutase. Paraplegia after thoracic aortic aneurysm repair has an incidence of 2.2% to 24%. Oxygen-derived free radicals after reperfusion of an ischemic spinal cord may be partly responsible for neuronal destruction. We studied the effects of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), a free radical scavenger, as a way of increasing spinal cord tolerance to ischemia. Thirty rabbits underwent 40 minutes of aortic occlusion (a known model of paraplegia). Ten of these animals received 25,000 U/kg of PEG-SOD 24 hours before aortic occlusion and two additional doses of 10,000 U/kg, one before and one subsequent to spinal ischemia. Ten animals received superoxide dismutase in the same dosages as those receiving PEG-SOD. Ten control animals received placebo. All animals were studied for 96 hours, at which time a final neurological examination was performed and the results were recorded. Of the 10 animals treated with PEG-SOD, 2 were completely paralyzed whereas 8 had less (7) or no (1) neurological impairment. Eight of the 10 control animals and 9 of the 10 animals receiving superoxide dismutase were completely paralyzed. None of the control animals or animals receiving superoxide dismutase had a normal neurological examination (p less than or equal to 0.05). Treatment with PEG-SOD before and during occlusion increased the rabbit spinal cord tolerance to a 40-minute ischemic insult. Scavenging free radicals may lessen experimental spinal cord injury. \nInfusional carboplatin. Phase I studies of 5-day and 14-day infusions. Twenty-two courses of carboplatin (Paraplatin; Bristol-Meyers, Evansville, IN) (CBDCA) were administered to 15 patients with advanced cancer on a continuous 24-hour per day infusion schedule for either 5 days or 14 days. The objective of the trial was to establish the optimal dose rate and cumulative dose for this treatment schedule. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia observed. The optimal dose rate for the 5-day infusion was 75 mg/m2/d or a total cumulative dose of 375 mg/m2/d. The optimal dose rate for the 14-day infusion was 25 mg/m2/d or a total cumulative dose of 350 mg/m2/d. The times to nadir levels of leukocyte and platelet counts were 34 days and 25 days, respectively, with a median time to recovery of 14 days and 7 days, respectively, in patients with Grade 3 or greater marrow suppression. The pattern of hematologic toxicity with infusional CBDCA is comparable to that seen with bolus schedules. There is, therefore, no clinical advantage of the infusional schedule for CBDCA in terms of toxicity and the dose delivered per cycle, and the dose intensity is slightly less than with a bolus schedule. If there is a therapeutic advantage for the infusional schedule, a prospective comparative trial against the standard bolus schedule will be required to establish it. Bolus and infusional schedules for CBDCA are associated with a delayed pattern of thrombocytopenia and prolonged leukopenia, necessitating 5 or more weeks between treatment cycles. \nSelective gene expression in failing human heart. Quantification of steady-state levels of messenger RNA in endomyocardial biopsies using the polymerase chain reaction. BACKGROUND. Evaluation of gene expression in failing human heart has been limited by the availability of cardiac tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess gene expression in small quantities of failing and nonfailing human heart. PCR is a powerful new molecular biological tool that allows a small quantity of DNA to be amplified as much as 1 million-fold. Total RNA was extracted from 3-5 mg samples of human heart and reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA). With selected oligonucleotide primers, we used PCR to amplify cDNAs encoding atrial natriuretic peptide, beta-myosin heavy chain, phospholamban, and cytoskeletal beta-actin. To quantify the relative levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) in human heart, a known amount of a control RNA was present in the reverse transcription and PCR reactions. The amount of mRNA in the sample could therefore be assessed in relation to the amount of control product. The control RNA was transcribed from a synthetic DNA template containing primers complementary to those used to amplify the cDNAs of interest. Atrial natriuretic factor mRNA could not be detected in nonfailing human heart but was abundant in ventricular myocardium from failing human heart. In contrast, steady-state levels of phospholamban mRNA decreased, whereas levels of beta-myosin heavy-chain mRNA were unchanged with heart failure. CONCLUSIONS. Alterations in gene expression in the failing human heart appear to be selective. In addition, the present study suggests that PCR provides a rapid and economical way to quantify the expression of multiple genes of interest in endomyocardial biopsy specimens and may therefore be used to advance our understanding of heart muscle disease. \nIatrogenic pneumomediastinum after endodontic therapy. An unusual case of pneumomediastinum caused by subcutaneous emphysema occurring after the use of hydrogen peroxide solution during root canal treatment is described in a 30-year-old man. A thorough search of the available literature failed to reveal similar cases. A review of the literature, including pathogenesis, clinical and radiographic features, and management of this condition, is presented. \nSurgical versus percutaneous drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses. The records of 83 patients with intra-abdominal abscesses treated between 1986 and 1990 were reviewed to determine if there were significant differences in the outcome of patients treated by surgical drainage (n = 41) or percutaneous drainage (n = 42). The two groups were matched for age, abscess location, and etiology. Parametric statistical evaluations included the Student's t test as well as analysis of variance; nonparametric statistics used were chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sums. No significant difference was found in mortality (surgical 14% versus percutaneous 12%) or morbidity (surgical 26% versus percutaneous 29%). The duration of hospital stay was similar. Although there was no significant difference between the two groups in severity of illness as measured by APACHE II scores, these scores were significant in determining prognosis. APACHE II scores were significantly higher in non-survivors of both groups (23 versus 13) and also higher in those developing complications. A subgroup of patients with diverticular abscess was identified in whom percutaneous drainage enabled later resection with primary anastomosis without complication. This study indicates that percutaneous drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess is as efficacious as surgical drainage and that APACHE II scores are prognostic of both potential mortality and morbidity. \nChildhood haemangiomas of the head and neck. Haemangiomas of the head and neck in children may be of several histological types, the clinical course depending on the group to which the haemangioma belongs. Treatment may be required if the haemangioma interferes with the airway, as in the subglottic group, or if the lesion becomes ulcerated with subsequent haemorrhage, as in capillary cavernous haemangiomas. Most haemangiomas require no immediate treatment as they involute spontaneously, though parental reassurance will be of paramount importance. Those lesions which persist may be amenable to treatment at a later date, the laser probably offering the best long-term results in terms of cosmesis as in the case of port-wine stains. Superselective embolization is becoming the treatment of choice for arterial haemangiomas. This paper is designed to clarify the histological and clinical features of these tumours and their management in view of considerable confusion in the literature encountered in our study. \nResolution of microsporidial epithelial keratopathy in a patient with AIDS. A patient with a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) titer and cryptococcal meningitis suffered bilateral epithelial keratopathy caused by Encephalitozoon, which did not respond to sulfas, erythromycin, bacitracin, tobramycin, neomycin, polymyxin B, or fluconazole. Eventual administration of itraconazole for the meningitis apparently produced resolution of the long-lasting (2-month) ocular infection. This new oral triazole antifungal may be valuable against the increasingly prevalent microsporidial infections in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Debulking of the infection by corneal scraping may have contributed to the authors' success. \nEpidemiology of chronic venous ulcers. A metropolitan population of 238,000 in Perth, Western Australia, was screened for chronic ulceration of the leg. Patients with a chronic leg ulcer and a venous abnormality comprised 57 per cent of all patients with a chronic leg ulcer, giving a prevalence of 0.62 per 1000 population. There was an increasing prevalence with age; 90 per cent of patients were 60 years and older. This group comprised 16.7 per cent of the population, and had a prevalence of 3.3 per 1000. Although chronic venous ulcers were more common in women there was no difference in age related prevalence. In 36 per cent of patients with a venous abnormality, there was at least one other aetiological factor contributing to chronic ulceration of the leg; 96 per cent had either a history of deep venous thrombosis or a condition known to predispose to deep venous thrombosis. \nBiliary pancreatitis. Operative outcome with a selective approach. To evaluate the efficacy of a selective approach to biliary pancreatitis, we reviewed the outcomes in 276 consecutive patients undergoing operations for this diagnosis during a 7-year period. Initial conservative therapy resulted in elective operations in 63% and urgent operations in 37%. Only 10 patients (3.6%) required primary pancreatic operations, 50% of them as emergencies. The proportion of common duct surgical explorations fell from 70% of those operated immediately after hospital admission to 20% by the third hospital day. Overall mortality was 1.8% but was increased to 30% in patients having an initial pancreatic operation. We conclude that a selective approach to biliary pancreatitis allows the operation to be performed electively in most patients and is associated with a low mortality and an acceptable length of stay. Most common duct stones pass spontaneously permitting cholecystectomy alone. \nDiagnosing and managing oral lichen planus. Lichen planus is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disease characterized by unpredictable exacerbations and remissions. It affects the skin and/or mucous membrane in nearly 2 percent of the adult population. The symptoms are transient, but clinical evidence of oral disease is more persistent. \nInduction of transformational changes in normal endothelial cells by cultured human astrocytoma cells. Endothelial cell proliferation is a significant biological feature of malignant astrocytomas. The ability of the cells of these tumors to elaborate mitogenic angiogenesis factors has been well documented. However, less is known about the transformational",
