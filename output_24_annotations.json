        "text": "sion trials. Recent trials of antihypertensive therapy, including the Veterans Administration trials, the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, the Australian Mild Hypertension Trial, and the British Medical Research Council Trial, are reviewed with a particular emphasis on the criteria leading to the exclusion of potentially eligible participants. The observation of all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in the group ultimately selected to participate in the trial is suggested as an index to the general applicability of trial results. Because end-point rates are fundamental for determining sample size, substantial reduction in these end-point rates by patient exclusion should be taken into account by the trial design. Some recent trials may have generated end-point-event rates so low that the power of the trial to detect reasonable treatment effects was substantially reduced. Future trials should attempt to take this important factor into account at the design stage. \nSeminal vesicle cysts: association with adult polycystic kidney disease. Adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) is associated with cyst formation in the kidney, liver, pancreas, esophagus, ovary, uterus, and brain. Four patients with APKD (aged 45-65 years) with computed tomographic evidence of seminal vesicle cysts are described. All seminal vesicles contained cystic masses with attenuation values of 0-30 HU. Seminal vesicle thickness was 3-4 cm (normal, 1.5 cm). High-attenuation walls separated the cysts, which were 3-35 mm in diameter. All patients had typical renal stigmata of APKD. None had cysts elsewhere, except one patient with hepatic cysts. Postmortem examination in one patient confirmed the seminal vesicle cysts as well as APKD. It is likely that a basement membrane defect allows cyst formation in multiple organs, presumably including the seminal vesicles. Because of the association of seminal vesicle cysts with ipsilateral urogenital anomalies, and because only 60% of patients with APKD have a relevant familial history, the kidneys of patients with cross-sectional imaging evidence of seminal vesicle cysts should also be studied. \nPenetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer with dissecting hematoma: control of bleeding with percutaneous embolization. A case is presented in which left subpleural hematoma and hemothorax resulted from a penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer with an aortic pseudoaneurysm and intramedial hematoma. Percutaneous transfemoral embolization of the ulcer with use of coils and thrombin resulted in stabilization of the patient's hemodynamic status. The patient died 6 days later of pneumonia. In certain clinical situations, treatment of bleeding from penetrating aortic ulcers with percutaneous embolization may stabilize the patient's condition, allowing elective surgical intervention. \nEffect of hypoxic exercise on atrial natriuretic factor and aldosterone regulation. To evaluate the possible physiologic role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in the observed dissociation of aldosterone secretion from the renin-angiotensin system during hypoxic exercise, 12 untrained men, ages 18 to 24, were studied on two separate days for 30 min during hypoxic (16% O2) and normoxic (room air) exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Workloads were adjusted to produce individual heart rates that remained within 70 to 75% of their previously measured maximum. Hemoglobin saturation decreased during hypoxia from 98 +/- 0.1% to 90 +/- 0.4% (P less than .01). Plasma aldosterone levels increased significantly (P less than .01) under both breathing conditions, yet were on average 36% lower during hypoxia than during normoxia (P less than .001). Plasma ANF levels increased during exercise under both conditions (P less than .01), yet levels were 45% greater during hypoxia than during normoxia (P less than .001). Plasma renin activity, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, potassium, and systolic blood pressure increased during exercise on both study days (P less than .01, compared to basal level), and showed no difference between normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Plasma pH was slightly higher during hypoxic exercise (P less than .05, compared to normoxia). We conclude that acute hypoxemia is a potent enhancing stimulus for ANF release during dynamic exercise and that ANF is probably a contributing factor in the dissociation of aldosterone secretion from the renin-angiotensin system under these conditions. \nUse of technetium-HMPAO to demonstrate changes in cerebral blood flow reserve following carotid endarterectomy. Cerebral perfusion through stenosed internal carotid arteries is usually maintained by autoregulation. However, flow reserve may be reduced, suggesting hemodynamically significant stenosis, and such reduction should be improved by carotid endarterectomy. This concept was studied in 20 subjects with unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (major stenosis greater than or equal to 70%, minor stenosis less than or equal to 50%). Thirteen had experienced recent transient ischemic attacks and seven had no definite focal symptoms. Subjects underwent Tc-HMPAO cerebral SPECT during acetazolamide dysautoregulation before and after internal carotid endarterectomy. Nine (45%) had perfusion defects that improved after surgery, suggesting surgery had improved cerebral flow reserve. Seven had defects that did not improve after surgery. Four had worsened or new defects after surgery, suggesting perioperative infarcts. The relatively large proportion of patients with improved cerebral blood flow reserve after surgery suggests that this technique may have a significant role to play in assessing which patients might benefit from carotid endarterectomy. \nA comparison of treatment outcomes for black patients and white patients with metastatic breast cancer. The Piedmont Oncology Association experience. Prior studies have shown that black patients with breast cancer have poorer survival times compared with white patients even when adjusted for stage. Seventy-four black patients treated on six Piedmont Oncology Association (POA) protocols were compared with 74 randomly selected white patients treated with the same protocols to determine if race had any independent effect on response, time to progression, or survival time. Patients were evenly matched for pretreatment characteristics with the exception that white patients had a significantly higher percentage of bone metastases and significantly less skin involvement. Response rates and median time to progression were similar for black patients and white patients at 31% and 25%, and 9.3 and 9.1 months, respectively. Black patients had poorer survival times even when adjusting for covariables; median survival time was 14.3 months for black patients and 20.3 months for white patients (P less than 0.05). The reason for this survival difference in Stage IV patients is unclear, but is unlikely to be related to treatment. Additional research in this area will be necessary to resolve this issue. \nExercise-induced muscle soreness after concentric and eccentric isokinetic contractions. The purpose of this two-part study was to determine whether the amount of exercise-induced muscle soreness differs between subjects who perform concentric and eccentric isokinetic contractions of their quadriceps femoris muscles. In experiment 1, subjects were randomly assigned to either an eccentric or a concentric exercise group and both groups exercised at the same power level. In experiment 2, subjects were randomly assigned to either an eccentric or a concentric exercise group and both groups exercised with maximal effort. Muscle soreness ratings, obtained by using a visual analogue scale, were taken immediately before exercise and at 24 and 48 hours postexercise. Changes in muscle soreness ratings between exercise groups from preexercise to postexercise periods were compared in both experiments, using a one-way between-subjects analysis of variance. There was no difference in the change in muscle soreness from preexercise to post-exercise periods between groups exercising at equal power levels. Subjects who exercised using eccentric contractions with maximal effort demonstrated greater increases in muscle soreness than those who performed concentric contractions. The results suggest that exercise intensity, rather than contraction type, may be the dependent factor in producing exercise-induced muscle soreness. \nDifferentiation between hemangiomas and metastases of the liver with ultrafast MR imaging: preliminary results with T2 calculations. We studied the efficacy of T2 measurements at high field strength in distinguishing between liver hemangiomas and hepatic metastases when an ultrafast (single-excitation) MR imaging technique is used. Fourteen patients with known liver tumors were imaged in a 2.0-T prototype ultrafast MR scanner with a spin-echo (infinite TR and TE of 30-340 msec) pulse sequence. Each image was obtained with a total data acquisition time of 20 msec. T2 calculations for hepatic metastases (n = 6) showed a mean of 79.3 +/- 13.5 msec, whereas hemangiomas (n = 8) showed a T2 of 139.8 +/- 18.8 msec (p less than .0001). T2 values of lesions had a smaller relative standard deviation than previously reported, and the range of T2 values of hemangiomas (119-181 msec) and metastases (68-103 msec) did not overlap. Our preliminary results suggest that T2 calculations with ultrafast MR imaging may be useful for differentiating hemangiomas from metastases. We hypothesize that T2 values obtained from ultrafast MR images are more reliable than those obtained from conventional MR images, primarily because of the elimination of T1 information and effects of motion on image signal intensity. \nThrombolysis in unstable angina: results of clinical studies. Ample evidence exists to support the major role of intracoronary thrombosis superimposed on a disrupted plaque in unstable angina. Consequently, thrombolytic treatment, already established to be highly beneficial in patients with acute myocardial infarction, might also be indicated in patients with unstable angina. The clinical response to thrombolytic treatment has been evaluated in several small-sized studies with inconsistent and somewhat deceiving results. Thus, the role of thrombolysis in the treatment of unstable angina is still controversial. Two ongoing large-scale, randomized, controlled trials, the Third Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI III) in the United States testing recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator and UNASEM in Europe testing anisoylated plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex will, it is hoped, solve the debate. At present, early thrombolysis might be considered for the treatment of the subset of patients with severe rest angina associated with transient ST-T ischemic changes. \nDoes oximetry contribute to the detection of apneic events? Mathematical processing of the SaO2 signal. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of continuous nocturnal oximetry to detect sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) and to recognize nonapneic oxyhemoglobin desaturations. Oxygen saturation oscillations, related to successive apneas in SAS or to apneic episodes in COPD or restrictive patients, were quantified using a new index: delta = 1/n sigma 1 n magnitude of delta(SaO2)/delta(t)(12-s intervals) Twenty-six patients (15 SAS, 8 COPD, and 3 restrictive patients) were included in a prospective study comparing nocturnal oximetry and polysomnography over 34 nights. In apneic patients, we found a strong correlation (r2 = 0.73, p less than 0.01) between time spent in apnea and the delta index. In COPD, the number of apneas was also correlated to the delta index (r2 = 0.92, p less than 0.01). A lower threshold for delta of 1.5 is accurate enough to detect apneas if initial SaO2 is greater than 93 percent. If initial SaO2 is greater than 93 percent, the delta threshold should be 0.8 (sensitivity 95 percent). Such a method could contribute to the accurate selection of patients for polysomnography. \nEffect of antibiotics on food intake and absorption of nutrients for children with diarrhea due to Shigella. The effect of antibiotic therapy on intake of food and absorption of nutrients for 19 male children aged 1-5 years with suspected shigella infection was studied. The children were admitted to the hospital with acute diarrhea, high fever, abdominal pain, and greater than or equal to 25 red blood cells and white blood cells per high-power field in the stool. Microbiologic diagnosis was made within 48 hours of admission. On the basis of clinical and microbiologic criteria, children were classified as having mild or severe infection. Ten children with mild infection did not receive antibiotics, whereas nine children with severe infection were treated with ampicillin. After the children were rehydrated, a 72-hour balance study was carried out during the acute stage of infection with Shigella and was repeated 2 weeks after recovery. The levels of consumption of food and absorption of nutrients were estimated. During the acute stage of infection, such levels were higher for the children treated with antibiotics than for the untreated group. During the recovery phase, the levels of intake of food and absorption of nutrients were equal for both groups. Thus, children who are treated with appropriate antibiotics not only may recover from infection with Shigella more rapidly, but they also may be able to absorb nutrients more efficiently. \nFlexible bronchoscopy via the laryngeal mask: a new technique. Malignant tracheal tumours often cause airway obstruction and this may be aggravated by vocal cord paralysis due to invasion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Conventional endoscopic techniques performed under general anaesthesia do not give a simultaneous view of vocal cord function and the distal airways. The technique of bronchoscopy via the laryngeal mask allowed full assessment of the cause of stridor in a patient with a malignant tracheal tumour that was causing airways obstruction and vocal cord paralysis. \nOn the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. A 1990 update. Although most investigators now agree that chronic hyperglycemia is the basis for diabetic retinopathy, this has not been proven definitively. Even if chronic hyperglycemia is the initial common pathway leading to retinopathy and other complications of diabetes, it appears to act by different mechanisms in different tissues. The enzyme, aldose reductase, may play a major role in the development of diabetic retinopathy, but contradictory evidence exists. At the present time, results of the only study of aldose reductase inhibition and diabetic retinopathy reported in humans were negative. Another mechanism worthy of consideration is nonenzymatic glycation (glycosylation) of proteins, but there is no direct evidence of a causal role in diabetic retinopathy. Several growth factors have been identified in the retina that may promote neovascularization, and at least two inhibitors may prevent the process. There is evidence to support a role for basic and, perhaps, acidic fibroblast growth factors in retinal vasoproliferation. Transforming growth-factor beta, a peptide produced by capillary pericytes and smooth muscle cells and activated by the interaction of these cells with vascular endothelial cells, appears to be an important inhibitor of neovascularization, as is the vascular basement membrane. \nFemale urethra: MR imaging. The potential of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of the female urethra was studied in 64 patients. Spin-echo T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained in all 64 patients, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were also obtained in 27 patients. Urethral pathologic conditions, established with urethroscopy or histologic examination, or both, included urethral diverticula, inflammatory granuloma, and primary and metastatic neoplasms. On T2-weighted images, all normal urethras demonstrated a characteristic targetlike appearance with differentiation among the outer ring of low signal intensity, the middle zone of higher signal intensity, and the center of low signal intensity. After injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine, the targetlike appearance of the normal urethra was seen on the T1-weighted images. Urethral diverticula were detected with MR imaging in all nine patients with that diagnosis, and in each, MR imaging demonstrated urethral expansion, distortion of the zonal anatomy, and presence of fluid in the middle zone. Primary or metastatic urethral neoplasms were also detected with MR imaging in every patient with the diagnosis, but differentiation between benign and malignant disease was not possible. Local staging of primary or metastatic malignant disease was correct in eight of the 11 patients. In three patients, the inflammatory changes could not be differentiated from tumor invasion, resulting in overestimation of tumor extent. \nPurpura fulminans and adrenal hemorrhage due to group Y meningococcemia in an elderly woman. A 70-year-old previously healthy woman was admitted with a 1-day history of malaise, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, rigors, and confusion. She was found to be in septic shock with purpura fulminans and disseminated intravascular coagulation. She died within 36 hours of admission. Blood cultures grew Neisseria meningitidis group Y. Necropsy revealed evidence of shock and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. \nIntracardiac mobile thrombus and D-dimer fragment of fibrin in patients with mitral stenosis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the relation between intracardiac thrombus and blood coagulability in patients with mitral stenosis. DESIGN--Prospective study. Cross sectional echocardiography and plasma concentrations of the D-dimer fragment of fibrin were used concurrently to detect intracardiac thrombus in patients with mitral stenosis. SETTING--Department of Medicine, National Cardiovascular Centre, Osaka, Japan. PATIENTS--63 patients with mitral stenosis. None of them had been receiving any anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Plasma concentrations of D-dimer in patients with a mobile intracardiac thrombus, those in patients with a non-mobile intracardiac thrombus, and those in patients without an intracardiac thrombus. RESULTS--A mobile intracardiac thrombus was found in 10 patients and a non-mobile thrombus in eight. The remaining 45 patients had no intracardiac thrombi. Plasma concentrations of D-dimer in the 10 patients with a mobile thrombus were all greater than 300 ng/ml (mean 983.3, 95% confidence interval 498.9 to 1467.7 ng/ml) and they were significantly higher than those in the patients with a non-mobile thrombus (226.2, 33.6 to 418.8 ng/ml) and the patients without an intracardiac thrombus (147.2, 110.4 to 184 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS--A high plasma concentration of D-dimer seemed to reflect a hypercoagulable intracardiac state and may be a helpful indicator of the possible presence of mobile intracardiac thrombus in patients with mitral stenosis. \nProspective clinical and manometric study comparing pneumatic dilatation and sublingual nifedipine in the treatment of oesophageal achalasia. A study was carried out in 30 patients affected by a mild or moderate degree of oesophageal achalasia to compare the clinical and manometric effects of sublingual nifedipine and pneumatic dilatation. Sixteen patients were dilated twice with Rider-Moeller dilators and 14 were treated with sublingual nifedipine 10-20 mg 30 minutes before meals. A manometric evaluation was performed before and six months after starting treatment. The clinical evaluation (according to Vantrappen's criteria) was performed every three months for a mean follow up of 21 months. In both groups of patients a significant (p less than 0.001) fall in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was observed after treatment and excellent or good clinical results were observed in 75% of dilated patients and in 77% of patients treated with nifedipine. One patient could not tolerate nifedipine. No complications were observed after dilatation. It is concluded that longterm treatment with sublingual nifedipine and pneumatic dilatation are equally effective in the treatment of oesophageal achalasia of mild or moderate degree. \nMutations of the p53 gene in lymphoid leukemia. p53 is currently considered to be a tumor suppressor gene product, and its alterations are suggested to be involved in several human malignancies. Here we show evidence of the possible involvement of p53 gene mutations in lymphoid leukemias studied by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. Fourteen patients with various leukemias were examined and two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia were identified to have mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene. These mutations included point mutation, triplet deletion, and single nucleotide insertion. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected in the samples from these three patients. In one of them, chromosome 17p was deleted, suggesting the absence of the nonmutated p53 gene, whereas in the other two patients, chromosome 17p seemed to be intact by cytogenetic analysis. Our results suggest that alterations of the p53 gene may have a role in the genesis of some leukemias. \nChanges in quantitative SPECT thallium-201 results associated with the use of energy-weighted acquisition. The effect of utilizing energy-weighted acquisition on quantitative analysis of SPECT thallium-201 images was evaluated by simultaneously acquiring energy-weighted and windowed projection images in ten patients. The paired image sets were processed identically and evaluated by probability analysis of defect magnitude as indicated by a commercially available software analysis package. It was predicted that defect magnitude would increase as a result of improved image contrast. This was confirmed experimentally. One should be cautious in relying on strict quantitative criteria in cardiac studies with thallium-201, especially when major changes in the imaging system or technique are introduced. \nLymphomatous presentation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A subgroup at high risk of early treatment failure. Multivariate analyses of the clinical course of 1537 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identified a subgroup which experienced short remission duration and a high incidence of extramedullary relapse. The patients differed from other ALL patients by the presence at diagnosis of two or more of a constellation of clinical and laboratory features: organomegaly or mass disease, E-rosette positivity, hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dl, leukocyte count greater than 50,000/microliters, male predominance, and older age. This type of presentation of ALL is referred to as the \"lymphoma syndrome\" (LS) since such patients exhibit a pattern of several clinical and laboratory features which were observed repeatedly but in differing combinations, and some of which clinically resemble lymphoma. A subsequent database from 2231 patients was analyzed. Patients with a mediastinal mass, massive splenomegaly, or massive adenopathy, alone or in combination, had a worse outcome when the patient also had either leukocytosis, E-rosette-positive lymphoblasts, or a normal or near normal hemoglobin (Hb) level at diagnosis. Similarly, the above three laboratory features alone or in combination did not predict less than 40% disease-free survival (DFS) unless they were accompanied by at least one of the clinical features of mass disease. When at least one clinical feature and at least one laboratory feature were present, the overall DFS was 36% 6 years after diagnosis versus 64% for all other patients. The association of these features with poor prognosis remained significant after adjusting for the level of leukocyte count at diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and sex of the patients. Patients with this recurrent syndrome of features do not represent a homogeneous biologic entity but they constitute a subgroup of patients with ALL having a high risk of treatment failure using current therapies, including failure to achieve remission, early relapse, and increased frequency of relapse in extramedullary sites. They deserve early recognition at diagnosis and selection of treatment strategies appropriate for very high risk ALL. \nChronic xerostomia increases esophageal acid exposure and is associated with esophageal injury. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of chronic xerostomia on parameters of gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis. DESIGN: Observational study of a cohort of male patients with xerostomia and age-matched control subjects. SETTING: Tertiary-care Veterans Affairs Medical Center. SUBJECTS: Sixteen male patients with chronic xerostomia secondary to radiation for head and neck cancers or medications. Nineteen age-matched male control subjects with comparable alcohol and smoking histories. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Esophageal motility was similar in patients with xerostomia and controls. Clearance of acid from the esophagus and 24-hour intraesophageal pH were markedly abnormal in patients with xerostomia. Symptoms and signs of esophagitis were significantly more frequent in subjects with xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic xerostomia may predispose to esophageal injury, at least in part, by decreasing the clearance of acid from the esophagus and altering 24-hour intraesophageal pH. Esophageal injury is a previously unreported complication of long-term salivary deficiency. \nInsulin and glucagon therapy of acute hepatic failure. When insulin and glucagon are administered to rats with severe liver injury, survival is enhanced with an attenuation of the liver injury compared to that of untreated controls. In rats with acute liver injury both hormones produce a rapid normalization of hepatic protein content following initiation of DNA synthesis. When rats receive both hormones after partial hepatectomy, the first burst of DNA synthesis reaches a maximum earlier than that seen in controls. Both hormones enhance the increment of hepatic putrescine essential for DNA synthesis through activation of ornithine decaroxylase and/or spermidine-N1-acetyltransferase. The enhancement of putrescine content by each hormone is additive. Putrescine supplementation promotes hepatic DNA synthesis after hepatectomy. Based on these data, we conclude that a combination of insulin and glucagon is effective in the therapy of acute hepatic failure in rats. The restoration of liver function as well as the stimulation of liver cell proliferation via putrescine production may contribute to this effect. \nObesity, a disorder of nutrient partitioning: the MONA LISA hypothesis. The mechanisms underlying different types of obesity have been gradually clarified. Animal models with hypothalamic, genetic or dietary obesity have been examined with a feedback model. Four common final pathways are involved in this model. One of these final common pathways is the sympathetic nervous system. Most Obesities kNown Are Low In Sympathetic Activity states the MONA LISA Hypothesis. A second common pathway is the endocrine system involving adrenal glucocorticosteroids. The third common pathway is hyperphagia. Although not essential for most obesities, hyperphagia may be essential in animals with injury to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. The final pathway is reduced physical activity. The tonic activity of these systems and their response to changes in the diet affect nutrient partitioning between fat and protein. This framework has been used to review genetic obesity, hypothalamic obesity and dietary obesity. \nA double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of topical PUVA in persistent palmoplantar pustulosis. The effect of topical PUVA was investigated in the treatment of patients with persistent palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 27 patients with PPP there was an overall improvement of the hands and feet in both the active and placebo-treated areas and little difference between them. \nInitial two-year results of the Oregon Liver Transplantation Program. During the first 24 months of the Oregon Liver Transplantation Program, which began in October 1988, 94 patients were formally evaluated and 47 adults underwent 54 liver transplantations. Thirty-four percent of patients were veterans. The recipient operation lasted a mean of 7.4 hours (range: 4 to 16 hours). Veno-venous bypass was used routinely at first but selectively later (7 of the last 26 cases), resulting in reduced operating time. Hepatic artery reconstruction was end-to-end anastomosis in 52 cases and iliac conduit in 2. No arterial thrombosis occurred. Biliary reconstruction was choledochocholedochostomy in 83% and choledochojejunostomy in 17%. Biliary complications occurred in 28%. Operative mortality was 2%, and 1-year actual survival was 80%. Patients with hepatitis B fared worse, with four of six dying at a mean of 7.6 months. Overall, the median hospital stay was 30 days. Patients surviving more than 3 months had a mean Karnofsky score of 82%. No significant difference in outcome was noted in patients receiving prophylactic OKT3 monoclonal antibody (used in 45%) versus conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Overall, allograft rejection occurred in 55% of patients. Retransplantation was required in seven patients, three for primary graft nonfunction, two for uncontrolled rejection during induction therapy with OKT3, and two for graft failure secondary to recurrent hepatitis B. \nEvidence for a pathogenic linkage between glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis. Primary renal disease of immunologic or nonimmunologic mechanisms induces loss of substantial nephron population. It is presumed that the initial loss of functioning nephrons causes alterations of function and metabolism in remnant nephrons, which per se are self-inflictive, leading to further loss of nephrons. The ultimate outcome of this vicious cycle is the end-stage kidney. The potential role of various pathophysiologic mechanisms has been explored. These studies have shown a tight link between glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis. Analysis of individual glomeruli show a biphasic pattern of these two parameters. Early development of glomerular sclerosis takes place along with the hypertrophy of the glomerulus, and further advancement of sclerosis occurs with shrinkage in glomerular size. Thus, we propose that, after initial nephron loss, the remnant glomeruli are exposed to increased growth-promoting factors, which are self-inflictive in nature due to their capacity to produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix in the mesangial area. When the excessive matrix obliterates the glomerular capillary lumen, a typical sclerotic lesion appears. This is a vicious and accelerating process, since sclerosis induces further reduction in the nephron population, thereby imposing greater influence of growth-promoting factors even on glomeruli that are initially resistant. \nEndorectal sonography in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. Endorectal sonography initially was developed for evaluation of the prostate and now has been adapted for evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. We used endorectal sonography to evaluate a spectrum of diseases, including primary and recurrent rectal carcinoma, metastases, villous adenoma, leiomyosarcoma, endometriosis, sacrococcygeal teratoma, chordoma, retroperitoneal cystic hamartoma, pelvic lipomatosis, diverticulitis, and perirectal abscess. The technique has been useful in localization of perirectal abscesses and in sonographically guided biopsy of perirectal masses. Knowledge of normal sonographic anatomy of the rectum is essential in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. In this essay, we describe the technique of endorectal sonography and illustrate the sonographic findings in a variety of diseases. \nElectrophysiologic analysis of early Parkinson's disease. We have been interested in the application of quantitative measures of motor performance as a possible means of early detection of Parkinson's disease. To assess motor function, we have measured movement time (the physiologic correlate of bradykinesia) and reaction time (simple and directional choice) with an upper limb motor task, and tremor with accelerometry and electromyographic recordings. In this report we describe preliminary data from a Parkinson's disease patient group with symptoms of fewer than 2 years' average duration (compared with an age- and gender-matched normal control group) which indicate that precise, quantitative tests of motor function can detect the slight deviations from normal that are present in early Parkinson's disease. It appears that tests of bradykinesia are most sensitive, and detection of rest tremor is most specific. These tests may be applicable in screening individuals who are suspected of having or are \"at risk for\" Parkinson's disease and other related disorders. \nTotal replacement for post-traumatic arthritis of the elbow. Fifty-three of 55 consecutive elbow replacements for post-traumatic arthritis were followed for a minimum of two years (mean 6.3, range 2 to 14.4). The patients presented difficult management problems, having undergone an average of two previous operations per joint; 22 joints had suffered prior complications; 18 had less than 50 degrees of flexion and six were flail. One of three versions of the Coonrad prosthesis was employed in all. During the follow-up period, 10 patients underwent 14 revision procedures for aseptic loosening; 38 elbows are currently without progressive radiolucent lines. In two patients an elbow had to be resected, one for deep infection and the other for bone resorption following a foreign-body reaction to titanium. The current design of the Coonrad prosthesis offers a reliable option for the treatment of post-traumatic arthritis but should be used only in carefully selected patients over the age of 60 years. \nTotal excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection. Reports of high mortality and amputation rates following total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection have prompted the use of alternate approaches including local antibiotics, partial resection, in situ revascularization, and graft excision without revascularization. Experience with aortic graft infection was reviewed to establish current morbidity and mortality rates and evaluate our bias in favor of total excision and extra-anatomic bypass. Aortic graft infection was identified in 32 patients, 8 with aortoenteric fistulas. The mean interval between graft placement and infection was 34 months. History of groin exposure (75%) or multiple prior vascular surgery (50%) was common. Clinical signs included fever and/or leukocytosis (23 patients), false aneurysm (9 patients), graft thrombosis (6 patients), groin infection (11 patients), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (6 patients). Microbiologic data, available in 26 patients, demonstrated gram-positive organisms in 15 patients and gram-negative in 9. Multiple organisms were seen in 11 patients. Patients were treated by partial removal with (8 patients) or without (4 patients) revascularization or total removal with (18 patients) or without (2 patients) revascularization. Revascularization was by an extra-anatomic route, either simultaneous or staged. Overall morbidity/mortality was less in the revascularized groups (p = 0.01), while late complications were seen only after partial removal (p less than 0.01). The best results were found after total excision with revascularization. No patient in this group experienced late infection or amputation during a mean follow-up of 34 months (range: 1 to 168 months). Complications after total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection are lower than generally appreciated. This approach should remain the standard to which other approaches are compared. \nPrimary squamous cell carcinoma of a gastric remnant. A 77-yr-old male developed primary gastric squamous cell carcinoma 33 yr after gastric resection for peptic ulcer disease. At the time of diagnosis, he was being endoscopically followed for large irregular stomal polyps. Infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma with focal keratinization and stomal polypoid hypertrophic gastritis was found. Previous reports describe adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma in gastric remnants. There are various theories as to how such a tumor may arise in this setting. \nAcoustic neuroma: a cost-effective approach. A cost-effective approach to the diagnosis and treatment of acoustic neuromas continues to evolve as diagnostic methods improve. In the past 7 months, since gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become available in our practice, our screening and presurgical workup has changed. The purpose of this article is to outline the current philosophy of the senior authors in relation to acoustic neuroma management on the basis of 72 patients diagnosed from July 1988 to February 1989. With more sensitive diagnostic means, older less sensitive studies may be eliminated from the routine workup, thus maintaining cost-effectiveness while preserving the highest standard of patient care. The body of this article will review our current use of the many available diagnostic options and emphasize a cost-effective approach. \nAortic valve replacement with omniscience and omnicarbon valves. Clinical results achieved in 100 cases of aortic valve replacement with the Omniscience (O-S) valve during the period from 1980 to 1985 as well as 100 cases of aortic valve replacement with the Omnicarbon (O-C) valve during the period from 1985 to 1989 were studied. Concomitant surgical procedures including mitral valve replacement were performed in 63 patients in the O-S group and 67 patients in the O-C group. Cumulative follow-up in the two groups was carried out for a total of 559 and 273 patient-years, respectively. The overall 4-year actuarial survival rate was 82% +/- 3.8% in the O-S group and 89.5% +/- 3.2% in the O-C group, the corresponding rates for patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement being 82.9% +/- 4.2% in the O-S group and 91.9% +/- 3.5% in the O-C group. The overall 4-year actuarial event-free rate with respect to thromboembolic complications was 88.8% +/- 3.3% in the O-S group and 94.4% +/- 2.8% in the O-C group, as compared with the corresponding rates of 89.2% +/- 3.6% in the O-S group and 95.9% +/- 2.8% in the O-C group for patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement. The overall rate of valve-related complications, including thromboembolism, anticoagulant-related hemorrhage, perivalvular leak, infection, and structural failure, was 78.8% +/- 4.2% in the O-S group and 89.3% +/- 3.5% in the O-C group (p less than 0.05), and for isolated aortic valve replacement, 79.7% +/- 4.5% in the O-S group and 89.6% +/- 4.1% in the O-C group. \nResults of a multicenter study of the modified hook-titanium Greenfield filter. Initial efforts to modify the stainless steel Greenfield filter for percutaneous insertion led to development of a titanium Greenfield filter, which could be inserted by use of a 12F carrier. This device functioned well as a filter but had an unacceptable 30% rate of migration, tilting, and penetration. Therefore a titanium Greenfield filter with modified hooks was developed and has been tested in 186 patients at 10 institutions. Successful placement occurred in 181 (97%); placement of the remainder was precluded by unfavorable anatomy. A contraindication to anticoagulation was the most frequent indication for insertion (75%). All but two were inserted percutaneously, predominantly via the right femoral vein (70%). Initial incomplete opening was seen in four patients (2%), which was corrected by guide wire manipulation and asymmetry of the legs in 10 (5.4%). Insertion site hematoma occurred in one patient, and apical penetration of the cava during insertion occurred in a second patient. Both events were without sequelae. Follow-up examinations were performed at 30 days at which time 35 deaths had occurred. Recurrent embolism was suspected in six patients (3%) and two of three deaths were confirmed by autopsy. Filter movement greater than 9 mm was seen in 13 patients, (11%) and increase in base diameter greater than or equal to 5 mm was seen in 17 patients (14%). CT scanning showed evidence of caval penetration in only one patient (0.8%). Insertion site venous thrombosis was seen in 4/46 (8.7%) patients screened. The modified hook titanium Greenfield filter is inserted percutaneously or operatively through a sheath, eliminating concern for misplacement from premature discharge. \nColonic complications after toxic tribal enemas. Tribal enemas obtained from traditional healers are used widely in Southern Africa for a variety of indications. Inclusion of injurious substances such as potassium dichromate may cause serious colonic and renal complications. Nine such patients, in seven of whom chromate use was confirmed, presented after a mean delay of 7.3 days. All patients had bloody diarrhoea and vomiting and three underwent major colonic resection, requiring a total of ten procedures. One patient suffered mechanical perforation of the rectum, with subsequent necrotizing fasciitis, necessitating rectal excision. Eight patients had acute renal failure and seven required dialysis. One patient died. At follow-up one patient has chronic renal failure and only three are completely well. Although local medical practitioners are aware of the problem, the challenge of preventing harmful cultural practices remains. \nIntradermal hepatitis B vaccination. The availability of vaccine since 1982 for immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has had minimal impact on the disease; mass immunization has been suggested. Intradermal vaccination, which has precedent in prophylaxis of other infectious diseases, has been investigated as a low-cost alternative to traditional intramuscular HBV vaccination. Results of open and comparative trials indicate similar seroconversion rates for intradermal and intramuscular HBV vaccination routes in healthy adults. However, antibody titers and, presumably, duration of antibody protection appear to be decreased with intradermal HBV vaccination. Limited data suggest that demographic factors such as age and gender may affect vaccine responsiveness to intradermal HBV vaccine. Adverse skin reactions are common but do not represent a deterrent to continued intradermal HBV vaccination. There is a need for large-scale prospective comparative trials to substantiate the value of intradermal HBV vaccination. Nevertheless, the potential economic and epidemiologic benefit of intradermal vaccination justifies continued investigation for prevention of HBV infection. \nMeckel cave lesions: percutaneous fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology. The authors describe the novel combination of two traditional methods to facilitate diagnosis of Meckel cave lesions, which may otherwise require craniotomy to obtain adequate tissue samples. Fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology was performed on tissue obtained with a percutaneous approach via the foramen ovale with use of fluoroscopic guidance and intravenous analgesia during an outpatient procedure. This new application of fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology results in decreased patient morbidity and significant cost reduction. \nAudit of outpatients: entering the loop. OBJECTIVE--To develop and test a method for routine data collection to observe current practice in outpatient pain clinics. DESIGN--Prospective questionnaire survey completed by consultants on each patient seen during October 1989 to May 1990. SETTING--Outpatient pain clinics of five teaching and five district general hospitals in Scotland and northern England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of new referrals and their source, and characteristics of pain at presentation. RESULTS--4354 forms were completed by 21 consultants over 29 weeks, corresponding to 2241 patients, of whom 981 were new referrals. The proportion of consultations at which new referrals were seen varied among the 10 clinics from 15% to 34%. The difference could not be accounted for by type of hospital. Sources of new referrals varied widely between the clinics (for example, range 22% to 78% for general practitioner referrals), as did new referrals by the type of pain (range 10.8% to 55.2% for low back pain, 10.5% to 32.5% for pain associated with surgery). However, these differences in types of patients seen could not be accounted for by variations in referral patterns among clinics. Problems identified in performing an audit of outpatients included the difficulty of obtaining firm diagnoses, the need for a method to link successive patient contacts, and the complexity of the presenting problem in many patients. CONCLUSIONS--It is possible to collect data for audit routinely in outpatient clinics. Observation of current practice in the clinics suggested possible unmet need or inappropriate management, which may require changes in practice. \nIndications and limitations of aortic valve reconstruction. To elucidate the value of conservative operation for aortic regurgitation, all consecutive patients operated on between July 1988 and July 1990 were reviewed. Of 251 patients with aortic regurgitation, 107 (42.6%) had nonprosthetic operation. The mean age was 23 years, and 90 patients (84.1%) were rheumatic. Two techniques were used: repair (annular and leaflet plasties, 69 cases) and cusp extension with glutaraldehyde-treated pericardium (25 bovine, 13 autologous). There were two hospital deaths (1.8%), both in the repair group, and no late deaths or embolic events. Only 5 patients (4.7%) were anticoagulated. In the repair group there were 12 reoperations, four (5.9%) due to aortic and eight to mitral dysfunction. In the cusp extension group there were two reoperations due to mitral dysfunction. Echocardiographic follow-up showed better results with cusp extension. In conclusion, conservative operation for aortic regurgitation is possible in a high percentage of young rheumatic patients and does not require anticoagulation. Cusp extension is more reliable than repair in terms of early results, although its long-term durability is not yet known. \nInfluence of human immunodeficiency virus infection on cell-mediated immunity in chronic D hepatitis. To determine whether the abnormalities of cell-mediated immunity described in chronic D hepatitis are associated with hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection or concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, serologic and tissue hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV markers and T lymphocyte subsets were studied in serum samples from 38 patients with chronic D hepatitis, 26 of whom had HIV infection. Patients with chronic D hepatitis and HIV infection had significantly lower peripheral blood T4:T8 ratios resulting from a significant increase in T8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells, while numbers of T lymphocyte subsets were normal in cases with chronic D hepatitis only. HIV+ patients showed an increase in HBV replication (identified by hepatitis B core antigen in liver and hepatitis B e antigen and HBV DNA in serum) and in HDV replication (tissue D antigen and HDV RNA) without evidence of more active liver disease. Probably the immunologic disturbances detected in chronic D hepatitis are secondary to HIV infection, do not contribute to the pathogenesis of liver injury, and are associated with increased viral B and D replication. \nDifferential diagnosis of head and neck lesions based on their space of origin. 2. The infrahyoid portion of the neck. The infrahyoid portion of the neck can be considered as a series of contiguous fascial planes and intervening spaces that lend themselves well to axial imaging. These spaces can serve as a basis on which to formulate differential diagnoses for diseases in this region. This pictorial essay describes the fascia and fascial spaces of the infrahyoid portion of the neck. The contents of each space, the common abnormalities affecting the space, and the characteristic displacements produced by disease in each space are reviewed. \nCongestive heart failure symptoms in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function: analysis of the CASS registry. The clinical characteristics and long-term survival of 284 patients from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) registry data base who had moderate to severe congestive heart failure symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.45 were studied. A control group consisting of registry patients with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.45 who did not have heart failure was used for comparison. Patients who had heart failure were older and more likely to be female and to have a higher incidence of hypertension, diabetes and chronic lung disease than registry patients who did not have heart failure. As a group, patients with heart failure had more severe angina and were more likely to have had a prior myocardial infarction than were registry patients without heart failure. At 6 year follow-up, 82% of patients in the heart failure group survived compared with 91% of patients in the control group (p less than 0.0001). Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model identified the following independent predictors of mortality: regional ventricular systolic dysfunction, number of diseased coronary arteries, advanced age, hypertension, lung disease, diabetes, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and heart failure symptoms. Among patients with heart failure, the 6-year survival rate of those who had three-vessel coronary artery disease was 68% compared with 92% for the group without coronary artery disease. However, the 6-year survival rate for patients with heart failure who underwent surgical revascularization of diseased coronary arteries was not significantly improved compared with that of patients treated medically. \nCarcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract: prognostic factors and disease outcome. This study represents retrospective analysis of 87 patients with a carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract seen and followed in the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) from 1960 to 1986. In 49 cases, the primary site was the small bowel. The rest of the cases were distributed as follows: 11 appendix, 10 rectum, 5 stomach, and 7 undetermined. We extrapolated the Dukes' and modified Astler-Coller surgicopathological classifications used for colorectal cancer for use in our cases of carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract. A strong correlation was found, using this staging, with disease-specific survival. Other prognostic factors included histologic differentiation, the presence of macroscopic residual disease after initial surgery, and level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in urine. Among 51 patients with surgically grossly removed disease, there was a tendency for the development of distant and distant/locoregional recurrence more often than locoregional recurrence alone. The liver was the commonest site of distant recurrence. Analysis of the effect of radiotherapy or chemotherapy on carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract proved unsuccessful because only a small portion of the patients had this treatment, and it was used mainly for palliation. \nContemporary management of neurofibromatosis. The neurofibromatoses are two distinct entities with different genetic origins. The phenotypic expressions and required treatments are different. The devastating nature of neurofibromatosis-2 may be more effectively controlled through the application of advanced imaging techniques and contemporary neurotologic procedures. The most common manifestation of neurofibromatosis-2 is that of bilateral acoustic neuromas. The eventual total bilateral sensorineural deafness associated with this condition can be obviated in selected cases if the diagnosis is established early. Follow-up data are reported for three patients in whom hearing was preserved in at least one ear. When removal with hearing preservation is not possible, subtotal tumor removal with decompression of the internal auditory canals may delay progression of hearing loss. A new approach to tumors of the pterygomaxillary fossa that have extended to the middle cranial fossa has been successfully applied and is described. \nGrowth hormone deficiency following radiation therapy of primary brain tumors in children. The medical records of 123 patients treated for brain tumors at Children's Hospital and Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, between 1985 and 1987 were reviewed. The endocrinological complications of radiation therapy and the effectiveness of growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy were assessed. These were the first 2 years after synthetic GH became available. The disease pathology was confirmed at craniotomy or biopsy in 108 patients. Ninety-five children completed radiation therapy and 65 of these were alive at the time of review; these 65 children represent the study population. The most common tumor types were medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, and ependymoma. Endocrine evaluation was initiated with changes in the patients' growth velocity. Patient workup included skeletal x-ray films for determination of bone and analysis of thyroxin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and somatomedin-C levels. Following 1-dopa and clonidine stimulation, provocative studies of GH levels were performed. Growth hormone failure and short stature were observed in 26 children, most commonly in the 2nd year after tumor treatment. Eight patients with GH failure were also hypothyroid. Hormone replacement therapy was initiated with recombinant GH, 0.05 mg/kg/day, and all children so treated showed an increase in height, with eight patients experiencing catch-up growth. There were no complications of therapy or tumor recurrence. Studies of baseline bone age and somatomedin-C levels on completion of radiation therapy are recommended. Comprehensive endocrine studies should follow changes in the patients' growth velocity. With early GH replacement, catch-up growth is possible and normal adult heights may be achieved. \nSubarachnoid hemorrhage in sickle-cell disease. The neurological complications of sickle-cell disease include cerebral intracerebral hemorrhage; subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been infrequently reported. Among 325 patients with sickle-cell disease followed at the University of Illinois between 1975 and 1989, 11 cases of SAH were identified. Aneurysms were found in 10 of these patients, three of whom had multiple aneurysms. All of the patients had some degree of anemia and nine underwent craniotomy without hematological or neurological complications. From this review it appears that SAH is not uncommon in sickle-cell disease patients and tends to occur at a younger age and with smaller aneurysm size than in the general population. With proper perioperative management, including exchange transfusions to reduce the proportion of hemoglobin S to less than 30%, these patients can undergo angiography and craniotomy without an increased incidence of complications. The techniques used in managing sickle-cell disease patients with SAH are discussed. \nSelective expression of CD45 isoforms defines CALLA+ monoclonal B-lineage cells in peripheral blood from myeloma patients as late stage B cells. The peripheral blood lymphocytes from 42 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and 13 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) were studied by three-color immunofluorescence (IF) using antibodies directed to a broad range of B-cell markers (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD24), CALLA (CD10), PCA-1 (a plasma cell marker), and to the high and low molecular weight isoforms of the leukocyte common antigen, CD45RA (p205/220) and CD45RO (p 180). CD45RA is expressed on pre-B and B cells, and a transition from CD45RA to CD45RO defines differentiation towards plasma cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with myeloma included a large subset of B-lineage cells (mean of 39% to 45%) that were CALLA+ and PCA-1+ in all patients studied, including newly diagnosed patients and patients undergoing chemotherapy. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of monoclonal Ig rearrangements in PBMC and a substantial reduction in the germ-line bands consistent with the presence of a large monoclonal B-cell subset. Avoidance of purification methods involving depletion of adherent cells was essential for detection of the abnormal B cells. Phenotypically, this abnormal B-cell population corresponded to late B or early pre-plasma cells (20% to 80% of PBMC), as defined by the concomitant expression of low densities of CD19 and CD20, moderate densities of CALLA and PCA-1, and strong expression of CD45RO on all B cells, with weakly coexpressed CD45RA on a small proportion. Heterogeneity in the expression of CD45RA and CD45RO within the abnormal B-cell population from any given patient suggested multiple differentiation stages. Abnormal B cells similar to those in MM were also detected in MGUS, although as a lower proportion of PBMC (26%). Abnormal B cells from patients with MGUS expressed predominantly the CD45RO isoform, but had a lower proportion of CALLA+ and PCA-1+ cells than were found on B cells from MM. This work indicates that the large subset of circulating monoclonal B lymphocytes from myeloma patients are at a late stage in B-cell differentiation, continuously progressing towards the plasma cell stage. \nPreventing heel ulcers: a comparison of prophylactic body-support systems. Five commercially available body-support systems used in the prevention of decubitus heel ulcers were objectively compared for their capacity to dissipate or decrease pressure concentration at the most prominent posterior aspect of the heel in bedridden, insensate patients. The Foot Drop Stop, a foam heel suspender, completely eliminated contact between the heel and the bed, and it was the most successful in decreasing pressure concentration. The space boot and foam heel protectors were far more successful than sheepskin rugs or polyester heel protectors, which provided little protection to the prominent heel. \nUnilateral hydrocephalus: prenatal sonographic diagnosis. We studied six cases of unilateral hydrocephalus detected prenatally to analyze the sonographic features of the abnormality and to determine the cause and clinical outcome. In all cases, third-trimester sonograms showed marked unilateral lateral ventriculomegaly (mean atrial width, 4.4 cm) and normal contralateral lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. Five of the six cases had marked thinning of the cortical mantle on the affected side and shift of midline structures to the contralateral side. The causes of unilateral hydrocephalus were agenesis or stenosis of the foramen of Monro in three cases, transient obstruction of the foramen in one fetus with an intraventricular hematoma, underlying brain dysplasia in one fetus with a variant of holoprosencephaly, and undetermined in one case. All six neonates had placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter; four of these have had normal cognitive development at follow-up. The remaining two infants have moderate to severe developmental impairment. Unilateral hydrocephalus is a rare anomaly that can be recognized by prenatal sonography. Even though unilateral ventriculomegaly may be marked, early diagnosis and treatment may result in a favorable clinical outcome. \nAn overview of ankle arthrodesis. Arthrodesis of the ankle can result in a painless, normal walking gait. However, complications in ankle arthrodesis can be major, and can occur when anatomy, deformity, or bony deficiency is not properly addressed. Nonoperative treatment should always be considered first, and, if possible, an open or arthroscopic ankle debridement can provide significant pain relief. Arthrodesis should be considered after conservative treatment fails. Infections, deformity, sensory deficiencies, and bony defects require special consideration. The use of bone graft and internal or external compression will enhance the likelihood of a successful arthrodesis. \nGlandular odontogenic cyst: clinicopathologic analysis of three cases. The glandular odontogenic cyst is a rare cyst of odontogenic origin, first described in 1988 by Gardner et al. Three previously unreported glandular odontogenic cysts are presented; none recurred after the initial surgical treatment, and one example was associated with a squamous odontogenic tumor-like proliferation in the wall. Ten similar cases were found in the literature, and their clinical and roentgenographic features, and follow-up, have been compared with the present cases. \nProgression of scleral disease. The clinical features of 290 patients with scleral inflammation were reviewed to determine whether a classification based on the anatomical site and clinical appearance of the disease at presentation reflected its natural history. The authors' results confirm that the majority of patients remain in the same clinical category throughout the course of their disease. Of the 104 (35.9%) patients who experienced a recurrence of their disease, only 12 had progressed from diffuse to nodular disease, and 10 patients who originally had nodular disease developed scleral necrosis. Patients with necrotizing scleritis were older than patients in the other groups and more frequently had an associated systemic disease than patients with either diffuse or nodular disease; necrotizing scleritis was the most difficult disease to treat. Diffuse anterior scleritis had a lower incidence of visual loss (9%) than either nodular scleritis (26%) or necrotizing disease (74%), and, therefore, the authors consider nodular scleritis a disease of intermediate severity between diffuse scleritis and necrotizing disease. In this series, 12% of patients presented with posterior scleritis, and visual loss was most frequent in this group (84%). \nAntihypertensive drug treatment. Potential, expected, and observed effects on stroke and on coronary heart disease. The effects of prolonged differences in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on the risks of stroke and of coronary heart disease (CHD) were estimated from nine major prospective observational studies involving about 420,000 men and women who were followed up for intervals of 6-25 years. The results indicate that a prolonged difference of about 6 mm Hg in DBP was associated with approximately 37% fewer strokes and 23% fewer CHD deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. The effects of equivalent reductions in DBP produced by antihypertensive drug treatment but maintained for only a few years have been estimated in several overviews of randomized trials involving a total of 30,000-40,000 patients. The results of the overviews indicate that treatment reduced the risk of stroke by about 40%, suggesting that most or all the long-term potential benefits for stroke due to lower DBP were achieved within about 3 years of beginning treatment. The risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death may have been reduced by about 10% among patients allocated to active treatment; the 95% confidence limits for the difference ranged from about zero to about 20%. Whatever the true effect of treatment on CHD, it would appear somewhat less than the difference in risk estimated from the observational studies for a prolonged difference in DBP of the same size. This apparent shortfall in benefit may reflect a long time-course for changes in DBP to have their full effects on CHD, possible adverse side effects of the principal trial treatments, or both. \nEffect of ventilation with soluble and diffusible gases on the size of air emboli. Pulmonary hypertension resulting from venous air embolism is known to increase after ventilation with highly soluble and diffusible gases. Exacerbation of the hypertension could be due to further blockage of the circulation if the bubbles enlarge as a result of ingress of gas by diffusion. This mechanism has been frequently cited but lacks direct proof. To determine directly whether intravascular air bubbles actually enlarge when highly soluble and diffusible gases are inspired, we used microscopy to measure the size of gas emboli in vivo. When air bubbles were injected into the right atrium, the bubbles that appeared in pulmonary arterioles were larger during ventilation with helium or nitrous oxide than with air. Air bubbles injected into the pulmonary artery enlarged when the inspired gas was changed to helium or nitrous oxide. The direction, magnitude, and timing of changes in bubble size were consistent with a net diffusion of gas into the bubbles. These data support the idea that venous air emboli enlarge during ventilation with soluble and diffusible gases and thereby cause further vascular obstruction. \nPlatelet activation in the pathogenesis of unstable angina: importance in determining the response to plasminogen activators. Unstable angina is a clinical syndrome of recurrent myocardial ischemia. In some cases, this reflects episodic platelet activation and coronary thrombosis. Thus, the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2, which is largely derived from activated platelets, is increased, often coincident with chest pain. The major role of platelets in unstable angina may influence the response to plasminogen activators. Platelets increase the resistance of thrombi to lysis, by inducing clot retraction and cross-linking and by releasing inhibitors. Thus, coronary thrombi in unstable angina may be resistant to lysis. Furthermore, both t-PA and streptokinase cause platelet activation and thrombin formation in vivo, possibly via plasmin. Plasmin can activate platelets and factor V directly. These prothrombotic effects of plasminogen activators may limit their activity in unstable angina. At the very least, their therapeutic efficacy may be highly dependent on the coadministration of potent antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. \nViral hepatitis. The new ABC's. Hepatitis may be caused by hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (classic non-A non-B viral hepatitis), hepatitis D virus (delta agent), and hepatitis E virus (epidemic non-A non-B viral hepatitis). Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus may also occasionally cause hepatitis. Some forms of hepatitis carry the risks of chronic infection, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment options for viral hepatitis are limited and, in many cases, still under investigation. Prophylaxis is available for many forms of hepatitis and should be offered to those at risk. \nReversal of protein-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption with antibiotics in atrophic gastritis. The role of bacteria in the bioavailability of protein-bound vitamin B12 was examined in eight elderly subjects who had atrophic gastritis and in eight normal controls. On separate days and in random order, vitamin B12 absorption tests were performed using either radiolabeled crystalline or protein-bound vitamin B12. At the same time, bacterial samples were collected from the upper gastrointestinal tract. The tests and gastrointestinal aspirates were performed before and during tetracycline therapy. Crystalline vitamin B12 was absorbed to the same extent in the two study groups. Atrophic gastritis subjects absorbed significantly less protein-bound vitamin B12 than normal controls (mean +/- SEM, 0.7% +/- 0.2% vs. 1.9% +/- 0.5%, respectively). However, protein-bound vitamin B12 absorption in these subjects normalized after antibiotic therapy. These results suggest that the small amounts of vitamin B12 released from the protein binders is readily absorbed (as shown in vitro) and/or metabolized by bacteria. \nTelangiectatic osteosarcoma. Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is a rare variant of osteosarcoma. In the original report from the authors' institution, a poor prognosis was noted. The authors have updated their experience with this entity. The prognosis for patients with telangiectatic osteosarcoma has improved remarkably. The prognosis in the present series seems to be the same as that for conventional osteosarcoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy seems to help in salvaging patients with metastatic disease. However, in this small series, survival of patients without metastasis is apparently not influenced by whether they received chemotherapy. \nLarge vessel occlusion with vasculitis in systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients with SLE may have acute large vessel occlusion due to vasculitis and/or circulating antiphospholipid antibodies, as illustrated by the case we have reported. Unfortunately, delayed medical attention led to gangrene of the foot and amputation. Early recognition and appropriate treatment may significantly decrease morbidity and mortality. Medical treatment may include corticosteroids, thrombolysis, anticoagulation, or immunosuppression. \nAngiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Present and future. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibiting agents have emerged with the diuretic agents, beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents, and calcium antagonists as therapeutic options for major consideration during the initial treatment of hypertensive patients. These compounds antagonize a potent pressor mechanism underlying hypertensive disease. The ACE inhibitors curtail the generation of the potent octapeptide angiotensin II; in addition, degradation of the potent vasodilator bradykinin is inhibited. Hemodynamically, ACE inhibitors reduce arterial pressure through a decreased total peripheral resistance that is unassociated with reflex stimulation of the heart or expansion of intravascular volume. The arteriolar dilation accounting for the decreased vascular resistance seems to occur in each target organ of the disease. Unlike the direct-acting smooth muscle vasodilators or adrenergic inhibitors, ACE inhibitors dilate the efferent as well as the afferent glomerular arterioles and thereby reduce glomerular hydrostatic pressure and renal filtration fraction, even though renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are preserved. The ACE-inhibiting compounds not only reduce left ventricular afterload in hypertension but also diminish cardiac mass and wall thicknesses. The mechanism(s) for some of these actions have not yet been defined precisely, but they undoubtedly involve the autocrine/paracrine actions of the renopressor system and their effects in the cellular biologic events of vascular smooth muscle and the cardiac myocyte. It seems plausible and exciting that the \"more local\" renin-angiotensin systems will be exploited by those ACE inhibitors yet to be synthesized, which will result in new applications for this class of pharmacological agents. \nUse of Valsalva maneuver to unmask left ventricular diastolic function abnormalities by Doppler echocardiography in patients with coronary artery disease or systemic hypertension. It has been suggested that changes in left atrial pressure may mask or mimic left ventricular diastolic function abnormalities detected by Doppler echocardiography. The effect of the Valsalva maneuver on the transmitral flow velocity profile was therefore studied in 28 patients without evidence of coronary artery disease (group 1, mean age +/- standard deviation 50 +/- 8 years) and in 94 patients with evidence of coronary artery disease or systemic hypertension (group 2, mean age 54 +/- 10 years). At baseline, group 2 patients had higher peak late diastolic filling velocity (A), lower peak early (E) to late diastolic filling velocity (E/A) ratio and longer isovolumic relaxation time than group 1, whereas heart rate, E velocity and E deceleration time were similar in both groups. During Valsalva, both groups had similar increases in heart rate and similar decreases in E velocity but E/A ratio decreased significantly only in group 2 because of a lesser decrease in A velocity. The E/A ratio was greater than or equal to 1.0 both before and during Valsalva in all but 1 patient in group 1, whereas in group 2, 32 patients had E/A greater than or equal to 1.0 at rest and during Valsalva, 33 patients had E/A greater than or equal to 1.0 at rest but less than 1.0 both at rest and during Valsalva. Using group 1 as controls, prevalence, specificity and positive predictive value of E/A less than 1.0 in group 2 were 31, 100 and 100% at rest and 66, 96 and 98% during Valsalva. \nMembrane cerebral lipids in Rett syndrome. The lipid membrane composition of cerebral tissue from 5 patients with classic Rett syndrome, ages 12-30 years, and from 14 age-matched controls was studied. The results demonstrated a selective loss of myelin-associated lipids and an enrichment of gangliosides in temporal white matter. The ganglioside pattern revealed an increase of astroglial cell-associated gangliosides and reduced proportions of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b. This latter finding may be crucial in synaptic function. The fatty acid compositions of ethanolamine phosphoglyceride, choline phosphoglyceride, and galactosylceramide were normal. \nEffect of respiratory muscle fatigue on subsequent exercise performance. The purpose of this study was to determine whether induction of inspiratory muscle fatigue might impair subsequent exercise performance. Ten healthy subjects cycled to volitional exhaustion at 90% of their maximal capacity. Oxygen consumption, breathing pattern, and a visual analogue scale for respiratory effort were measured. Exercise was performed on three separate occasions, once immediately after induction of fatigue, whereas the other two episodes served as controls. Fatigue was achieved by having the subjects breathe against an inspiratory threshold load while generating 80% of their predetermined maximal mouth pressure until they could no longer reach the target pressure. After induction of fatigue, exercise time was reduced compared with control, 238 +/- 69 vs. 311 +/- 96 (SD) s (P less than 0.001). During the last minute of exercise, oxygen consumption and heart rate were lower after induction of fatigue than during control, 2,234 +/- 472 vs. 2,533 +/- 548 ml/min (P less than 0.002) and 167 +/- 15 vs. 177 +/- 12 beats/min (P less than 0.002). At exercise isotime, minutes ventilation and the visual analogue scale for respiratory effort were larger after induction of fatigue than during control. In addition, at exercise isotime, relative tachypnea was observed after induction of fatigue. We conclude that induction of inspiratory muscle fatigue can impair subsequent performance of high-intensity exercise and alter the pattern of breathing during such exercise. \nEffect of temporary occlusion of hypogastric arteries on blood loss during radical retropubic prostatectomy. We report on a prospective, partially randomized study of 130 patients, examining the effect of temporary occlusion of the hypogastric arteries on intraoperative blood loss, perioperative blood replacement and change in preoperative to postoperative hematocrit. We observed no significant difference in any of these parameters when comparing patients who did and did not undergo intraoperative occlusion of the hypogastric arteries. These findings suggest that temporary occlusion of the hypogastric arteries during radical prostatectomy does not have a major effect on the blood loss associated with this operation. Extensive collateral circulation to the prostate and a substantial venous component of blood loss may explain these findings. Banking of 3 units of autologous blood preoperatively would have decreased the need for homologous transfusions in the majority of patients. \nCross-resistance patterns in ACNU-resistant glioma sublines in culture. Three ACNU-resistant clones (R1, R3, and R12) were isolated from 9L rat glioma cells under selection pressure of ACNU in vitro. The authors have investigated the mechanisms of resistance and characteristics of these clones at the cellular level by studying cross-resistance patterns to chemical and physical agents. Although these resistant sublines showed complete cross-resistance to methyl-chloroethylnitrosourea (MCNU), no cross-resistance was observed for other alkylating agents, while each of the resistant sublines showed partial cross-resistance to structurally dissimilar toxic agents (vinblastine, Adriamycin, and VP-16). No difference in ACNU uptake was observed between 9L and R3 cells, and resistance patterns among alkylating agents suggested that the mechanism of ACNU resistance was specific to bifunctional nitrosoureas. Based on a transport study, this multidrug resistance could be explained by reduced intracellular uptake of these drugs, but there seemed little possibility that membrane P-glycoprotein, which usually is observed in typical multidrug-resistant cells, was expressed in these ACNU-resistant cells because enhanced drug efflux was not found in ACNU-resistant sublines. Significant collateral sensitivity to L-asparaginase indicated that ACNU might disturb the asparagine synthetic pathways by its mutagenic action. The increased level of total glutathione in the resistant sublines may be one mechanism of radiation or ACNU resistance. \nCervicofacial cystic hygroma. Patterns of recurrence and management of the difficult case. Cystic hygromas usually present in infancy or early childhood as compressible masses that may rapidly and intermittently enlarge. While they may arise in any anatomic location, hygromas of the head and neck are especially difficult to manage since enlargement may cause serious sequela such as airway obstruction, feeding difficulties, and speech pathology. Complete extirpation of these lesions is often impossible, and recurrence rates are accordingly high. We reviewed our 10-year experience in treating cervicofacial cystic hygromas. Of 34 patients, 21 had lesions cephalad to the hyoid and 13 had lesions caudal to the hyoid. While none of the 13 children with infrahyoid lesions demonstrated feeding or respiratory difficulties, eight of 21 children with suprahyoid involvement presented with dysphagia or airway compromise. The recurrence rates for infrahyoid and suprahyoid lesions were 15% and 81%, respectively. Those children with suprahyoid hygromas also experienced an increased operative complication rate compared with patients with infrahyoid involvement. Principles of management for suprahyoid and infrahyoid lesions are described, including the specific management of lingual, submandibular, parotid, and parotofacial hygromas. \nCan essential hypertension be subclassified with respect to mechanism? Hypertension may result from a variety of abnormalities. The rise in blood pressure may trigger other secondary events that further influence cardiovascular homeostasis. The ability to measure some markers associated with hypertension or the responsiveness of blood pressure to nutritional interventions or to specific therapeutic agents may also have pathogenetic implications. The ultimate goal of further knowledge in this area should be to understand the fundamental abnormalities responsible for hypertension. Such insight would permit more effective treatment and, perhaps, primary prevention of this ubiquitous and multifaceted disorder. \nEffectiveness of imazodan for treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. The Imazodan Research Group. A 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of imazodan, a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was conducted in 147 patients with congestive heart failure to determine clinical efficacy and safety. Patients were randomized to placebo or 2, 5 or 10 mg of imazodan administered twice daily. Patients were maintained on their standard therapy including diuretics, digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The mean ejection fraction was 23 +/- 10%. Exercise time increased from baseline in all 4 groups. There was no significant difference observed between the placebo group and any of the treated groups with regard to exercise time, ejection fraction, frequency of ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia. When analyzed by intent to treat, the placebo mortality was 7% (3 of 44) and the imazodan mortality was 8% (8 of 103) (p = not significant). This study failed to demonstrate that imazodan provided any benefit in exercise performance when compared with placebo. \nThe anal continence plug: a disposable device for patients with anorectal incontinence. Anorectal incontinence is most commonly found in the elderly, but colorectal surgeons now see an increasing number of younger patients with this condition. Although medical and surgical treatments are available, a proportion of patients remain refractory to therapy. We investigated the efficacy of three designs of anal continence plug. 8 women and 2 men (mean age, 52 years) who were incontinent to both liquid and solid stool tested each plug for three consecutive weeks. 1 patients withdrew from the study. The median weartime for the optimum plug design was 12 h, and there were no episodes of incontinence in 82% of the periods during which the plug was in place. Patients required a median of eleven plugs per week, and in 82% of cases insertion was as easy as with a suppository. Plugs may have a place in the management of patients with anorectal incontinence. \nA review of californium-252 neutron brachytherapy for cervical cancer. Since 1976 a clinical trial has been conducted to test the feasibility, the potential, and to develop methods for using the neutron-emitting radioactive isotope, californium-252 (Cf-252), for the treatment of cervical cancer. A total of 218 patients were treated in the initial study period from 1976 until 1983. The trials initially treated advanced (Stages III and IV) cervical cancer patients using different doses and schedules; they were extended to include unfavorable presentations of Stages I and II because of favorable results in the initial trials. The authors began to treat patients with Stage IB bulky or barrel-shaped tumors and the majority were treated with both radiation and hysterectomy. Actuarial survival was determined for Stage IB disease and was 87% at 5 years and 82% at 10 years. For those tested with preoperative radiation it was 92% at 5 and 87% at 10 years. For Stage II, it was 62% 5 years and 61% at 10. Survival 5 years after combined radiation and surgical therapy for Stage II disease was 68%. For Stage III, it was 33% at 5 years and 25% at 10. However, 5-year survival using the early neutron implant was 46% versus approximately 19% for delayed Cf-252 or cesium 137. Different schedules and sequences of neutrons and photons greatly altered outcome. Neutron treatment before external photon therapy was better for all stages of disease. Only about 5% of all patients developed complications after neutron therapy. No hematologic or mesenchymal second tumors were observed. Neutron brachytherapy was found to be very effective for producing rapid response and greatly improved local control of bulky, barrel, or advanced cervical cancers. The clinical trial identified and evolved schedules, doses, doses per session, and developed methods different from standard photon therapy but highly effective for local control and cure of cervical cancers of all stages. Clinical and radiobiologic understanding for the use of neutron therapy was greatly advanced by this trial. Future trials will focus on patients with advanced disease and will require evaluation of adjuvant chemotherapy studies and neutron-enhancing chemicals. \nComparison of polyamide and polypropylene membranes for plasma separation. Plasma separation experiments were made with polyamide experimental prototype hollow-fiber plasma filters with surface areas between 0.025 m2 and 0.1090 m2 using bovine blood collected in acid citrate dextrose (ACD). The maximum filtration velocity rose with the wall shear rate gamma w as gamma w 0.72 +/- 0.02 and decreased with the length of fiber L as L-0.41 with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 +/- 0.02. The results were similar to those with polypropylene fibers. We also investigated the occurrence of hemolysis as a function of shear rate and transmembrane pressure. The free hemoglobin concentration of filtered plasma was checked using a U.V. spectrophotometer. It was concluded that polyamide membrane filters can be safely used for plasma separation from blood. \nThe relationship of chemotherapeutic and endocrine intervention on natural killer cell activity in human breast cancer. Peripheral blood natural killer (NK) activity against K562 target tumor cells was monitored in patients with breast cancer receiving no treatment, combination chemotherapy, and/or endocrine therapy. NK activity in untreated Stage I patients with no evidence of disease (ned) was significantly higher than in healthy controls. NK activity was shown to decline in individuals with cytotoxic drug therapy (P equals 0.036). There also were reduction in lymphocyte recoveries concomitant with chemotherapeutic intervention (P less than 0.001). Lymphocyte counts were incorporated in a calculation of absolute NK activity that more accurately reflected the significant reduction in NK activity that occurred in patients with localized and systemic disease on chemotherapy. Different chemotherapeutic agents were found to selectively affect NK activity. Stage II patients on phenylalanine mustard (P)/5-fluorouracil (F) (PF) and cyclophosphamide (C)/methotrexate (M)/5-fluorouracil (F) (CMF) protocols showed significant reductions in overall NK activity relative to healthy controls and Stage I patients with ned. Patients on P/doxorubicin (A)/F/tamoxifen (Tx) (PAFT) protocols showed reduced NK activity relative to Stage I patients. Patients on the short-dose C/A (CA) protocol showed normal levels of overall NK activity. High-risk Stage I patients on methotrexate (M)/F (MF)with sequential leucovorin rescue and patients with metastatic disease on endocrine therapy, i.e., Tx or megestrol acetate (Meg) showed overall NK activities in the range of healthy controls. Patients with systemic disease on CMF, CMF/vincristine/prednisone (CMFVP), vinblastine/A/thiotepa/fluoxymesterone (VATH), mitomycin/mitoxantrone (MtMx), and A regimens showed overall levels of absolute NK that were significantly less than either healthy controls or metastatic patients undergoing endocrine therapy. NK cytolytic data, monitored at multiple effector to target ratios, were subjected to exponential regression analysis. The elevation of NK cell responses in Stage I patients with ned and the decline of NK cell responses with cytotoxic chemotherapy were due to alterations in the maximal plateau levels of NK cell cytotoxicity represented by the A (asymptote) values. The k values obtained on regression analysis and indices of the relative killing capacities of individual NK cells remained unaltered in all populations. These results suggest that the cytolytic lymphocyte NK pool, elevated in Stage I patients with cancer, selectively declines as a result of cytotoxic therapy. \nThe atrial natriuretic factor hormonal system in the regulation of sodium excretion in dogs with experimental heart failure. In response to a meat meal containing 125 mEq of sodium, conscious dogs (n = 5) with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and chronic compensated heart failure exhibited temporally related increases in postprandial plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (iANF), right atrial pressure, and sodium excretion. In separate experiments, two weeks of dietary sodium restriction produced similar marked stimulation of renin and aldosterone both in normal dogs (n = 5), and in AV fistula dogs (n = 5) with chronic high circulating levels of ANF. Plasma iANF did not change (P greater than .05) in either group. These results suggest that the ANF system is involved in the postprandial regulation of sodium excretion in the AV fistula dogs with compensated heart failure. In the postabsorptive state, however, the activity of the renin-aldosterone axis is closely related to dietary sodium intake and appears to function independently of the ANF system for the prevention of sodium loss. \nMalignant blue nevus. To elucidate the histologic features and biologic behavior of malignant blue nevus (MBN), 12 cases were analyzed in which the tumor showed no junctional activity and arose in a blue nevus background. Seven patients were men and five were women; their mean age was 48.8 years. Eight lesions were on the scalp, and no patient had a family history of melanoma. The histologic appearance of most lesions was a nodule or nodules of malignant cells in a blue nevus. Mitoses were present in all lesions with atypical forms in eight; however the mitotic rate exceeded two per ten high-power fields in only one lesion. Four lesions had necrosis, and four had a heavily pigmented malignant component. Four patients had recurrences; ten patients had metastases, and eight died of their disease. Therefore MBN is an aggressive neoplasm. \nPheochromocytoma with pyrexia and marked inflammatory signs: a paraneoplastic syndrome with possible relation to interleukin-6 production. Pheochromocytoma can cause several paraneoplastic syndromes. We report a patient with pheochromocytoma who exhibited pyrexia and marked inflammatory signs along with an elevated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level. All of these abnormalities disappeared and serum IL-6 became undetectable by removal of the tumor. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of IL-6 in the tumor cells. It is suggested that pyrexia and the elevation of acute phase proteins can be a paraneoplastic syndrome with pheochromocytoma, and that the elaboration of IL-6 from pheochromocytoma may play an important role in the development of the syndrome. \nSteps towards cost-benefit analysis of regional neurosurgical care OBJECTIVE--To determine the cost of averting death or severe disability by neurosurgical intervention. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of one year's admissions for neurosurgery; comparison of outcome with expected outcome in the absence of neurosurgical intervention and with the cost of neurosurgery. SETTING--Wessex Neurological Centre. PATIENTS--1026 Patients were admitted to the neurosurgical service in 1984. Of 1185 admissions, 978 case records were available and outcome was known in 919. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow outcome scale, modified as necessary, from the case notes, or by letter follow up to the general practitioner. Expected outcomes for each of the 54 diagnoses were derived from both published reports where available and an expert panel of 18 consultant neurosurgeons. The cost of the neurosurgical service for 1983-4 was known from a separate study and the cost per patient was calculated using the length of stay. RESULTS--The cost of neurosurgery in 1983-4 was 1.8 million pounds. In all, 243 deaths or severe disabilities were estimated to have been averted at an average cost of 7325 pounds (range 5000 pounds to 70,000 pounds). The overall cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was 350 pounds (range 34 pounds to greater than 400,000 pounds). The cost of long term care for severely disabled survivors is at least 18-fold greater than the cost of neurosurgical intervention to avert such disability. CONCLUSIONS--In Britain neurosurgery is not expensive in comparison with the costs and benefits of other areas of medicine, and the cost per QALY is unexpectedly low except for severe diffuse head injury, malignant brain tumors, and cerebral metastases. The neurosurgical budget should be assessed in the context of managing a patient in hospital and subsequently in the community. \nHLA class I antigen expression as a measure of response to antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B. HLA class I antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells was evaluated by flow cytometry in 21 HBeAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B. Measurements were made before, during or after treatment with recombinant interferon-alpha-2b, either given alone or after a 6 wk course of prednisone. Immunohistochemical staining for human leukocyte class I antigen was also evaluated in 28 percutaneous liver biopsy specimens either obtained before or after therapy (N = 27) and during therapy in one instance. The amount of HLA class I antigen on peripheral blood mononuclear cells varied markedly among individual patients, but the overall results indicated that the level of inducible antigen did not correlate with increments of ALT during therapy or with a virological response to therapy. Hepatocyte staining for HLA class I antigen was observed in a minority of biopsy specimens (29%) and also did not appear to predict a response or correlate with the severity of histological disease. These data do not support current theories concerning pathogenetic mechanisms in chronic hepatitis B nor do they suggest that spontaneous display of HLA class I antigen on hepatocytes or interferon-induced expression of these antigens on peripheral blood mononuclear cells is a critical determinant for a response to therapy. \nMalaria in an urban emergency department: epidemiology and diagnostic features of 25 cases. This article presents a retrospective study of 25 patients diagnosed with malaria in an urban emergency department (ED) between June 1986 and June 1989. The mean annual case rate of malaria in this study group was more than three times the national rate. This may be ascribed to the notable ethnic diversity of the population. A history of travel to an area endemic for malaria was eventually elicited from all patients. The most common chief complaint was fever (56%) followed by abdominal pain (12%). Temperatures were elevated in 70% of the patients, with a mean temperature of 102.9 degrees F (39 degrees C). Gender was found to play a role in delaying diagnosis, with women accounting for 83% of a group of patients requiring multiple ED visits before diagnosis. The authors conclude that malaria must be considered when diagnosing patients in ethnically diverse populations. Gender may be associated with a delay in diagnosis. A careful travel history and a peripheral smear are aids in rapid diagnosis. \nHepatic interferon-alpha gene transcripts and products in liver specimens from acute and chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In this study we have examined the localization of interferon-alpha in liver tissue from acute and chronic hepatitis B virus carriers to establish whether the defect in interferon-alpha production reported in chronic hepatitis B virus infection is at a pretranscriptional or posttranscriptional level using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques. Interferon-alpha messenger RNA transcripts and the immunoreactive protein were abundant in liver tissue and in particular in hepatocytes from patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection who subsequently recovered. In contrast interferon-alpha polypeptide was present in a significantly lower number of sinusoidal cells, mononuclear cells and hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers. Although a high proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection had cells that expressed interferon-alpha messenger RNA transcripts, the number of such cells was significantly less than in acute hepatitis B virus infection, indicating that the defect in the hepatic interferon-alpha synthesis is at the level of gene activation. Furthermore, using double immunohistochemical staining, the number of hepatocytes containing HBcAg correlated inversely with the proportion of neighboring sinusoidal cells expressing interferon-alpha. These data support previous observations that interferon-alpha production is reduced in chronic hepatitis B virus infection and are consistent with the view that this cytokine is important in the clearance of the virus. \nDeath by embolization of prosthetic aortic valve. This report describes a case in which a young woman died from embolization of her prosthetic aortic valve. The discussion includes the embolization's association with chronic intravenous narcotism, recurrent bacterial endocarditis, and acute cocaine toxicity. \nFlunarizine in migraine: a minireview. Flunarizine is a non-selective calcium antagonist. It distributes preferentially in the adipose tissue and passes the blood brain barrier. Numerous controlled clinical studies have established that flunarizine is efficacious in migraine prophylaxis, including double-blind studies in which the drug was compared with placebo or other antimigraine drugs. To avoid side effects a special schedule or administration is necessary. Flunarizine has no myogenic effect on smooth muscle cells of the vessles. It is said to be the only calcium antagonist able to protect brain cells against hypoxic damage. In addition, the considerable body of information which shows flunarizine capable of directly influencing the central nervous system, suggests that the drug's anti-migraine action may depend on its ability to influence central phenomena. \nA single-blind comparison of intravenous ondansetron, a selective serotonin antagonist, with intravenous metoclopramide in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy Ondansetron (GR 38032F), a selective antagonist of serotonin subtype 3 receptors, is effective in the prevention of emesis associated with cisplatin as well as other chemotherapeutic agents. In this randomized, single-blind, multicenter, parallel group study, we compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) ondansetron with IV metoclopramide in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 100 mg/m2) cisplatin chemotherapy. Three hundred seven patients receiving their first dose of cisplatin, either alone or in combination with other antineoplastic agents, were randomized to receive ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg IV every 4 hours for three doses or metoclopramide 2 mg/kg IV every 2 hours for three doses, then every 3 hours for three additional doses. The study prohibited the concurrent administration of other antiemetics or dexamethasone. Patients receiving ondansetron had a higher rate of complete protection from emesis (40% v 30%, P = .07), a higher complete plus major response rate (65% v 51%, P = .016), a lower rate of failure (21% v 36%, P = .007), and a lower median number of emetic episodes (one v two, P = .005) than did those receiving metoclopramide. The median time to the first emetic episode was longer on ondansetron (20.5 v 4.3 hours, P less than .001). Adverse events occurred in 48% of patients receiving ondansetron and 69% of those receiving metoclopramide (P less than .001). Akathisia and acute dystonic reactions occurred only on metoclopramide; headache (controlled with acetaminophen) was significantly more frequent with ondansetron. Ondansetron is more effective, produces fewer adverse events, and is easier to administer than metoclopramide for the prevention of emesis associated with high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy. \nThrombosis and thrombolysis in unstable angina. Pathophysiology of unstable angina involves spasm, plaque rupture, activation of platelets, and coagulation. The incidence and frequency of intracoronary thrombus formation are presently under active assessment in",
