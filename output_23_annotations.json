        "text": " 18 patients, vague abdominal tenderness in 11, and septic shock requiring vasopressors in 15. Sonographically, all patients had distended, spherical gallbladders, six had gallstones, eight had wall thickening, three had pericholecystic fluid, and four had Murphy's sign. All patients were seen by a senior abdominal surgeon, who agreed to a trial of percutaneous cholecystostomy. Fourteen patients (58%) responded to percutaneous cholecystostomy, as evidenced by a decrease in WBC count, defervescence, and the ability to be weaned off vasopressors. Bile cultures were positive in four patients. Ten patients (42%) did not respond to percutaneous cholecystostomy; five eventually died of unrelated causes. A respiratory source of infection was eventually found in three of these 10 patients, with no proved source of infection in the remainder. No complications related to catheter insertion occurred in this group of patients. Bile leaks occurred in two patients when the percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter was removed, but without serious consequence. Our experience suggests that a lower threshold for performing percutaneous cholecystostomy in this difficult clinical subset of patients is worthwhile. \nImpaired formation of the ternary insulin-like growth factor-binding protein complex in patients with hypoglycemia due to nonislet cell tumors. In some subjects with hypoglycemia associated with tumors of mesenchymal origin, high insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) levels have been described in serum and in the tumors. Tumor IGF-II of 10-15 kDa circulates in a 60-kDa complex, in contrast to the ternary 150-kDa complex in which serum IGFs normally circulate together with the IGF-binding subunit (IGFBP-3) and the acid-labile subunit (alpha-subunit). This study examines the molecular distribution and complex-forming activity of the components of the ternary complex in the serum of subjects with mesenchymal tumor hypoglycemia. Total serum IGFBP-3 levels were 60% of normal in tumor patients and appeared at 60 kDa on gel chromatography, shifting after tumor removal to 150 kDa. Total alpha-subunit levels were 40% of normal in patients with tumors, increasing after tumor removal to 70% of normal and changing in elution profile from a peak typical of uncomplexed alpha-subunit to the normal broad peak representing both complexed and uncomplexed alpha-subunit. Although low by RIA, alpha-subunit activity in a ternary complex formation assay was normal, indicating that the ability of free alpha-subunit in the patients' circulation to combine with exogenous IGFBP-3 plus IGF-I was not impaired. In contrast, in an assay that tested the ability of IGF-IGFBP complexes in the patients' circulation to combine with pure alpha-subunit, complex formation activity was 75-85% below normal in preoperative sera, despite low normal IGFBP-3 levels. Therefore, the cause of hypoglycemia in these patients may be the inability of complexes between the abnormal tumor IGF-II and IGFBP-3 to be sequestered in the biologically inactive ternary complex. \nThe significance of portal vein thrombosis after distal splenorenal shunt. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of portal vein thrombosis after the distal splenorenal shunt, to identify any predictive factors, and to assess the clinical significance of this complication. Preoperative and postoperative angiograms and clinical evaluation were reviewed in 124 patients who underwent distal splenorenal shunts. Total and partial portal vein thrombosis were seen on 13 (10.5%) and 22 (17.7%) postoperative angiograms, respectively. The only preoperative variable correlating with development of portal vein thrombosis was portal venous perfusion, which was significantly lower in patients with than in those without portal vein thrombosis. In six of 10 patients with postoperative pancreatitis, portal vein thrombosis developed. The frequency of early postoperative complications was significantly greater in patients with total portal vein thrombosis than in those with partial or no thrombosis. Long-term follow-up has shown no significant effects of portal vein thrombosis on late ascites, encephalopathy, or survival. \nIatrogenic epidermoid cyst of the parotid region following ear surgery. Iatrogenic implantation of squamous epithelium may result in formation of an epidermoid cyst. These cysts have been described in various sites around the head and neck following otological procedures. A case of iatrogenic epidermal cyst in the parotid region following repeated myringoplasty is reported. The clinical features and differential diagnosis are discussed. \nFatal and other major complications of endoscopic sinus surgery. Endoscopic sinus surgery has become an acceptable technique for the treatment of chronic sinus disease. This report analyzes five complications which came to my attention. Two cases were orbital:1 bilateral blindness due to damage of the optic nerves, and 1 damage of medial rectus muscle. The other 3 cases were intracranial:two cribriform plate damage with frontal lobe injury and hematoma, and 1 damage of the anterior cerebral artery, resulting in death. This rather novel technique, especially when used by less-experienced surgeons, has major complications similar to what has been reported with the traditional intranasal sphenoethmoidectomy. Knowledge of anatomy, good training, and meticulous surgical technique are very important. Endoscopic sinus surgery in patients with extensive pathology should be used with caution, especially if general anesthesia is selected or if excessive bleeding occurs. It would be beneficial to otolaryngologists to have previous experience in the traditional technique before adopting endoscopic sinus surgery to their armamentarium. Even then, major complications may occur in the hands of very experienced surgeons. Early recognition and proper management of these complications are of utmost importance in order to minimize disability or prevent death. \nBrachial plexus anesthesia for outpatient surgical procedures on an upper extremity We retrospectively reviewed 543 brachial plexus blocks performed on 526 outpatients. Most (98%) of the blocks were performed by means of the axillary approach. Various techniques were used, including paresthesia, transarterial fixation, nerve stimulation, or a combination of techniques; a high success rate was achieved with each of them. Only 7% of the blocks were incomplete and thus necessitated either general anesthesia or block supplementation with thiopental sodium and nitrous oxide. No persistent neurologic deficit was ascribed to the anesthetic technique. This review indicates that brachial plexus block, especially with use of the axillary approach, is a safe and effective option for outpatient surgical procedures on an upper extremity. \nValproate-induced coma with ketosis and carnitine insufficiency. We observed two patients who developed coma following administration of valproate in dosages of 32 to 40 mg/kg per day. Valproate levels were within the therapeutic range, and results of liver function studies were normal. Both patients had ketosis and adipic aciduria. Plasma free carnitine levels were decreased during coma and after recovery. One patient excreted ethylmalonic acid, butyrylcarnitine, and glutarylcarnitine during and after resolution of coma, suggesting a multiple acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenation defect. Low serum carnitine levels may predispose patients to development of altered consciousness when treated with valproate. \nFlecainide acetate treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: dose-response studies. The Flecainide Supraventricular Tachycardia Study Group. The dose-response relations for efficacy and tolerance of the antiarrhythmic drug flecainide acetate were studied in 28 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (Group 1) and 45 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter (Group 2). Recurrent symptomatic tachycardia was documented with use of transtelephonic electrocardiographic recording. Patients received flecainide in doses of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg twice daily and placebo for 1 month treatment periods. Among 14 patients in Group 1 who qualified for efficacy analysis, 4 (29%) had no tachycardia while taking placebo. The number with no tachycardia increased with progressively larger flecainide doses; with the 150 mg twice daily dose, 12 (86%) of 14 patients had no tachycardia (p less than 0.01 for overall differences among all treatments). Among 28 patients in Group 2, 2 (7%) had no tachycardia while taking placebo. The number with no tachycardia also increased with progressively larger flecainide doses; with the 150 mg twice daily dose, 17 (61%) of 28 patients had no tachycardia (p less than 0.01 for overall differences among all treatments). Noncardiac adverse experiences were the leading cause of premature study discontinuation during flecainide treatment periods (five patients in Group 1 and six patients in Group 2). \nEffects of H1-antihistamine drug regimen on histamine release by nonlesional skin mast cells of patients with chronic urticaria. Profiles of compound 48/80-induced histamine release (HR) from mast cells of uninvolved skin from patients with chronic urticaria (CU) and from a normal control (NC) group were compared, and the effects of anti-H1 medications were assessed versus placebo. Then, patients with CU (15) and NC subjects (10) were randomly assigned to take either hydroxyzine (100 mg/day), terfenadine (120 mg/day), or placebo for 28 days. The effects of such treatment on the clinical response and on the profile of compound 48/80-induced HR during a 4-hour period were analyzed. Treatment with hydroxyzine in patients with CU improved the clinical symptoms and modified the profile of HR; more histamine was recovered at 1 hour (p less than 0.05) and 2 hours (p less than 0.05), as compared with baseline. Terfenadine and placebo had no effect on the clinical response or on the profiles of HR. In the NC group, the amounts of histamine recovered at 1 hour after challenge with compound 48/80 were lower than amounts of the pretherapy values (p less than 0.01). It could be concluded that (1) the profile of HR in patients with CU is reproducible during a period of 28 days, (2) only hydroxyzine modifies both the clinical response and the profile of HR, and (3) anti-H1 compounds decrease the HR in the NC group. \nLysis of intraventricular hematoma with tissue plasminogen activator. Case report. A 42-year-old woman suffered a severe intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage from a ruptured anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. Evacuation of the frontal hematoma and clipping of the aneurysm was performed but the intraventricular blood clot persisted, causing ventricular dilatation and high intracranial pressure (ICP) 24 hours after surgery despite external ventricular drainage. Over this period of time the patient's clinical condition improved from Grade V to Grade IVb (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons classification). The intraventricular hematoma was lysed with a total of 8 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator injected directly into the ventricles on the 1st and 2nd postoperative days, resulting in rapid normalization of ventricular size and ICP. The patient has since made a substantial recovery and has been able to return home. \nNeurophysiological observations on the effects of botulinum toxin treatment in patients with dystonic blepharospasm. Botulinum toxin treatment improves dystonic blepharospasm by inducing transient paresis of the orbicularis oculi muscle. It is not known if it also reduces the enhanced brainstem neuronal excitability found in this disorder. We have performed conventional electromyography (EMG) and blink reflex excitability studies on fifteen patients with blepharospasm before and after botulinum toxin treatment. Denervation signs were found with needle EMG in all treated muscles. Amplitude of the facial compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and R1 response was reduced after botulinum toxin injections. In blink reflex excitability studies, the recovery of R2 response was enhanced after treatment even when patients were tested at the time of maximal benefit from botulinum toxin injections. The results suggest that there is little influence of botulinum toxin treatment upon the enhanced excitability of brainstem interneurons in patients with blepharospasm. \nQuadrilateral space syndrome: diagnosis and operative decompression technique. We present a series of five patients with quadrilateral space syndrome. All patients had the diagnosis made on the basis of (1) tenderness over the quadrilateral space, (2) paresthesia over the lateral shoulder and upper posterior arm, and (3) deltoid weakness associated with decreased shoulder abduction. A history of trauma was present in each patient. The operative technique described utilizes a cosmetically acceptable incision and is without the need to divide the deltoid from its origin on the scapular spine. The technique minimizes postoperative bleeding and facilities rehabilitation. Arteriography of the posterior circumflex humeral artery was not found necessary to make the diagnosis of axillary nerve entrapment in the quadrilateral space. \nComparative efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral administration of a TRH analogue (RX77368) in motor neuron disease. Ten consecutive patients with motor neuron disease (MND) who had bulbar symptoms received one or two intravenous doses followed by increasing oral doses of a TRH analogue (RX77368). Similar improvements in speech, swallowing and in tongue and jaw movements were seen after iv and oral administration in nine, five and eight patients respectively. The initial time course of improvement correlated with increasing plasma levels of the drug, but most clinical effects persisted when the levels decreased and became undetectable after 24 hours. The oral solution was tasteless and had no, or minimal, side effects. \nChagas' cardioneuropathy: effect of ganglioside treatment in chronic dysautonomic patients--a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. To date, there is no effective pharmacologic treatment for Chagas' cardioneuropathy, one of the most common causes of congestive heart failure and sudden death in the world. Fifty-eight adults with positive serology for Chagas' disease and abnormal autonomic nervous system tests participated in this placebo-controlled clinical trial with Cronassial (mixed gangliosides), 40 mg daily intramuscular injection for 4 or 8 weeks. We measured postural response (heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure changes in response to standing); heart rate changes induced by cough and hyperventilation reflex tests; dizziness on standing; number of stress-induced arrhythmias; and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive T-lymphocyte percentage in blood samples. Cronassial is safe and significantly improves systolic blood pressure (p = 0.050) and double product responses to postural stress (p = 0.028), hyperventilation heart rate response (p = 0.007), frequency of dizziness episodes (p less than 0.001), number of arrhythmias (p = 0.033), and percentage of PAS-positive T-lymphocyte counts (p less than 0.001) compared with placebo. \nMidline craniectomy for sagittal suture synostosis: comparative efficacy of two barriers to calvarial reclosure. This report quantitatively compares long-term head remolding achieved by two methods for retarding bone reunion after midline craniectomy for sagittal suture synostosis. In one group of six children the adjacent bone edges were overlayed with 1.0-cm-wide U-channel silicone strips, and in the other group, composed of seven patients, a considerably larger extent of the adjacent cranium was covered with silicone sheets. Mean percent change in the cephalic indices of the former group 18 months postoperatively was 9.1% +/- S.D. = 6.7, and of the latter group 23.7% +/- S.D. = 6.0 (p congruent to 0.01). These results indicate that the use of large silicone sheets lead to a significantly greater normalization of cranial proportions. \nHiccups (singultus): review and approach to management. Hiccups are a common, and fortunately usually transient, benign malady. Occasionally, however, hiccups fail to resolve spontaneously, resulting in patient fatigue and incapacitation and the need for the affected individual to seek medical care for resolution of the problem. The approach to the management of these patients consists of the identification and treatment of serious underlying causes of the episode as well as therapeutic interventions to achieve hiccup resolution. \nThe localization and distribution of corticotropin-releasing hormone in the human placenta and fetal membranes throughout gestation. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we have determined the localization and distribution of CRH immunoreactivity (CRH-IR) in the human placenta, fetal membranes, decidua, and umbilical cord. Tissues were obtained at 6-8 weeks of pregnancy, at term, in association with premature birth, and from patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension or diabetes mellitus. A polyclonal antibody to the epithelial cell marker cytokeratin was used to identify trophoblast cells. CRH-IR was not detected in placenta or decidua at 6-8 weeks gestation. In tissues obtained after idiopathic premature delivery after 21 weeks gestation, positive CRH staining was found in placenta in syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast, but not cytotrophoblast. CRH-IR was present in intermediate trophoblast cells that had invaded maternal blood vessels in decidua basalis. In the fetal membranes, CRH-IR was localized in the epithelium and subepithelial cells of amnion, in the trophoblast layer, in some cells of the reticular and cellular layers of chorion, and in some stromal cells and invasive trophoblast cells of decidua. CRH-IR was found in the amniotic epithelium of the umbilical cord and in the musculature of the umbilical vessels. This pattern of distribution of CRH-IR was found in tissues from 21 weeks gestation to term and postterm, and was similar in tissues examined from patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension and diabetes mellitus. These results show clearly that in placenta and membranes, CRH is localized primarily to syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast, but not to cytotrophoblast cells. We suggest that the localization of CRH-IR is consistent with CRH affecting paracrine/autocrine interactions within the placenta, fetal membranes, and decidua that may be involved in the maturation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and in the stimulus and maintainance of labor. \nThe relationship among canine brain temperature, metabolism, and function during hypothermia. Cerebral protection by hypothermia is commonly attributed to cerebral metabolic suppression. However, at temperatures below 28 degrees C, the relationship of temperature to cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) has not been well characterized. Accordingly, the relationship between brain temperature and CMRO2 was determined in eight dogs during cooling from 37 to 14 degrees C while the EEG was continuously monitored. Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated and control measurements were made at 37 degrees C during anesthesia with nitrous oxide 50-60% inspired and morphine sulfate 2 mg.kg-1 intravenously (iv). Upon cooling to 27 degrees C, the nitrous oxide was discontinued and the morphine was antagonized with naloxone 2 mg iv. Measurements were repeated at 27, 22, 18, and 14 degrees C and in four dogs again at 37 degrees C after nitrous oxide 50-60% had been reestablished at 27 degrees C along with administration of morphine sulfate 2 mg.kg-1. For each temperature interval, the temperature coefficient (Q10) for CMRO2 was calculated (Q10 = CMRO2 at x degrees C divided by CMRO2 at [x - 10] degrees C). Between 37 and 27 degrees C the Q10 was 2.23, but between 27 and 14 degrees C the mean Q10 was doubled to 4.53. With rewarming to 37 degrees C, CBF and CMRO2 returned to control levels, and brain biopsies revealed a normal brain energy state. During cooling, the EEG developed burst suppression at or below 22 degrees C. With further cooling, the periods of suppression increased; however, burst activity continued in seven of eight dogs even at 14 degrees C. \nPrognostic factors for local recurrence in the conservatively treated breast cancer patient: a cautious interpretation of the data. Between 1962 and 1984, a total of 433 patients were treated at Yale-New Haven Hospital with conservative surgery and radiation therapy (CS + RT) to the intact breast. As of January 1990, with a minimum assessable follow-up of 5 years and a median follow-up of 8.21 years, there have been a total of 50 breast recurrences resulting in a 5-year actuarial breast recurrence rate of 8%. Of all clinical factors tested, young age was the most significant prognostic factor for local recurrence (P less than .03). In addition, patients with pathologically involved lymph nodes were noted to have a lower local recurrence rate than patients with pathologically negative axillae (P less than .05). These findings were especially notable given the fact that the node-positive group had a higher percentage of T2 tumors and a higher percentage of patients in the young age group. These paradoxical findings, however, may be explained by the fact that 88% of the node-positive patients underwent adjuvant systemic therapy in the form of either systemic chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, while only 8% of node-negative patients underwent any adjuvant systemic therapy. When analyzed as a function of adjuvant therapy, those patients receiving adjuvant therapy had a lower local recurrence rate than those patients not receiving adjuvant therapy (P less than .08). We conclude that adjuvant systemic therapy impacts on the ipsilateral breast recurrence rate in patients treated with CS + RT. The implications of this study in light of the widespread use of adjuvant systemic therapy are discussed. \nPathophysiology of sciatica. The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms behind sciatica are incompletely known; however, compression of spinal nerve roots is known to be correlated to both pain and neural dysfunction in a segmental distribution of that specific nerve root. Compression per se may impair the transport of nutrients to the nerve tissue in such a way that affects the nerve root function. There also might be a local affect on nerve roots or root sleeves by substances leaking from the degenerated intervertebral discs. \nSurgical management of extracranial vertebral artery occlusive disease. Thirty-seven consecutive patients underwent vertebral artery (VA) reconstruction over a 6 years period (1983-1989). Detailed neurologic, medical, and angiographic information was obtained for all patients. Indications for surgery were as follows: (1) stenosis of VA with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency; (2) very tight stenosis (greater than 75%) of the dominant VA with stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral VA; (3) very tight stenosis of VA with bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA); (4) very tight stenosis of VA with homolateral ICA lesion eligible for simultaneous repair; (5) very tight stenosis of VA and very tight stenosis of the homo or contralateral carotid siphon. There were 15 isolated vertebral lesions (group I), and 22 were VA lesions associated with lesions of the supraaortic trunks which were simultaneously treated (group II). The reconstructions of the first portion of the VA were 30 (12 of group I and 18 of group II) and reimplantation of the VA into the common carotid artery was the procedure of choice. There were 7 revascularizations of the third portion of the VA at C1-C2 level (3 of group I and 4 of group II): carotid-vertebral bypass, using an autogenous vein graft, was the procedure of choice. Three patients in group II died in the immediate postoperative period from myocardial infarction but no patient presented immediate postoperative neurologic deficits. All symptomatic patients but one were relieved of their symptoms in a median follow-up of 31 months. No postoperative complications were observed. Long-term results were satisfactory in all the 28 patients at their last follow-up visit. \nTransesophageal color Doppler echocardiography of the normal St. Jude Medical mitral valve prosthesis. Transesophageal color flow Doppler findings are reported in 36 patients with a St. Jude Medical mechanical mitral valve prosthesis who had no auscultatory evidence for prosthetic valve dysfunction. Multiple jets consistent with mitral regurgitation originating from the central and lateral portion of the prosthesis were found in all patients. Maximum jet length ranged from 11 to 51 mm (mean 21 +/- 9 mm). Maximum jet area ranged from 0.2 to 4.1 cm3 (mean 1.2 +/- 0.9 cm2). The color M-mode Doppler interrogation showed two distinct components of the regurgitant jet: brief early systolic flow consistent with valve closure followed by holosystolic regurgitant flow consistent with transvalvular leakage. Four patients (11%) had a maximum regurgitant jet length exceeding 30 mm and absence of early systolic closure regurgitant flow by M-mode color imaging, suggesting clinically silent paravalvular leakage. Two pin-sized paravalvular suture line defects were confirmed in one patient at cardiac transplantation. We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography is a highly sensitive method for detection of mitral regurgitation in the St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis. Clinically silent paravalvular leakage should be suspected if the maximum jet length exceeds 30 mm and color M-mode interrogation fails to demonstrate an early systolic closure regurgitant flow component. \nFactors in recent reductions in liver cirrhosis deaths. Since the mid-1970s, there have been substantial declines in liver cirrhosis deaths in many Western countries following a long period of increases. There is variability in the pattern of changes observed: in a sample of 29 countries between 1974 and 1982-83, seven countries showed a significant linear decline, three revealed a curvilinear pattern, increases were observed in six and the rest (13) showed no notable changes. Although reductions in per capita consumption of alcohol may be a contributing factor, these reductions do not seem to account for all of the decreases in cirrhosis deaths that have been observed. Among other factors that might contribute, changes or increases in treatment for alcohol abuse and AA membership have been most strongly linked to these declines; changes in patterns of consumption, dietary habits, prevention efforts and reduced exposure to predisposing factors may also be involved. In view of the importance of these declines for the understanding and prevention of alcohol problems, further research on this issue, perhaps involving international collaborative studies, is needed. \nUltrastructural study of glandular epithelium in adenomyosis in comparison with those of proliferative endometrium and well-differentiated endometrial cancer. Adenomyotic glandular tissue from five patients underwent electron microscopic investigation to observe its ultrastructural characteristics. The adenomyotic epithelium was compared with that of proliferative normal epithelium (two patients) and well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma (two patients). The results revealed that morphologically the adenomyotic glandular epithelium is somewhat less differentiated than proliferative endometrium and that its cytoplasmic organelles have some similarities with those of endometrial cancer. Whether these similarities predispose the adenomyotic glandular tissue to malignant degeneration remains to be elucidated. \nInitial clinical experience with a 48 by 48 element biplane transesophageal probe. Recent technologic advances in ultrasound have resulted in the capability of transesophageal echocardiographic imaging in both transverse and longitudinal planes. Previous biplane probes suffered from inferior images because of reduced scan elements. We evaluated the utility of a prototype 48 X 48 element biplane transesophageal probe in 23 consecutive patients. Examinations were well tolerated with no side effects. In comparison to the single transverse plane, imaging with the longitudinal plane gave superior information on prosthetic valve pathology, atrial septal abnormalities, and pathoanatomy of the ascending aorta and mitral valve. Complementary information was provided by the longitudinal plane in patients with endocarditis and vegetations and in mitral protheses. Images obtained with this 48 X 48 element biplane probe along with color and spectral Doppler information were not perceptibly inferior to those obtained by single-plane probes. In conclusion, biplane transesophageal echocardiography with a 48 X 48 element probe indicates a great potential for enhanced three-dimensional understanding of cardiac pathology and diagnostic yield in specific pathologies. \nKlippel-Trenaunay syndrome: the risks and benefits of vascular interventions. Our experience with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), a rare congenital malformation, has increased considerably in recent years and now includes 144 patients (65 male and 79 female patients). Hemangioma was present in 137 patients (95.1%), varicosity in 110 (76.4%), and hypertrophy of the soft tissues or bones in 134 (93.1%). In most patients (71.5%) the disease involved one lower extremity. Diagnostic workup included roentgenogram to document limb length discrepancy, noninvasive arterial and venous evaluation, contrast venography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Most patients did well without treatment or with elastic compression only. Surgical treatment for the vascular malformation in KTS is rarely needed and it continues to be controversial. To evaluate the risks and benefits of vascular interventions, we examined in detail the clinical histories of nine patients who in the last decade underwent operation for a vascular malformation of the lower extremity. In seven patients we removed varicose veins or resected hemangioma of the lower extremity. Although none was cured, all five who underwent resection of varicose veins and one of the two patients who underwent resection of a hemangioma improved. Two additional patients, however, who underwent resection of varicose veins in another institution had worsening of the symptoms. In one patient we performed deep venous reconstruction for atresia of the superficial femoral vein, using the contralateral saphenous vein. Such operation in KTS has not been reported previously. The patient has a patent graft with a competent valve and clinical improvement 6 months after the operation. Although patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency, disturbing cosmetic appearance, or complications of hemangioma may benefit from surgical treatment, detailed preoperative imaging of the extremity and pelvis with magnetic resonance imaging and contrast venography is needed to decrease complications. Rarely, reconstruction for atresia or hypoplasia of the deep veins may be needed. \nRole of platelet function in symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. To evaluate the role of platelet function in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm, we compared sequential changes of platelet aggregability and beta-thromboglobulin and thromboxane B2 concentrations in blood samples from the internal jugular and peripheral vein of 13 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Platelet function in blood from the internal jugular vein tended to be enhanced during days 0-1 but recovered to the normal range during days 2-4. After day 5, platelet function showed various patterns depending on the presence of symptomatic vasospasm. In patients without symptomatic vasospasm, sequential changes were relatively minor, with normal or slightly high values. Patients with symptomatic vasospasm already showed high platelet aggregability during the early stage of vasospasm. The concentration of beta-thromboglobulin increased several days after the onset of vasospasm, reaching 80 ng/ml or more in patients with a poor prognosis. Two of the five patients with symptomatic vasospasm showed markedly high concentrations of thromboxane B2 after day 8. These results suggest that vasospasm activates platelets and promotes aggregability and that the resulting increased tendency for thrombus formation may affect the patient's prognosis during the advanced stage. \nThe use of releasable sutures in Molteno glaucoma implant procedures to reduce postoperative hypotony. We used releasable sutures to minimize immediate postoperative hypotony and flat anterior chamber in 19 cases of refractory glaucoma requiring insertion of a single-plate Molteno implant in a one-stage procedure. A slip knot using 7-0 nylon suture was fashioned around the Molteno tube under a lamellar scleral flap. In 18 of the 19 eyes, anterior chamber depth was normal immediately after surgery. \nPrevention of vasospasm by clot removal and intrathecal bolus injection of tissue-type plasminogen activator: preliminary report. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of postoperative intrathecal injections of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in preventing cerebral vasospasm in cases with a diffuse severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. All 10 cases were graded Group 3 according to the classification of Fisher and associates, and the CT number (Hounsfield number) of the subarachnoid clot was over 75. After clipping the aneurysm and removing the clot, three cisternal drainage catheters were inserted into both sylvian cisterns and the prepontine cistern, and continuous ventricular drainage was performed routinely. Postoperatively, tPA (0.5 mg/2.5 ml) was infused as a bolus into both basal cisterns and the lateral ventricle twice daily for about 6 days. Angiography and cerebral blood flow studies using single photon emission computed tomography were performed on Day 4 or 5 and between Days 7 and 10 after onset of the hemorrhage. To date, there have been no cases that have shown angiographic vasospasm or delayed ischemic neurological deficits. This preliminary study indicates that the intrathecal bolus injection of tPA produces a marked effect on vasospasm. \nAssessment of current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging of vulvar carcinoma relative to prognostic factors for survival (a Gynecologic Oncology Group study). Analysis of 588 patients with vulvar carcinoma delineated four risk groups by the proportional hazards model. Groin node status (laterality and number positive) and lesion diameter were the only two important independent prognostic factors. The 5-year relative survival rates were 98%, 87%, 75%, and 29% for the risk group categories of minimal (negative groin nodes and lesion diameter less than or equal to 2 cm), low (one positive groin node and lesion diameter less than or equal to 2 cm or negative groin nodes and fewer than two lesions less than or equal to 8 cm diameter), intermediate (negative groin nodes and lesion diameter greater than 8 cm diameter, one positive groin node and lesion diameter greater than 2 cm, or two unilaterally positive groin nodes and lesion diameter less than or equal to 8 cm), and high (three or more positive groin nodes or two bilaterally positive groin nodes), respectively. Applying the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging (1988) to these data discriminated risk of death (caused by recurrent vulvar cancer); the 5-year rates were 98%, 85%, 74%, and 31% for stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. However, within International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III there were 47 low-, 95 intermediate-, and 28 high-risk patients with relative survivals of 95%, 74%, and 34%, respectively. Overall, this assessment validates current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics vulvar carcinoma staging, but further refinements are warranted in stage III. \nIctal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in alternating hemiplegia. 99mTc-hexamethylpropylenamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in a patient with alternating hemiplegia during 2 episodes of the disease. The regional cerebral blood flow patterns correlated with the clinical manifestations during both episodes. Hyperperfusion of the contralateral hemisphere was suggested by asymmetric 99mTc-HMPAO uptake, whereas symmetric 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine uptake was detected during the interictal period. The results suggested that alternating hemiplegia in infants represents an atypical manifestation of epilepsy, despite the lack of paroxysmal electroencephalographic abnormalities during the episodes. 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT appears to be a useful method for detecting transient regional cerebral blood flow alterations during paroxysmal events because the tracer is rapidly available for emergencies and retains a fixed distribution for 5-8 hours, sufficient time to allow for SPECT acquisition. \nNative valve Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis: report of seven cases and review of the literature. This report describes seven patients from three university hospitals whose native valve infective endocarditis was caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. The literature on endocarditis caused by S. epidermidis is also reviewed and the clinical features of patients with native valve endocarditis due to this organism are compared with those of patients from a general series of infective endocarditis cases. Compared with infective endocarditis caused by other organisms, S. epidermidis endocarditis tends to occur more frequently in male patients. Patients with S. epidermidis endocarditis exhibit fewer embolic complications and skin manifestations. The frequency of congestive heart failure is lower in this group. The relative indolent course and apparent rarity of native valve S. epidermidis endocarditis necessitate a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis. \nPreservation of skeletal muscle in tissue transfers using rat hindlimbs. Replantation of major extremities after long periods of ischemia can lead to viable replants in many cases, but functional restoration is often poor owing to fibrosis of the muscle. In this study, maximum hypothermic time in tissue transfers containing skeletal muscle using hindlimbs of Lewis rats preserved in 4 degrees C Euro-Collins solution was investigated. After preserving midthigh amputated legs in this solution for 6, 9, and 12 hours, the legs were transplanted to other inbred rats using microsurgical technique, and 1 week later, gastrocnemii were obtained to analyze ATP, ADP, and AMP using high-performance liquid chromatography. The values were compared with those for healthy legs, nonischemic operated control legs, and legs preserved in the same manner for 6, 9, and 12 hours. Histologic and serologic examinations were conducted. ATP values of the 9-hour preservation group resumed those of the nonischemic operated control group, with the values of the 12-hour preservation group remaining at 61 percent. Histologically, focal necrosis, hyaline degeneration, and regeneration processes were the most characteristic manifestations in the muscles transplanted after cold ischemia of 12 hours. It was concluded that skeletal muscle could be preserved for 9 hours in 4 degrees C Euro-Collins solution. \nSurgical evaluation of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Experience with 110 children. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a disorder of unknown origin that is probably related to an autoimmune phenomenon. This report concerns 110 children (mean age, 6.2 years; range, 6 months to 14 years) with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Seventy-two (65%) had abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, bloody stool, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Sixty patients with abdominal pain were evaluated and treated conservatively. However, 12 patients underwent laparotomy. Six underwent unnecessary appendectomy for wrongly diagnosed appendicitis. Bowel resection was performed in one patient for an obstructive ileal lesion. Six additional patients had intussusception; surgery was required in three, while barium enema reduction was successfully accomplished in three others. Massive gastric hemorrhage required ligation, vagotomy, and pyloroplasty in two instances. One child with severe scrotal pain, hemorrhage, and swelling underwent unnecessary scrotal exploration. Four additional patients with similar symptoms avoided operation after a testicular scintiscan demonstrated good blood flow. A high index of suspicion and early diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura based on clinical, roentgenographic, and laboratory findings may avoid unnecessary operations in most cases. However, life-threatening complications (hemorrhage, obstruction, and intussusception) may occur and require operative intervention. All of the patients survived. \nEffects of atrial natriuretic factor in chronic hypoxic spontaneously hypertensive rats. The present study was designed first to investigate the pulmonary hypertensive effects of chronic hypoxia in spontaneously hypertensive rats and second to compare the cardiovascular effects of atrial natriuretic factor on rats exposed to hypoxia and on control rats kept at sea level. Catheters were placed in the femoral and pulmonary arteries for measurement of mean systemic arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure. The cardiac output was measured by thermodilution method. It was found that 4 weeks of simulated 18,000-foot hypoxia led to polycythemia, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary hypertension, which resulted from an increased pulmonary vascular resistance. However, systemic arterial pressure was not significantly different between the two groups of rats. Atrial natriuretic factor administration decreased systemic arterial pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure to a lesser extent in the hypoxic group compared with the sea level control group. It is concluded that these animals showed an impaired response to atrial natriuretic factor after long-term exposure to hypoxia. \nDisappearance of thalamic pain after parietal subcortical stroke. A hypertensive man had a long standing history of contumacious hyperpathia in the right upper extremity, resistant to medical therapy, secondary to a lacunar infarct in the left thalamus. A second cerebrovascular accident caused a small lesion in the left corona radiata, interrupting the thalamoparietal interconnections, and terminated the pain instantly. Interruption of the subcortical parietal white matter may more effectively control pain than cortical lesions. A few surgeons have successfully treated rebellious chronic pain with stereotaxic operations in the corona radiata, resulting in lesions very similar to our patient's. This overlooked and nearly forgotten technique may still have value in treating selected cases. \nHepatitis C virus antibodies in subjects with and without liver disease in the United Kingdom. The prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus, evidence of previous or current infection with this agent of parenterally transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis, was determined in 340 subjects residing in the United Kingdom. The antibody was detected in 3 per cent of unselected blood donors and in 60 per cent of patients with chronic post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis. Evidence for infection was also found in 30 per cent of intravenous drug abusers, and in 75 per cent of haemophiliacs receiving commercial factor VIII concentrate. The infection is uncommon in renal units and amongst sexually promiscuous groups attending sexually-transmitted disease clinics. Although the seropositivity rate in primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic B and delta hepatitis was very low (0-2 per cent), in patients with autoimmune and alcoholic liver disease it was 14-16 per cent which, although lower than that quoted in studies from Spain and Italy, is considerably higher than would be expected by chance. The reason for the high incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in this latter group of patients is unclear. \nSevere hypertension with segmental renal infarction following surgical removal of a retroperitoneal malignant hemangiopericytoma: a case report. Severe hypertension developed in a fifty-five year-old woman after surgical removal of a retroperitoneal tumor, when the renal artery was injured. Renal arteriography after the surgery demonstrated a segmental infarction of the right kidney. A close relationship between activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the development of severe hypertension was observed. Satisfactory control of blood pressure concomitant with reduction of plasma renin activity was achieved by a combination of an angiotensin-converting anzyme inhibitor, beta-blocking agent, and calcium-entry blocker. The mechanism of activation of the renin-angiotensin system in renal infarction is discussed. \nAtrial natriuretic peptide in dialysis patients under various conditions of volume homeostasis. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were studied in 19 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under haemodialysis (HD). On the basis of clinical findings, patients were divided into three groups: group A, 6 patients, of mean age 41 +/- 15 years, without heart failure and in need of ultrafiltration (658 +/- 282 ml h-1); group B, 6 patients, of mean age 54 +/- 15 years, without heart failure under isovolaemic HD; group C, 7 patients, of mean age 60 +/- 3 years, with heart failure (NYHA III-IV) and in need of ultrafiltration (607 +/- 120 ml h-1). The highest predialysis ANP levels were found in group C (1534 +/- 471 pg ml-1) followed by group A (476 +/- 168 pg ml-1) and group B (236 +/- 138 pg ml-1) (normal range 62 +/- 27 pg ml-1). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate did not correlate with ANP levels in either of the groups. However, iso-osmotic reduction of the body weight by ultrafiltration was correlated with decreasing ANP levels during HD (for groups A and C, r = 0.88 and 0.98, respectively). Isovolaemic HD did not alter ANP concentrations (group B). All patients received a volume bolus at the end of HD, and they responded with an instant increase in ANP concentration, which was most pronounced in patients with concomitant heart failure. PRA was not significantly correlated with ANP levels during HD. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that there is a sensitive response of ANP levels to changes in body fluid status in ESRD. \nEffects of aspirin treatment on diabetic retinopathy. ETDRS report number 8. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group. Aspirin treatment did not alter the course of diabetic retinopathy in patients enrolled in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). In this randomized clinical trial supported by the National Eye Institute, 3711 patients with mild-to-severe nonproliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy were assigned randomly to either aspirin (650 mg per day) or placebo. Aspirin did not prevent the development of high-risk proliferative retinopathy and did not reduce the risk of visual loss, nor did it increase the risk of vitreous hemorrhage. This was true both for eyes assigned randomly to deferral of photocoagulation and for eyes assigned randomly to early argon laser photocoagulation. The ETDRS results indicate that for patients with mild-to-severe non-proliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy, it is likely that aspirin has no clinically important beneficial effects on the progression of retinopathy. The data also show that aspirin 650 mg per day had no clinically important harmful effects for diabetic patients with retinopathy. These findings suggest there are no ocular contraindications to aspirin when required for cardiovascular disease or other medical indications. \nMedical Research Council European trial of chorion villus sampling. MRC working party on the evaluation of chorion villus sampling. First-trimester chorion villus sampling has the advantage over second-trimester amniocentesis of allowing earlier prenatal diagnosis of various genetic and cytogenetic disorders in the fetus (and therefore earlier termination in affected pregnancies) but the relative safety and diagnostic accuracy remain unclear. Between 1985 and 1989, 3248 women seeking prenatal diagnosis, principally because of their age, were recruited to an international, multicentre, randomised comparison of the safety and diagnostic accuracy of the two techniques--5% of women allocated chorion villus sampling and 8% of those allocated amniocentesis were not tested, usually because of spontaneous miscarriage. 6% and 2% were retested, in most because of sampling failure. The endpoint of a liveborn infant who survived was achieved by 86% of women allocated chorion villus sampling and 91% of those allocated amniocentesis; statistical analysis, after appropriate weighting for a centre's contribution, showed that the typical difference between the groups was 4.6% (95% confidence interval 1.6-7.5%; p less than 0.01). This difference reflected more spontaneous fetal deaths before 28 weeks' gestation (2.9% [0.6-5.3%]); more terminations of pregnancy for chromosomal anomalies (1.0% [0.0-2.1%]); and more neonatal deaths (0.3% [-0.1 to 0.7%]). The difference in neonatal deaths was due to a preponderance of very immature liveborn infants in the chorion villus sampling group, and this factor also explained that group's longer mean stay in hospital. More abnormal diagnoses followed chorion villus than amniotic fluid analyses (5.6% vs 3.9%). This difference was largely due to diagnoses of trisomy 18 and of (usually mosaic) abnormalities known to be confined to the placenta. 3 terminated pregnancies were false positives, 1 tested by chorion villus sampling and 2 by amniocentesis, and 2 other mosaic cases diagnosed by chorion villus sampling may have been false positives. There was 1 false-negative result in the chorion villus sampling group. The possibility of earlier exclusion or diagnosis of some fetal disorders afforded by first-trimester chorion villus sampling must be set against its clinical risks. \nChildren with chronic illness: family and parent demographic characteristics and psychosocial adjustment. This paper presents the results of an epidemiologic study that compares and contrasts psychosocial characteristics of parents and family units of children with chronic illness or physical disability (chronic health problems) with those of healthy children. Data were derived from the Ontario Child Health Study of 1869 randomly selected families, with 3294 children aged 4 to 16 years. In the absence of significant differences between parents and families of children with chronic illness alone and those with physical disability, these groups were combined for analysis, for which odds ratios (OR) or t tests were used. Significant positive findings included increased rates of parental treatment for \"nerves\" (mothers' OR = 2.1, fathers' OR = 1.9) and increased maternal negative affect scores (Bradburn Affect Balance Scale) (P less than .001) among parents of children with chronic health problems. Important negative findings (95% confidence interval of the OR included 1) included no increase in single-parent families (OR = 1.2), social isolation (OR = 1.0), or alcohol problems (OR = 1.2) among parents of children with chronic health problems. Categorically defined family dysfunction did not differ between the two groups (OR = 1.1). These data contrast with several clinic-based studies and suggest that, in a widely generalizable population survey, families of children with chronic health problems including physical disability do not suffer a marked excess of dysfunction, although some indicators of individual parent psychosocial problems were modestly elevated. \nIn vivo molecular analysis of lymphokines involved in the murine immune response during Schistosoma mansoni infection. I. IL-4 mRNA, not IL-2 mRNA, is abundant in the granulomatous livers, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleens of infected mice. Using Northern Blot analysis, the endogenous levels of IL-4 and IL-2 mRNA in the spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes, and granulomatous livers of male CBA/J mice in the acute phase of infection with Schistosoma mansoni have been quantified. High levels of IL-4 mRNA were detected in all three tissues from infected mice, whereas none was detected in tissues from normal, uninfected, age-matched mice. Isolation of the granulomas from the livers of infected mice and subsequent extraction of total RNA from these lesions resulted in a 70-fold enrichment of IL-4 message compared with the whole, unseparated granulomatous liver tissue. Hence, the predominant source of the IL-4 mRNA detected in livers from infected mice appears to be the schistosome egg-induced granulomas within these livers. In contrast, IL-2 mRNA was never detected in any of these tissues from either infected or normal mice. Control experiments were performed that ruled out the possibility that this inability to detect IL-2 mRNA was due to a difference in the efficacy of the IL-4 and IL-2 probes or due to a selective lability of IL-2 message. These data imply that IL-4-producing, Th2 lymphocytes are active in and possibly integral to the granulomatous, delayed-type hypersensitivity response characteristic of this infection, and directly challenges the current hypothesis that delayed-type hypersensitivity responses are exclusively mediated by Th1 lymphocytes. \nCardiac disturbances during the administration of taxol. The clinical development of taxol, a new antimicrotubule agent with a unique mechanism of cytotoxic action, has proceeded slowly due to serious hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) and shortages in its supply. Nevertheless, large-scale phase II trials have been initiated as taxol has recently demonstrated impressive activity in advanced and cisplatin-refractory ovarian carcinoma. Furthermore, the incidence of HSRs has been reduced substantially with premedications and modifications in the administration schedule. However, various manifestations of potential cardiotoxicity have been observed in several patients who participated in four phase I and II studies of taxol. Asymptomatic bradycardia has occurred in a high proportion of patients, including 29% of ovarian cancer patients who were treated with maximally tolerated doses of taxol in a phase II study. More profound cardiac disturbances, including a range of atrioventricular conduction blocks, left bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and manifestations of cardiac ischemia, have been observed in seven of 140 patients (5%) who received taxol. Descriptions of these events are presented in this report to alert investigators to the potential for these adverse effects. Although these disturbances did not result in serious sequelae in most patients, investigators should continue to maintain a high degree of caution until precise risk factors, frequency, and clinical significance of these adverse cardiac effects are determined. \nMycotic (Aspergillus) arteritis resulting in fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a case report. A seventy-one year-old Japanese man suffering from carcinoma of the common bile duct died from subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary in intracranial mycotic arteritis (MA). Repeated cultures of the discharge from the draining tubes, the tip of intravenous hyperalimentation catheters, blood, sputum, and urine failed to grow any fungus. Autopsy disclosed MA due to Aspergillus at the terminal portion of the right internal carotid artery close to the posterior communicating artery. \nEvaluation of salvage surgery in heavily irradiated cancer of the buccal mucosa. This report describes the authors' experience with salvage surgery in 78 patients with carcinoma of the buccal mucosa who failed after high-dose radical radiation therapy at Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India. Forty-four patients (56%) required a hemimandibulectomy for adequate tumor clearance. Fifty-four patients (69%) required a primary reconstructive procedure for wound closure. Follow-up periods ranged from 28 months to 63 months (median follow-up, 41 months). Thirteen patients (17%) developed nonfatal postoperative complications. Thirty-one patients recurred after surgery, five of whom were again salvaged by further surgery. Overall, the recurrence rate was 36%. Most of the recurrences (26/31) were at the primary site. The overall 5-year actuarial disease-free survival after salvage surgery was 59.7%. T stage of the recurrent tumor and its skin infiltration emerged as factors which significantly influenced disease-free survival (P less than 0.05). \nIntra-arterial thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia. A group of 54 patients with acute or chronic limb ischaemia were initially treated with low dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy using streptokinase (10,000 units h-1) or plasminogen activator (0.5 mg h-1). Complete thrombolysis was obtained in 90 per cent of patients with symptoms of less than 1 week duration, and in 50 per cent with symptoms of greater than 1 week (P less than 0.05). Successful lysis in 36 patients was followed by successful bypass surgery in seven, percutaneous angioplasty in 13, no further treatment in 13, repeat thrombolysis in two and amputation in one. Failed therapy was associated with major amputation in 40 per cent. One patient died of haemorrhage and another of stroke as a direct result of thrombolytic treatment. The most common complication was haematoma at the site of cannulation of the vessel. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy can be very useful for the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia, but complications do occur and patients should be carefully selected. \nSingle operator cardiopulmonary resuscitation in ambulances. Which ventilation device? Cardiopulmonary resuscitation en route to hospital is performed by a single-handed operator in many British ambulances. In this study, three emergency ventilation devices, and mouth-to-mouth breathing, were compared for effectiveness in unintubated patients. Seventeen paramedics used each method on a Laerdal manikin in a randomised order, under identical conditions. Three experienced cardiopulmonary resuscitation instructors repeated the tests in a moving ambulance. There were significant differences in minute volume (p less than 0.01) and number of effective chest compressions (p less than 0.05); mouth-to-mouth breathing produced the best overall results and the simplest device was a close second. The value of automatic ventilators for single-operator cardiopulmonary resuscitation in unintubated patients is questioned. \nHTLV-1 associated T cell lymphoma in South East Asia: case report and family study. Geographic clustering of human T cell lymphoma/leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is well recognised, particularly in south western Japan, parts of West and Central Africa, the south eastern United States and the Caribbean islands. Sporadic cases have been reported in many other parts of the world. The first case of HTLV-1 associated leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in South East Asia is reported. Contact tracing showed a high incidence of carriers among the relatives. \nAn inherited defect of neutrophil motility and microfilamentous cytoskeleton associated with abnormalities in 47-Kd and 89-Kd proteins. A 2-month-old male Tongan infant presented with fever, severe skin and mucosal infections, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and normal neutrophil counts. While polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) morphology was normal, several neutrophil motile functions were found to be altered in the patient. Furthermore, two siblings had died in infancy with a similar clinical picture, raising the possibility of an inherited neutrophil defect. Random migration and chemotaxis, assessed by the under agarose method, were profoundly impaired. Actin polymerization, as measured by flow cytometry of N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)phallacidin (NBD-phallacidin)-stained PMNs, showed lower basal F-actin and a 1.75-fold increase in response to 10(-7) mol/L formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) compared with a 4.51-fold increase in control. Microscopic examination of NBD-phallacidin-stained PMN spread on glass showed decreased area of spreading and F-actin-rich filamentous projections distinct from control. The early phase of FMLP-induced right angle light scattering was absent, similar to the effect caused by cytochalasin-B (CB), an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Accordingly, FMLP induced secretion of elastase without the addition of CB. Staphylococcus aureus killing was 50% of control whereas superoxide production response to FMLP and surface expression of CD11b were greater than twice normal. Partial defects in actin polymerization and scatter were seen in the parents and release of elastase, in the absence of CB, was also increased in both parents. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis of whole cell proteins from the patient showed a marked decrease in an 89-Kd protein (8% of control) and a marked increase in a 47-Kd protein (4.2-fold). Both mother and father had decreased 89-Kd (77% and 42% of control) and increased 47-Kd proteins (2- and 3.4-fold), although neither had recurrent infections or chemotactic defects. These studies describe a new inherited actin dysfunction syndrome associated with severe propensity to fungal infection and draw attention to the proteins of apparent molecular weights of 89 Kd and 47 Kd, which may be of great importance in the regulation of actin polymerization in human PMNs. \nUsefulness of early versus late programmed ventricular stimulation in acute myocardial infarction. To determine the influence of timing on the prognostic value of programmed ventricular stimulation after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 32 patients were studied on day 19 (early study) and again on day 36 (late study) after AMI using up to 3 extrastimuli. At the early study, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) was induced in 12 patients (38%), sustained polymorphic VT in 8 (25%), nonsustained monomorphic VT in 1 (3%), nonsustained polymorphic VT in 1 (3%) and no inducible arrhythmia in 10 (31%). At the late study, sustained monomorphic VT, nonsustained monomorphic VT and nonsustained polymorphic VT were induced in 8 patients (25%) each, and no inducible arrhythmia in 8 (25%). Of the 12 patients who had inducible sustained monomorphic VT at the early study, 7 had noninducibility of sustained monomorphic VT at the late study. Of the 20 patients who had noninducibility of sustained monomorphic VT at the early study, 3 had inducible sustained monomorphic VT at the late study. During the follow-up period (mean +/- standard deviation 21 +/- 8 months), there were 2 sudden cardiac deaths and 3 occurrences of sustained VT. Univariate analysis revealed both inducibilities of sustained monomorphic VT at the early study (p = 0.045) and at the late study (p less than 0.001) to be predictive of sudden cardiac death or clinical occurrence of sustained VT. However, inducibility of sustained monomorphic VT at the late study had a higher sensitivity (100%), specificity (89%), positive predictive value (63%) and negative predictive value (100%) than at the early study (80, 70, 33 and 95%, respectively). \nAllochiria vs allesthesia. Is there a misperception? Allochiria is the mislocation of sensory stimuli to the corresponding opposite half of the body or space. Obersteiner (1882) introduced the term allochiria (Greek allos = other + chiria = hand), and more than 20 authors employed it in this context over the next 25 years. Stewart (1894) described a related phenomenon in which stimuli are displaced to a different point on the same extremity. He noted that the displacements were different than allochiria and coined the term allachaesthesia (ie, allesthesia) (Greek allache = elsewhere + aisthesis = perception). Despite this historical background, Jones (1907) redefined both terms in an attempt to increase diagnostic specificity and attributed allochiria to hysteria. Jones' reinterpretation does not appear to be justified historically, etymologically, or scientifically and has resulted in contradictory definitions of allochiria and allesthesia in present-day medical dictionaries and neurologic textbooks. We advocate a return to usage consistent with the original descriptions and word derivations. \nAutologous fat injection for vocal cord medialization in the canine larynx. This study examined the use of autologous fat as an alternative to Teflon and collagen as the implantable material in vocal cord medialization. Five animals underwent left recurrent laryngeal nerve sections with subsequent fat harvest and implantation into the left true vocal cords. Three animals were killed after 48 hours and 2 after 3 weeks; their larynges were examined with light microscopy. The results of the 48-hour samples show mode-rate acute inflammation and few areas of focal necrosis. The 3-week samples show no necrotic foci, minimal foreign-body reaction, and maintenance of structure and volume of the injected fat. Autologous fat may prove to be a valuable alternative to nonautologous injectable material in vocal cord augmentation. \nPerformance of age-matched controls on a battery of visuo-spatial neglect tests. Examination of 47 independent elderly subjects, matched with a population of patients with acute stroke, found that 55% made at least one omission on a battery of neglect tests. Up to 43% made omissions on any one test. Increasing age and other evidence of cognitive impairment were associated with impaired performance on the battery. Omissions were attributed to an age-related decline in visuo-spatial function. Cut-off points are provided to distinguish between such age-related impairment and visuospatial neglect. The importance of age-matched control studies in developing tests of cognitive impairment in stroke research is highlighted. \nHepatoid adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis producing alpha-fetoprotein of hepatic type and bile pigment. A right renal pelvic mass in a 72-year-old man was resected. The histologic appearance of the tumor was a mixture of tubular adenocarcinoma cells and hepatoid neoplastic cells, and there was a resemblance to hepatoid adenocarcinoma. The intraoperative level of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was calculated to be 2246 ng/ml, and the postoperative level ranges from 183.6 to 285.6 ng/ml. Lectin binding assays showed that the serum AFP was the hepatic carcinoma type. In a hepatoid portion, an iron-negative, brown to green pigment was positive for bile. Alpha-fetoprotein was immunohistochemically evident in the neoplastic cells. In addition to the hepatic differentiation, the tumor had differentiated into intestinal absorptive or pancreatobiliary tract cells, as deduced from the frequent presence of spicular bodies, a unique light microscopic feature equivalent to microvilli with an actin core. The hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a distinct type of AFP-producing carcinoma present in the organs with epithelium of endodermal origin. Hepatoid adenocarcinoma in the renal pelvis may arise from a metaplasia of neoplastic mesonephric cells into endodermal cells. \nOral magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes. Reduced magnesium (Mg) levels have been reported in women affected by premenstrual syndrome (PMS). To evaluate the effects of an oral Mg preparation on premenstrual symptoms, we studied, by a double-blind, randomized design, 32 women (24-39 years old) with PMS confirmed by the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire. After 2 months of baseline recording, the subjects were randomly assigned to placebo or Mg for two cycles. In the next two cycles, both groups received Mg. Magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (360 mg Mg) or placebo was administered three times a day, from the 15th day of the menstrual cycle to the onset of menstrual flow. Blood samples for Mg measurement were drawn premenstrually, during the baseline period, and in the second and fourth months of treatment. The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster \"pain\" was significantly reduced during the second month in both groups, whereas Mg treatment significantly affected both the total Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score and the cluster \"negative affect.\" In the second month, the women assigned to treatment showed a significant increase in Mg in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells, whereas no changes were observed in plasma and erythrocytes. These data indicate that Mg supplementation could represent an effective treatment of premenstrual symptoms related to mood changes. \nQuality of life in long-term survivors of CNS tumors of childhood and adolescence. Clinical reports of small numbers of pediatric brain tumor patients observed for brief periods suggest that long-term survivors continue to have major handicaps into adulthood. To quantify these late effects we interviewed 342 adults (or their proxies) who had CNS tumors diagnosed before the age of 20 between 1945 and 1974, survived at least 5 years, and reached 21 years of age. Survivors were 32 years old on average at follow-up. When compared with 479 matched siblings as controls. CNS tumor survivors were more likely to have died or to have become mentally incompetent sometime during the follow-up period. They were more likely to be at risk for such adverse outcomes as unemployment (odds ratio [OR], 10.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6 to 25.7], to have a health condition that affected their ability to work (OR, 5.9; CI, 3.7 to 9.4), to be unable to drive (OR, 28.8; CI, 6.9 to 119.9), or to describe their current health as poor (OR, 7.8; CI, 1.7 to 35.7). Unfavorable outcomes were more frequent in male survivors than in females, in those with supratentorial tumors compared with infratentorial ones, and in those who received radiation therapy. As clinicians consider improving therapies, they should anticipate late effects, such as those we observed, and attempt to target subgroups for interventions that may improve subsequent quality of life. \nDog bites in urban children. As a result of a perceived increase in pit bull injuries, all children who presented to The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during 1989 for evaluation of dog bite injuries were prospectively studied. Epidemiologic information was collected from parents, either at the time of visit or by phone on the following day. A total of 168 children were enrolled; the mean age was 8 years. Males outnumbered females 1.5:1. Most (61%) injuries occurred in or around the home and involved dogs known to the patient (77%). Types of injuries included abrasions (33%), punctures (29%), and lacerations (38%). Thirteen bites had associated complications; nine developed infection. Twelve (7%) children required admission to the hospital. More than 12 different purebreeds or cross-breeds were identified as perpetrators, including German shepherds (n = 35), pit bulls (n = 33), rottweilers (n = 9), and Dobermans (n = 7). Most (54%) animals were contained (ie, leashed, fenced, in-house) at the time of injury. Fewer (46%) were provoked prior to biting. Significantly more pit bull injuries (94% vs 43%, P less than .001) were the consequence of unprovoked attacks and involved freely roaming animals (67% vs 41%, P less than .01). Children aged 5 or younger were more likely to provoke animals prior to injury than were older children (69% vs 36%, P less than .001). It is recommended that families with young children be the target of pet safety education and that measures be sought that would lead to early identification of a potentially dangerous dog and restrict ownership. \nMegaduodenum due to hollow visceral myopathy successfully managed by duodenoplasty and feeding jejunostomy. A 29 year old man with a history of childhood polymyositis developed insulin dependent diabetes and was found coincidentally to have chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction due to visceral myopathy. Multiple full thickness biopsy specimens showed severe disease in the duodenum and the proximal jejunum only, with less involvement distally. Total parenteral nutrition has been avoided for more than a year by enteral feeding through a fine bore jejunostomy catheter positioned with its tip in the distal jejunum. \nPatient-controlled on-demand epidural fentanyl. A comparison of patient-controlled on-demand fentanyl delivered epidurally or intravenously. A prospective, open, clinical trial is described in which 20 patients having upper abdominal surgery were randomly allocated to receive fentanyl for postoperative analgesia by patient-controlled demand analgesic computer by either the epidural or intravenous route. Hourly pain, sedation and nausea scores were very similar in the two groups during the first 24 hours after surgery. What few differences there were favoured the epidural group. There was a highly significant difference in fentanyl consumption between the two groups, with the intravenous group demanding consistently more than twice as much as the epidural group. \nEtiology of acute respiratory infections in children in tropical southern India. Nasopharyngeal secretions and throat-swab specimens from 809 children less than 6 years old with acute respiratory infection were examined by culture and indirect immunofluorescence for the presence of virus or viral antigen. Blood was cultured for the presence of bacteria in selected cases of lower respiratory infection (LRI); pleural fluid also was cultured in cases of empyema. Viruses were detected in 163 (49%) of 331 children with LRI. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the commonest agent isolated (106 children). Other viruses isolated included parainfluenza viruses (36 children), adenoviruses (12), and influenza viruses (five). Outbreaks of infection due to RSV occurred during August through October. Pneumonia was the commonest LRI encountered (178 children). Among children with pneumonia, viruses were detected in 65 (37%) of 178 children, and bacteria were isolated from 27 (18%) of the 147 children for whom blood cultures were done. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus were the common bacterial pathogens isolated. In cases of empyema and pyopneumothorax, S. aureus was the commonest organism isolated. There were 116 children with bronchiolitis, 83 (72%) of whom had viral infections; the majority of these children (81%) had RSV infection. Croup was uncommon (eight cases) and was caused mainly by parainfluenza viruses. \nParacentesis with intravenous infusion of albumin as compared with peritoneovenous shunting in cirrhosis with refractory ascites. BACKGROUND. There is no satisfactory treatment for refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Both peritoneovenous shunts and paracentesis have been used, but there is uncertainty about their relative merits. METHODS. We studied 89 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites who were randomly assigned to receive either repeated large-volume paracentesis plus intravenous albumin or a LeVeen peritoneovenous shunt. Patients in the paracentesis group in whom recurrent tense ascites developed during follow-up were treated with paracentesis, and those in the peritoneovenous-shunt group with diuretic agents or by the insertion of a new shunt if there was shunt obstruction. RESULTS. During the first hospitalization, ascites was removed in all 41 patients in the paracentesis group and in 44 of the 48 patients in the peritoneovenous-shunt group. The mean (+/- SD) duration of hospitalization in the two groups was 11 +/- 5 and 19 +/- 9 days, respectively (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in the number of patients who had complications or died. During follow-up, 37 patients in each group were hospitalized again. In the paracentesis group, the number of rehospitalizations for any reason (174 vs. 97 in the peritoneovenous-shunt group) or for ascites (125 vs. 38) was significantly higher, and the median time to a first readmission for any reason (1 +/- 1 vs. 2 +/- 2 months) or for ascites (2 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 17 months) was significantly shorter than in the peritoneovenous-shunt group. The total times in the hospital during follow-up, however, were similar in the two groups (48 +/- 49 and 44 +/- 39 days, respectively). Three patients had obstructions of their peritoneovenous shunts during their first hospitalizations, and 15 patients had a total of 20 obstructions during follow-up. Survival was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS. The LeVeen shunt and paracentesis are equally effective in relieving refractory ascites. The former may provide better long-term control of ascites, but shunt occlusion is common and survival is not improved. \nDietary fish oil blocks the microcirculatory manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury in striated muscle in hamsters. Epidemiologic observations and experimental studies have demonstrated a protective effect of dietary fish oil on the clinical manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we used the dorsal skinfold chamber model for intravital fluorescence microscopy of the microcirculation in striated muscle of awake hamsters. In control hamsters (n = 7), reperfusion after a 4-hr pressure-induced ischemia to the muscle tissue elicited the adhesion of fluorescently stained leukocytes to the endothelium of postcapillary venules, capillary obstruction, and the break-down of endothelial integrity. These microvascular manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury were significantly attenuated in animals (n = 7) when fed with a fish oil-enriched diet for 4 weeks prior to the experiments. In leukocyte total lipids, the fish oil diet resulted in a substantial displacement of arachidonic acid, the precursor of the potent adhesion-promoting leukotriene (LT) B4, by fish oil-derived eicosapentaenoic acid, the precursor of biologically less potent LTB5, emphasizing the mediator role of LTB4 in ischemia-reperfusion injury. These results suggest that the preservation of microvascular perfusion by dietary fish oil contributes to its protective effects on the clinical manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury. \nExternal anal sphincter function in spinal patients. Electromyographic and manometric study. Six patients with complete transection of the spinal cord and six healthy volunteers were examined by using anorectal manometry together with electromyographic (EMG) recording of the external anal sphincter composed of striated muscle. Anal pressure and EMG activity of the external anal sphincter were continuously recorded at rest and during gradual rectal distention (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 ml) by means of an air-filled balloon eliciting a rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) at the upper part, and an inflation reflex (IR) at the lower part of the anal canal. All patients and controls had a RAIR for each rectal distention volume. A relationship between the duration of the RAIR and the rectal distention volume was present in controls only. In controls the IR was present for each rectal distention volume, whereas it was present in only one patient for a 40-ml volume. During the resting period, all controls showed continuous tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter, but after 30 minutes all the patients showed a decrease and ultimately in five cases a disappearance of the tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter. In spinal patients, the presence or absence of EMG activity of the external anal sphincter did not modify the anal canal pressure. These results indicate that: 1) the tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter seems to be under the control of supraspinal structures, because in spinal patients it disappears in the absence of sensitive inputs toward the spinal cord; 2) the absence of EMG activity at rest indicates that the external anal sphincter is not implicated in the RAIR disturbances observed in spinal patients; 3) the IR is not a spinal reflex but is under voluntary control, because it is not present in spinal humans; 4) in spinal humans the tonic EMG activity of the external anal sphincter does not play a role in the maintenance of the anal pressure at rest. \nABO(H) antigens and beta-2 microglobulin in transitional cell carcinoma. Predictors of response to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin. The response of patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (STCB) to intravesical chemotherapy is variable; some patients enjoy a long period without recurrence, whereas others have recurrence of tumor within 2 years of removal of the primary lesion. Previously, others have demonstrated that the loss of normal cell surface antigens, such as ABO(H) blood group antigens or beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) has been correlated with more aggressive behavior by tumor. In this study, using immunohistochemical techniques, the authors evaluated the initial pretreatment biopsy specimen of bladder tumors for the presence of ABO(H) antigens and B2M. Data from this sample patient population, all with biopsy-proven STCB, indicate that expression of these two markers is predictive of a therapeutic response to prophylactic intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Tice strain) after resection, and that expression of the two markers is of greater predictive value than expression of either antigen alone. \nModulation of catecholamine cardiomyopathy by allopurinol. It has been suggested that cardiac injury by catecholamines may be the result of coronary constriction leading to ischemic damage. Allopurinol (ALLO) has been shown to reduce the extent of myocardial necrosis in various systems. Hence the possibility that ALLO might limit norepinephrine (NE) injury was tested. Rabbit hearts were infused with NE (3 micrograms/min/kg) for 90 minutes, with or without ALLO (50 micrograms/min/kg). Control specimens infused with saline solution plus ALLO were also prepared. Hearts were excised 48 hours later and studied as isovolumic isolated heart preparations. Peak systolic pressure, coronary flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption were significantly reduced in the hearts infused with NE but not in the NE + ALLO hearts. Myocardial adenosine triphosphate and glycogen concentrations were 29% and 26% lower in the NE hearts compared with control hearts. These reductions were absent in the NE + ALLO group. Moreover, rates of creatine phosphokinase and lactic dehydrogenase release were sharply elevated in the NE hearts but not in those also given ALLO. These findings are consistent with the changes observed histologically. The amount of myocardial damage was less in the ALLO + NE group compared with the NE group (p less than 0.02). This appears to be the first report to demonstrate that ALLO reduces myocyte damage by NE. Possible mechanisms include decreased free radical production, scavenging of free radicals, and preservation of the adenine nucleotide pool. Because xanthine oxidase activity is absent in the rabbit, the latter two mechanisms are more likely explanations for the findings. \nA case of autoerotic asphyxia associated with multiplex paraphilia. During the past 20 years, the sensational aspects of autoerotic fatalities have captured the attention of medical examiners, psychiatrists, law enforcement agents, and the public, as well as the individuals themselves who engage in these dangerous practices. Reports of deaths related to sexual asphyxia have been presented numerous times at national and international meetings and have been the topic of discussion on television talk shows and in the press. Autoerotic fatalities and all the sexual curiosities related to these activities have prompted death scene investigators to publish case reports, and even textbooks, on the subject. The case presented herein is one of a multicomponent paraphilia in which self-asphyxiation (autoasphyxiophilia) led to a fatal autoerotic event. \nParoxysmal tremor and orofacial dyskinesia secondary to a biopterin synthesis defect. We report a child with a systemic biopterin synthesis defect due to an absence of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase who had an unusual presentation, with three episodes of coarse \"rubral-like\" tremor in arms and legs orofacial dyskinesia between the ages of 3 and 6 months. Response to levodopa therapy and CSF neurotransmitter metabolite concentrations before and after therapy suggests that his clinical syndrome resulted from a secondary dopamine deficiency. \nMetabolic and work efficiencies during exercise in Andean natives. Maximum O2 and CO2 fluxes during exercise were less perturbed by hypoxia in Quechua natives from the Andes than in lowlanders. In exploring how this was achieved, we found that, for a given work rate, Quechua highlanders at 4,200 m accumulated substantially less lactate than lowlanders at sea level normoxia (approximately 5-7 vs. 10-14 mM) despite hypobaric hypoxia. This phenomenon, known as the lactate paradox, was entirely refractory to normoxia-hypoxia transitions. In lowlanders, the lactate paradox is an acclimation; however, in Quechuas, the lactate paradox is an expression of metabolic organization that did not deacclimate, at least over the 6-wk period of our study. Thus it was concluded that this metabolic organization is a developmentally or genetically fixed characteristic selected because of the efficiency advantage of aerobic metabolism (high ATP yield per mol of substrate metabolized) compared with anaerobic glycolysis. Measurements of respiratory quotient indicated preferential use of carbohydrate as fuel for muscle work, which is also advantageous in hypoxia because it maximizes the yield of ATP per mol of O2 consumed. Finally, minimizing the cost of muscle work was also reflected in energetic efficiency as classically defined (power output per metabolic power input); this was evident at all work rates but was most pronounced at submaximal work rates (efficiency approximately 1.5 times higher than in lowlander athletes). Because plots of power output vs. metabolic power input did not extrapolate to the origin, it was concluded 1) that exercise in both groups sustained a significant ATP expenditure not convertible to mechanical work but 2) that this expenditure was downregulated in Andean natives by thus far unexplained mechanisms. \nAbnormal vasomotor changes early after coronary angioplasty. A quantitative arteriographic study of their time course. BACKGROUND. To study the impact of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on coronary vasomotion, we prospectively analyzed spontaneous changes in coronary diameter and the response to the cold pressor test and intracoronary nitroglycerin in 11 patients subjected to successful single-vessel PTCA. METHODS AND RESULTS. All antianginal medications were stopped 48 hours before each study. The minimum diameter of the PTCA segment and the diameter of a distal segment in the angioplastied vessel and of a segment in a control vessel not manipulated by the balloon catheter or guide wire were measured by computerized edge detection immediately before PTCA and 5 minutes after, 4 hours after, and 8 days after PTCA. At 4 hours, PTCA and distal segments were constricted by 38 +/- 9% and 16 +/- 5%, respectively, compared with the values at 5 minutes (p less than 0.01). Before angioplasty, the cold pressor test caused vasoconstriction of PTCA and distal segments by 23 +/- 6% (p less than 0.0001) and 15 +/- 4% (p less than 0.008), respectively, but no constrictor response was elicited at 5 minutes or 4 hours after angioplasty. Eight days after PTCA, the basal coronary diameters were similar to those observed 5 minutes after PTCA and the response to the cold pressor test was similar to that observed before PTCA. All segments dilated significantly with nitroglycerin at all times, and no vasoconstriction changes were found in the control segments. CONCLUSIONS. Four hours after PTCA, transient spontaneous vasoconstriction of the PTCA and distal segments occurs, which is so intense that the cold pressor test does not cause any further constriction. These abnormalities resolve within 8 days of PTCA. \nThe histologic reliability of laser cone biopsy of the cervix. Laser conization of the cervix has been advocated as the technique of choice for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in preference to ablative techniques, because it provides a specimen for histologic diagnosis while retaining the advantages of an outpatient procedure with minimal short- and long-term morbidity. To determine whether specimens so obtained are adequate for reliable histologic diagnosis, we reviewed 77 laser conizations performed for lesions confirmed to contain CIN in a colposcopically directed biopsy and satisfying the criteria for local ablation and scored the cones for the presence of epithelial denudation and laser coagulation artifact that interfered with the diagnosis of CIN or the assessment of the margins of excision. Thirty specimens (39%) were negative for CIN. Twenty-eight (36%) showed extensive epithelial denudation, ten (13%) contained coagulation artifact that made recognition of CIN extremely difficult or impossible, and in 11 (14%), assessment of margins was extremely difficult or impossible because of laser coagulation artifact. We conclude that these difficulties with the histologic interpretation of laser cone specimens make it an unsuitable excisional technique when reliable histologic diagnosis of cervical lesions is required. \nAlpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes and alcoholic pancreatitis. Altered frequencies of alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes have been reported in patients with chronic pancreatitis, suggesting a possible genetic basis for individual susceptibility to this disease. Alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes, with particular regard to alcoholic pancreatitis, were studied. Patients with alcoholic pancreatitis were compared with alcoholic control subjects with no history of pancreatic disease. Serum alpha 1 antitrypsin concentrations were raised in pancreatitis patients sampled within one month of an acute attack of pancreatitis, but otherwise values were similar to those of control subjects. There were no significant differences in alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes between alcoholics with pancreatitis and alcoholic control subjects. This study of alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes provides no evidence of an inherited susceptibility to alcoholic pancreatitis. \nAvoidance of cancellation of potential hyperstimulation cycles by conversion to in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to minimize the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation and to avoid cancellation of human treatment cycles in women treated with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) for induction of ovulation. SETTING: Patients were treated in the fertility clinic and in vitro fertilization unit of our institution, which is a government, university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Ninety anovulatory patients were treated with hMG. Of these, 12 were at high risk for ovarian hyperstimulation. The criteria for potential ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were rising excessive 17 beta-estradiol levels of greater than 1,500 pg/mL in the presence of multiple follicles with a mean diameter greater than 15 mm. These patients were transferred for continuation of treatment to our in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) unit. INTERVENTIONS: The patients underwent ova retrieval by the ultrasonically guided transvaginal approach. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients, 5 conceived (41.6%). Two patients had a mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and 1 had a moderate syndrome and was hospitalized for observation for 48 hours. CONCLUSION: In view of the results, we suggest that IVF-ET should be considered in cases in which ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is imminent, rather than withhold human chorionic gonadotropin and cancelling the treatment cycle. \nPlasma and saliva levels of PGI2 and TXA2 in the headache-free period of classical migraine patients. The effects of nicardipine. The levels of Prostacyclin (PGI2) and Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) were assayed simultaneously (RIA) in the plasma and saliva of 9 patients suffering from classical migraine attacks. The assays were done during an attack-free period. In relation to the control group we observed a significant decrease in the plasma levels of PGI2 together with a sharp increase in TXA2 in saliva. When the patients were treated with nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, the TXA2 increase in saliva did not occur. These results suggest both a systemic and local effect in the classical migraine attacks. We explain and discuss our results by referring to the PGI2: TXA2 equilibrium system. Nicardipine action might be related to its ability to reduce the calcium entry into the cell induced by thromboxane. \nUnusual intramandibular neural tumor. Neural tumors within the jaw bones are exceptional. We present the histologic observation of a central mandibular tumor of neural origin. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the neural nature of the tumor, which had features of a schwannoma (neurilemmoma) together with ganglion cells as seen in ganglioneuroma. Moreover, the association with an intracranial tumor, possibly a meningioma, is emphasized. \nSimultaneous esophageal pH monitoring and scintigraphy during the postprandial period in patients with severe reflux esophagitis. To compare reflux events detected by intraesophageal pH monitoring with that of scintigraphy, we simultaneously performed both techniques along with esophageal manometry in nine patients with severe reflux esophagitis. Two hundred eighteen reflux events were detected in the recumbent posture after a meal during a 40-min interval. Both techniques simultaneously detected only 23% of all reflux events. Scintigraphy alone detected 61% of all reflux events as opposed to 16% for pH monitoring. Of those reflux events diagnosed only by scintigraphy, more occurred while the intraesophageal pH was less than 4 (ie, during an acid-clearing interval) than while the intraesophageal pH was greater than 4 (ie, when intragastric contents were neutralized by the meal). Most reflux events occurred during periods of stable, but low LES pressure. While reflux events diagnosed by scintigraphy significantly decreased during the second of two 20-min postprandial intervals, those by pH monitoring tended to increase. That simultaneous scintigraphy and pH monitoring agreed on less than 1/3 of all reflux events not only underscores the fact that both techniques measured different physical components of the esophageal refluxate (ie, volume vs acid concentration, respectively), but also were influenced by different physiologic events such as the ingestion of a meal, gastric emptying, and esophageal acid clearance. \nPain centers--organization and outcome. Pain treatment centers have evolved at a rapid rate, but they differ in their complexity and services provided. Patients, as well as primary care physicians, have difficulty in identifying the appropriate center for a specific problem. Guidelines for pain centers have recently been proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain, along with an attempt at their accreditation. Outcome studies from pain centers have proliferated, with a wide range of treatment programs being reported. Comprehensive multidisciplinary pain centers using the rehabilitation medicine approach are effective in decreasing disability and increasing the productivity of patients with chronic, disabling pain. \nQuantitation of axon loss and conduction block in peroneal nerve palsies. We compared conduction in motor fibers supplying the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) and anterior lateral compartment (AL) muscles. The object was to determine whether there were any differences in the relative proportions of degenerated and blocked nerve fibers between the longer EDB and shorter AL fibers. In almost every case the percentage of motor fibers undergoing axonal degeneration was greatest in EDB fibers. Conversely, the percentage of conduction block was greatest in the AL motor fibers. As clinical recovery is dependent on AL muscles rather than EDB, electrophysiological study of the relative proportions of degenerated and blocked fibers in the former should provide a more reliable measure of outcome than similar studies of EDB. Conduction velocity distal to the fibular head was not slowed despite the large loss of EDB motor fibers. Evidence for selective involvement of the larger myelinated fibers is, therefore, lacking. The location of the major conduction abnormalities was in almost every case between the mid-fibular head and popliteal fossa. \nDepression and chronic fatigue in the patient with chronic pain. Chronic benign pain is commonly associated with chronic fatigue and depression. Depression and chronic fatigue syndrome are also associated with each other and often include pain. Psychologic factors are prominent in these conditions, and they may share neurobiologic factors as well. Management requires separately addressing each component of patients' distress and usually includes physical rehabilitation, education, administration of nonhabituating medications and often counseling. Depression may be a favorable prognostic sign, as it suggests a treatable condition and provides incentive for recovery. \nDemethylation of CpG islands in embryonic cells. DNA in differentiated somatic cells has a fixed pattern of methylation, which is faithfully copied after replication. By contrast, the methylation patterns of many tissue-specific and some housekeeping genes are altered during normal development. This modification of DNA methylation in the embryo has also been observed in transgenic mice and in transfection experiments. Here we report the fate in mice of an in vitro-methylated adenine phosphoribosyltransferase transgene. The entire 5' CpG island region became demethylated, whereas the 3' end of the gene remained modified and was even methylated de novo at additional sites. Transfection experiments in vitro show that the demethylation is rapid, is specific for embryonic cell-types and affects a variety of different CpG island sequences. This suggests that gene sequences can be recognized in the early embryo and imprinted with the correct methylation pattern through a combination of demethylation and de novo methylation. \nNeisseria lactamica meningitis following skull trauma. A woman developed meningitis due to Neisseria lactamica in association with a cribriform plate fracture. Cerebrospinal fluid antigen tests for Neisseria meningitidis were negative. The patient recovered with intravenous penicillin therapy. N. lactamica can be rapidly distinguished from N. meningitidis by the hydrolysis of ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside). In contrast to N. meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. lactamica lacks virulence properties. As 100% of N. lactamica strains are susceptible to penicillin and all three previously described patients with N. lactamica meningitis have recovered with penicillin treatment, the reason for distinguishing the organisms in this context is primarily to prevent unnecessary anxiety and prophylaxis among contacts. \nPotential impact of exclusion criteria on results of hyperten",
