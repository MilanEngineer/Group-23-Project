        "text": " the patients with primary aldosteronism compared with those with essential hypertension (p less than 0.01), and it was smaller than in the normotensive subjects (p less than 0.1). Furthermore, MSNA, plasma renin activity, and the plasma concentration of angiotensin II decreased significantly in five patients with renovascular hypertension 4-10 days after successful percutaneous renal angioplasty. Thus, the changes in MSNA seem to characterize the pathophysiology of renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system may be involved in the increase in the central outflow of sympathetic nerve activity, thus exacerbating hypertension in patients with renovascular hypertension. \nThe growth hormone, prolactin and TSH response to TRH and L-dopa in patients with hyperprolactinaemia and a normal-sized sella turcica may denote a pituitary adenoma. Forty-one patients with hyperprolactinaemia and suspected prolactinomas were studied. Growth hormone (GH) and thyrotropin (TSH) secretory patterns after thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were affected in the majority of patients. The disturbances were observed regardless of tumour size as indicated by the radiological sella size. In patients with hyperprolactinaemia and normal-sized sella turcica, an abnormal GH and TSH response to TRH can be helpful in the diagnosis of a microadenoma. The hyperprolactinaemia per se and its effect on dopaminergic hypothalamic neurones may be the cause of the GH and TSH response. By contrast, many patients with macroprolactinomas showed insufficient GH secretory capacity. \nProgressive congestive heart failure. Ways to approach office management. Treatment of congestive heart failure depends on the cause, precipitating factors, and symptoms of the disease in each patient. Dr Kahn outlines the use of the three main types of pharmacologic agents given for heart failure--diuretics, vasodilators, and digoxin. He describes a stepwise regimen, whereby agents are added as needed to improve symptoms and prolong life. \nIncreased plasma apolipoprotein(a) levels in IDDM patients with microalbuminuria. Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) have a significantly increased risk of macrovascular disease, particularly if they have persistent proteinuria. To determine whether altered levels of apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], the plasminogenlike glycoprotein of the potentially atherogenic lipoprotein(a); contribute to the increased risk of atherosclerosis, apo(a) levels were measured in 107 patients with IDDM and compared with nondiabetic control subjects and male elective coronary artery graft patients. Apo(a) levels were increased in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria (geometric mean 245 U/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 142-427, n = 30) and albuminuria (mean 196 U/L, 95% CI 97-397, n = 18) with levels comparable to patients with coronary artery disease (mean 193 U/L, 95% CI 126-298, n = 40), which were higher than in the control group (mean 107 U/L, 95% CI 85-134, n = 140; P = 0.016). Apo(a) levels in diabetic patients without microalbuminuria (mean 86 U/L, 95% CI 63-116, n = 59) were comparable with the control population and less than in those with microalbuminuria (P less than 0.001) and albuminuria (P = 0.014). The elevated apo(a) levels found in patients with IDDM and increased urinary albumin loss may contribute to their heightened risk of macrovascular disease. \nDeglycosylation of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor is impaired in the faeces of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease). 1. alpha 1-Proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-antitrypsin) was excreted in the faeces of patients with inflammatory bowel disease in different molecular forms: Mr-51,000 and Mr-45,000 forms were widely found in the stools of patients with active disease, whereas a Mr-38,000 species was frequently recovered from healthy subjects and patients with quiescent disease (Mizon, Becuwe, Balduyck et al. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34, 2268-70). 2. N-Terminal sequencing of the Mr-38,000 form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, after SDS/PAGE and electrotransfer on polyvinyl difluoride membranes, showed that it differed from plasma alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor by the loss of 17 N-terminal amino acids. 3. Carbohydrate analysis of the isolated Mr-38,000 form revealed a total lack of neutral sugars. 4. In contrast, the Mr-51,000 form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor is glycosylated and thus could be differentiated by virtue of its reactivity with concanavalin A. The analysis of 25 faecal extracts from patients with Crohn's disease allowed us to confirm that the presence of the glycosylated form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor was closely related to the degree of inflammation. 5. From these data, it may be hypothesized that the hydrolytic activity of some glycosidases is greatly reduced in active Crohn's disease. \nPattern of treatment failure following laser for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: implications for follow-up protocol. In an effort to devise a rational protocol for the follow-up of patients who have had destructive treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), an analysis has been performed of treatment failures following laser therapy in 2130 women treated between 1980-1989. Of this group, 1253 women have been followed up for 3 years or more and 380 for 6 years or more. There have been 119 treatment failures (5.6%), of which 71% of the women had the second lesion detected during the first year of follow-up, 24% during the second year, 3.3% during the third year, and 1.7% during the sixth year. In 18% of these 119, the second lesion was detected colposcopically in the presence of negative cytology. There were two cases of microinvasion and one frankly invasive lesion following laser, all diagnosed during the second year of follow-up. Our data suggest that if the first year of follow-up includes at least one colposcopic examination, some second lesions will be diagnosed in the presence of negative cytology. \nThe potential utility of a rapid CK-MB assay in evaluating emergency department patients with possible myocardial infarction. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of a new rapid creatine kinase-MB (R-CK-MB) assay compared with a standard CK-MB (S-CK-MB) assay and to determine its potential use in the evaluation of emergency department patients with possible myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Retrospective patient identification with subsequent testing of excess sera for CK-MB and total CK using an identity-unlinked procedure. SETTING: Large, urban, teaching hospital ED. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients with excess sera and one of several defined presentations chosen to identify those with possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. Patients with clearly documented noncardiac etiologies of their symptoms or signs were excluded. MAIN RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 271 patient specimens for the R-CK-MB assay compared with the S-CK-MB assay were 100%, 96.8%, 75.0%, and 100%, respectively. The R-CK-MB assay was positive for 32 patients (11.8%). Of these, eight (25.0%) were admitted to unmonitored beds, and five (15.6%) were discharged home. All of these 13 patients had initial ECGs without evidence of ischemia or infarction. On follow-up, at least eight of the 13 had evidence of infarction. CONCLUSION: The R-CK-MB assay demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity compared with the S-CK-MB assay. When used for patients in whom a cardiac care unit admission is not considered, the rapid assay may identify some patients with unsuspected myocardial infarction and prevent inadvertent discharge or admission to unmonitored beds. \nPlacebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial of growth hormone treatment in prepubertal children with chronic renal failure. Stunted growth is a serious problem for children with chronic renal failure (CRF) despite normal endogenous growth hormone secretion and normal or elevated plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factors (IGF) I and II. Biosynthetic growth hormone (GH) was given to 20 prepubertal children (eleven boys, nine girls; mean age 9.5 years, range 4-16) with CRF and severe growth retardation in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial. 6 months of subcutaneous injection of GH (4 IU/m2 per day) was either preceded or followed by 6 months of placebo injection. The patients had a full examination every 3 months. Sixteen children completed the study. Height velocity improved significantly with GH therapy (p less than 0.0001) and placebo (p less than 0.04), but the GH-induced height-velocity increase exceeded that of placebo by 2.9 cm per 6 months. There was a positive relationship between prestudy height velocity and height-velocity increase. Bone maturation was not affected. GH caused a significant increase in IGF-I and a moderate increase in IGF-II plasma concentrations. The pretreatment elevation of IGF-binding protein-1 decreased by almost 50% during GH therapy, while IGF-binding protein-3 increased significantly in concentration, although this increase was significantly smaller than the GH-induced increase in IGF-I. Fructosamine, lipid, and parathyroid concentrations remained constant. Renal function deterioration did not accelerate. Impressive height-velocity increase can be achieved with GH therapy in children with CRF and growth retardation without changes in renal function. Bone maturation appears unaffected suggesting improved final height. Treatment is best started before growth retardation becomes considerable. \nIntracranial extension of a naso-ethmoid schwannoma. A rare case of intracranial extension of a naso-ethmoid schwannoma is presented. Its subsequent removal with few sequelae confirmed the benign nature and good prognosis of the disease. \nAlpha-blocker therapy of hypertension. An unfulfilled promise. For various reasons, the alpha 1-receptor blocker prazosin has been used infrequently as initial therapy for hypertension. The introduction of additional agents of this class with properties different from prazosin provides slower onset of action, which should reduce the degree of first-dose and postural hypotension and a longer duration of action, which allows for once-a-day dosage. A summary of the published data on efficacy, side effects, and special properties of this class of agents indicates that they will probably be used more extensively, particularly because of their ability to improve lipid and glucose-insulin metabolism. \nPostmortem studies of the heart in three fatal cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hearts of individuals who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan, with particular attention paid to the coronary arteries, the neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart because of reported terminal disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction. STUDY MATERIAL: Three hearts fixed in neutral formalin and well preserved with all the relevant areas of conduction system intact. METHODS: Light microscopic examination of subserial sections of the sinus node, atrioventricular node and His bundle, coronary chemoreceptor and regional nerves, ganglia, and small coronary arteries. Routine stains used were Goldner trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson. RESULTS: Arterial abnormalities were numerous and primarily of two types: focal fibromuscular dysplasia causing moderate to severe narrowing, as well as endarteritis and panarteritis. Extensive examples of neuritis and ganglionitis were present throughout the heart, including the conduction system, where arterial abnormalities were also abundant. In the coronary chemoreceptor there were both old and new lesions comprising focal inflammation with degeneration as well as older areas of fibrotic destruction. Within the sinus node, areas of dense fibrosis replaced all nodal tissue. These abnormalities were similar in nature and extent in all three hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic lesions present in the coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system of the heart in patients who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome provide a suitable anatomic substrate for substantial cardiac electrical instability, including the occurrence of sudden death. In cases of unexplained cardiac electrical instability or sudden unexpected death an inquiry should be made about previous use of L-tryptophan. In patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the possibility of cardiac electrical instability should be considered as part of long-range clinical management. \nNeurokinin and NMDA antagonists (but not a kainic acid antagonist) are antinociceptive in the mouse formalin model. While much evidence implicates substance P (SP), an endogenous neurokinin (NK), as a primary sensory transmitter of acute pain in mammalian spinal cord, its role in continuous (tonic) pain is less clear. Although glutamate is co-localized with SP in dorsal root ganglion neurons, its role in nociceptive processing is uncertain. While antagonists of NKs and excitatory amino acids (EAAs) have been found to be antinociceptive in some acute assays, they have not been tested against tonic pain. We hypothesize that: (1) NKs and EAAs contribute to signaling of tonic chemogenic nociception; and (2) interaction between NK and EAA systems is important in determining the perceived intensity of a continuous noxious stimulus. We therefore evaluated two NK antagonists ([D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9] SP (DPDT-SP, 0.26-6.6 nmoles, non-specific) and [D-Pro4, D-Trp7,9,10,Phe11]-SP(4-11) (DPDTP-octa, 1.6-12.3 nmoles, somewhat NK-1 selective], as well as DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (DL-AP5, NMDA antagonist, 0.05-1 nmole) and urethane (a kainic acid (KA) antagonist at 2.5 mumoles) for antinociceptive activity in the mouse formalin model. Administered intrathecally (i.t.), DL-AP5 and both NK antagonists were significantly antinociceptive while urethane (2.5 mumoles) and naloxone (2.7 nmoles) were inactive. A50 values for mean % analgesia, nmoles/mouse i.t. (95% CLs) were: DPDT-SP, 1.1 (0.79-1.6); DPDTP-octa, 3.9 (2.4-6.1); DL-AP5, 0.29 (0.16-0.71). The antinociception associated with 1.3 nmoles of DPDT-SP was not reversed by co-administering 2.7 nmoles of naloxone. Co-administration of 0.1 nmoles of DL-AP5 with either 1.3 nmoles of DPDT-SP or 3.3 nmoles of DPDTP-octa did not lead to additive antinociception. \nCost-effectiveness of prophylaxis in total hip replacement. A theoretical analysis was performed regarding the cost-effectiveness in terms of lives saved (reduction of fatal pulmonary embolism [PE]) and in terms of money (dollars spent for prevention and treatment) of seven strategies in the management of venous thromboembolic disease in patients over 39 years of age undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR). Strikingly, this theoretical analysis suggests that low-dose warfarin combined with clinical surveillance of deep vein thrombosis would reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 20 per 1,000 patients to 4 per 1,000 patients and simultaneously reduce the charges for venous thromboembolic disease from $550,000 to about $400,000 per 1,000 patients. Based on this analysis, we strongly recommend this measure on a routine basis. Adding venography or duplex sonography routinely to this prophylactic regimen would, in this theoretical analysis, reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 4 per 1,000 patients to 0.15 per 1,000, but adds charges of $200,000 per extra life saved in the case of routine venography and $50,000 in the case of routine sonography. Low-dose warfarin prophylaxis combined with routine sonography does not generate more charges than no prophylaxis with no screening while drastically reducing the incidence of fatal PE from 20 to 0.3 per 1,000 patients. Where duplex sonography is not easily available, a 12-week postoperative course of low-dose warfarin for every patient with no routine screening will be efficacious in reducing fatal PE and as cost-effective. \nCell-mediated immunologic responses and recurrent genital herpes in the guinea pig. Effects of glycoprotein immunotherapy. The specific immune alterations associated with HSV recurrences are ill defined although it appears that alterations in cell-mediated immune mechanisms are more likely associated with recurrent disease than humoral immunity. Immunization with HSV glycoproteins B and D (gBgD) after primary HSV infection has reportedly reduced the frequency of recurrences but the mechanisms remain unidentified. We therefore evaluated the effects of immunization with cloned gBgD on selected cell-mediated immune responses and their relationship to recurrent disease by using the guinea pig model of genital HSV-2 infection. In two experiments, immunization with gBgD + CFA on days 21 and 42 after HSV-2 inoculation significantly decreased the number of subsequent recurrent lesion days observed whereas CFA alone had no effect. Immunization with gBgD + CFA increased the lymphoproliferative and in vitro IL-2 response to gBgD more than to whole HSV-2 Ag preparations. Peak responses were observed 2 wk after the second immunization. The HSV-specific cytolytic response was also persistently increased beginning 1 wk after the first immunization. Analysis including both untreated and gBgD-immunized animals revealed that recurrent lesion days were inversely correlated to the IL-2 response to whole HSV-2 Ag (p less than 0.0001), the IL-2 response to gBgD (p = 0.0004), and the HSV-specific cytolytic response (p = 0.005 and 0.003 in two experiments, respectively). When the untreated group was analyzed separately, only the IL-2 response to whole HSV-2 Ag correlated to recurrences (p = 0.007). HSV glycoprotein immunization may increase IL-2 or other cytokines secreted by HSV-sensitized T cells increasing critical immune responses, such as NK- or lymphokine-activated killer-mediated cytolysis, that could eliminate the reactivated virus before the development of clinically apparent lesions. \nMemory and pain: tests of mood congruity and state dependent learning in experimentally induced and clinical pain. The associative network theory of memory [2] is outlined along with the concepts of mood congruity and state dependent learning. Two experiments are reported which investigate the occurrence of these effects where memory for pain is concerned. In experiment 1 the performance of 25 chronic pain patients was compared with that of 25 non-patient controls on a test involving both immediate and delayed recall of a mixed list of stimulus words of 3 types: pain-related, negative or neutral. No significant group differences were found in overall rates of immediate recall. As predicted, however, pain patients recalled more pain-related words than non-patient controls (P less than 0.001). On delayed recall the same significant group x word-type interaction was obtained (P less than 0.02), but in addition the non-patient controls recalled significantly more words overall (P less than 0.02). These results provide some evidence for the occurrence of a mood congruity effect. Experiment 2 investigated state dependent learning and mood congruity effects in experimentally induced pain. Twenty volunteer subjects were allocated to 1 of 4 conditions in which a wordlist (as in experiment 1) was presented following either a painful stimulus (cold pressor test) or a non-painful one (warm water) and was then recalled immediately following further exposure to stimulus conditions which were congruent with the original stimulus (warm/warm and cold/cold conditions) or non-congruent (warm/cold and cold/warm conditions). A 3-way split plot ANOVA yielded no significant main effects for group or word-type, but a significant interaction emerged between state at encoding and at recall (P less than 0.04). \nChronic subcorneal pustulosis with vasculitis: a variant of generalized pustular psoriasis in black South Africans. A rare, but distinctive chronic eruption in six female black South Africans is reported. The original diagnosis of subcorneal pustular dermatosis of Sneddon and Wilkinson in these patients was refuted by the subsequent histological observation of both spongiform pustules and an underlying vasculitis. This may represent a previously undocumented form of generalized pustular psoriasis. \nPiezogenic wrist papules: a common and asymptomatic finding. The first description of piezogenic wrist papules is presented. Twenty-nine persons were examined; 76% had pedal papules and 86% had wrist papules. Piezogenic papules are a common, nonhereditary finding and are not secondary to an inherent connective tissue defect. \nReview of neurobehavioral assessment tools. Behavioral, cognitive, and memory deficits are frequently observed sequelae of brain injury. Yet in most critical care settings, neurologic assessment is limited to evaluation of arousal, pupillary response, orientation, and motor capability. Behavior, cognition, and memory are not routinely evaluated. Several brief, bedside assessment tools are reviewed. All may be used in the critical care setting to evaluate the type and extent of residual deficits in the neurologically impaired patient. Nursing implications, based on the evaluation of deficits, are also discussed. \nSpontaneous carotid dissection: duplex scanning in diagnosis and management. The clinical, duplex, and angiographic findings in six patients with seven spontaneous extracranial carotid artery dissections are reported. Four dissections resulted in internal carotid artery occlusion. These patients complained of ipsilateral headache followed by contralateral hemiplegia. The other three dissections involved the common carotid artery and resulted in dual (one true and one false) lumens. Two of these dissections were asymptomatic. All dissections were treated nonoperatively with anticoagulant therapy. Neurologic deficits improved or disappeared in all symptomatic patients. On follow-up studies, one of the four internal carotid occlusions completely resolved with normalization of the duplex examination. All three dual lumen dissections remained patent on serial studies. Diagnostic duplex characteristics, both conclusive and supportive, of carotid dissections are described. Duplex scanning is shown to be accurate in diagnosing and ideally suited for serially following spontaneous carotid dissections. \nThe induction of epidermal ornithine decarboxylase following tape stripping is inhibited by a topical vitamin D3 analogue (MC903). The efficacy of MC903, a vitamin D3 analogue, in reducing hyperproliferation as determined by levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was investigated in a double-blind study of 15 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. The lesions of psoriasis were treated for 8 weeks with MC903 in one of two different cream bases or with a placebo cream. Biopsies were taken before and after treatment. In addition an uninvolved area of skin was treated during the last 3 weeks and this as well as control areas were then sellotape stripped and biopsied after 8 h. Clinical improvement was seen in eight out of 11 patients treated with MC903 but there was no reduction in the level of ODC in psoriatic lesions after 8 weeks of treatment. The levels of ODC in the tape-stripped uninvolved skin after 3 weeks of treatment with MC903 averaged 22.5 +/- 4.2 pmol/min/mg protein as compared to 58.6 +/- 12.6 pmol/min/mg protein (P = 0.004). The trauma-induced induction of ODC activity was markedly inhibited by the application of MC903. \nOral mucosal soft tissue necrosis caused by superinfection. Report of three cases. Three patients in whom flap necrosis developed after oral surgeries and antibiotic therapies were studied microbiologically by routine aerobic and anaerobic methods. In all cases the bacteria Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and coagulase-negative penicillinase-producing staphylococci were resistant to the antibiotics used. These bacteria are frequent microorganisms of superinfection and were not found after the necrotic tissues had repaired. \nMagnetic resonance imaging of cutaneous neoplasms: clinicopathologic correlation. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported to be clinically useful, in selected cases, in patients with melanocytic skin lesions. This report describes good resolution, clinically useful MRI scans of squamous cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma, and primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. The tumor depth measured by MRI was in excellent correlation with Breslow's depth measurements, indicating that MRI is probably the radiologic technique of choice for preoperative evaluation of the extent and depth of primary and recurrent skin tumors. This report also provides the authors' recommendations for obtaining optimal MRI images of cutaneous lesions. \nDementing illness: the patient, caregiver and community. Care of the elderly patient with dementing illness involves not only the patient but also the family and other caregivers, and the community. An evaluation and treatment plan must go beyond the patient's immediate medical problems to examine the caregiver's needs and the community services available. \nComparison of the electrical properties of arterial smooth muscle in normotensive rats and rats with deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-induced hypertension: possible involvement of (Na(+)-K(+)-Cl-) co-transport. 1. Hypertension was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by left unilateral nephrectomy and deoxycorticosterone acetate--salt administration. After 5 weeks, arterial systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated in these animals (191.5 +/- 6.0 mmHg, mean +/- SD, n = 17) compared with age-matched, unoperated control animals (134.0 +/- 4.2 mmHg, n = 8, P less than 0.001). 2. The membrane potential of femoral artery vascular smooth muscle measured in vitro was -55.1 +/- 6.3 mV (mean +/- SD, n = 154) for normotensive and -50.8 +/- 5.7 mV (n = 82) for hypertensive animals. The difference in membrane potential was significant (P less than 0.001). 3. The relationship between the log of the extracellular K+ concentration and membrane potential was nonlinear over the extracellular K+ concentration range 2.5-20 mmol/l, and showed a small positive shift with hypertension. 4. Tenfold reductions in the extracellular concentrations of Na+ or Cl- resulted in a membrane potential hyperpolarization in vascular smooth muscle from normotensive animals (4.9 +/- 2.0 mV, n = 13 and 12.1 +/- 1.3 mV, mean +/- SD, n = 14, respectively). In vascular smooth muscle from hypertensive animals, the hyperpolarization in low-Na+ media was significantly increased to 12.2 +/- 2.6 mV (mean +/- SD, n = 5), but that in low-Cl- media was unaffected (2.7 +/- 1.6 mV, n = 6). 5. The loop diuretic, bumetanide (10 mumol/l), hyperpolarized the membrane potential in vascular smooth muscle from both normotensive and hypertensive rats, but not in low-Na+ or low-Cl- media. \nAntigen-presenting cells in essential fatty acid-deficient murine epidermis: keratinocytes bearing class II (Ia) antigens may potentiate the accessory cell function of Langerhans cells. Essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) is a useful model for studying the role of (n-6) fatty acid metabolism in normal physiology. Because cutaneous manifestations are among the earliest signs of EFAD and because abnormalities in the distribution and function of tissue macrophages have been documented in EFAD rodents, we studied the distribution and function of Class II MHC (Ia) antigen-bearing cells in EFAD C57B1/6 mouse epidermis. Immunofluorescence studies revealed 1.9-9.6 (mean +/- SEM = 5.2 +/- 2.6) times more class II MHC (Ia) antigen-bearing epidermal cells in suspensions prepared from EFAD as compared to normal skin. Analysis of epidermal sheets demonstrated similar numbers of dendritic Ia+ and NLDC145+ cells in EFAD and normal epidermis, however. This discrepancy occurred because some keratinocytes in EFAD epidermal sheets expressed class II MHC (Ia) antigens, whereas keratinocytes in normal mouse epidermis did not. Two-color flow cytometry confirmed that all Ia+ cells in normal epidermis are Langerhans (Ia+ NLDC145+) cells, whereas Ia+ cells in EFAD epidermis are comprised of Langerhans cells and a subpopulation of keratinocytes (Ia+ NLDC145-). Similar levels of Ia antigens were expressed on EFAD and normal Langerhans cells. EFAD and normal epidermal cells were also compared in several in vitro assays of accessory cell function. Epidermal cells prepared from EFAD C57B1/6 mice present the protein antigen DNP-Ova to primed helper T cells more effectively than epidermal cells prepared from normal animals. EFAD epidermal cells are also more potent stimulators of T cells in primary and secondary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte-epidermal cell reactions than normal epidermal cells. The functional differences between EFAD and normal epidermal cells do not appear to result from increased cytokine release or decreased prostaglandin production by EFAD epidermal cells. In view of these findings and the observation that the antigen-presenting cell activity of EFAD epidermal cells correlates with the number of Ia+ keratinocytes in epidermal cell preparations, Ia+ keratinocytes (in the presence of Langerhans cells) may potentiate cutaneous immune responses in vitro and perhaps in vivo as well. These results also suggest that (n-6) fatty acids or metabolites of (n-6) fatty acids are involved in regulating the expression of class II MHC (Ia) antigens by keratinocytes in vivo. \nBilateral sequential lung transplantation: the procedure of choice for double-lung replacement. We recently described a technique for bilateral sequential lung transplantation that replaces the en bloc double-lung operation, a procedure that was accompanied by frequent problems with airway healing. Twenty-seven patients have undergone 28 bilateral sequential lung transplantations over the past 14 months. Eighteen patients had transplantation because of end-stage emphysema; 6, cystic fibrosis; and 1 each, obliterative bronchiolitis, usual interstitial pneumonitis with pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. Cardiopulmonary bypass was used electively in the first 5 patients until it was recognized that the procedure could be done safely without it, and in only 3 additional recipients has it been employed. Mean ischemic time for the first lung was 276 +/- 43 minutes and for the second lung, 410 +/- 64 minutes. There have been five deaths, three in the postoperative period (11% operative mortality) and two late. The other patients are alive and well and do not require oxygen 2 to 15 months after transplantation. Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second rose from 16% +/- 8% of predicted to 84% +/- 17% at 12 weeks. Six-minute walk values increased from a mean of 251 +/- 91 m to 666 +/- 42 m at 24 weeks. The excellent exposure afforded to both hemithoraces by the thoracosternotomy incision and the rare need of cardiopulmonary bypass have allowed us to offer the option of transplantation to patients who formerly would have been turned down because of previous pulmonary resection or pleurectomy. On four occasions, ventilator-dependent patients underwent successful transplantation. \nMicrovessel derived endothelial cell isolation, adherence, and monolayer formation for vascular grafts. MVECs can be isolated from animal and human fat in quantities and in a pure enough form to produce a cell-lined vascular graft. In animal studies grafts treated with these cells are associated with prolongation of graft patency. In human implants definitive expression factor VIII related antigen cells has been performed on an MVEC treated graft at 9 months. Further studies will be necessary to provide further insight into the healing and long-term behavior of these grafts, both with respect to the thrombogenicity of the surface as well as the influence on anastomotic hyperplasia. \nStroke in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The thrombosis in myocardial infarction clinical trial and a review of placebo-controlled trials. The frequency of stroke among patients in six recent placebo-controlled trials of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction is reviewed. Three trials used streptokinase and three used tissue plasminogen activator as the thrombolytic agent. While thrombolytic therapy greatly reduces the morbidity and mortality of acute myocardial infarction, it increases the rate of intracerebral hemorrhage. \nPerinatal hepatitis B virus infection caused by antihepatitis Be positive maternal mononuclear cells. To investigate the infectivity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from mothers to their newborn offspring, HBV-DNA in plasma and peripheral mononuclear cells from 28 antihepatitis Be positive, hepatitis B surface antigen positive carrier mothers was examined by a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction/Southern hybridisation technique. HBV specific DNA was detected in three maternal mononuclear cell samples, but was absent in plasma. Two of four infants born to the three mothers with HBV-DNA positive mononuclear cells developed acute or fulminant hepatitis within three months after birth. Two infants were effectively prevented from infection with HBV by combined hepatitis B immunoglobulin/HBV vaccine administration. The 25 infants born to the HBV-DNA negative mothers were free of HBV infection within the next seven months to 3.5 years. These results suggest that latent infection with HBV in maternal mononuclear cells is responsible for perinatal HBV infection. \nAngiographically assessed coronary arterial patency and reocclusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with anistreplase: results of the anistreplase reocclusion multicenter study (ARMS). In this open multicenter study, 156 patients with acute myocardial infarction received 30 U of anistreplase intravenously over 5 minutes within 4 hours of the onset of chest pain. The patency of the infarct-related vessel was determined by coronary angiography 90 minutes after anistreplase treatment, and also 24 hours after treatment, in patients with a patent infarct-related vessel at 90 minutes, to assess the reocclusion rate. The investigators categorized the infarct-related vessel as patent or occluded, and 2 independent cardiologists graded the infarct-related vessel according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) perfusion criteria. At the 90-minute assessment, 106 of 145 evaluable patients (73%) had patent infarct-related vessels, and 39 of 145 (27%) had occluded infarct-related vessels. Of the 139 independently assessed patients, 98 (71%) had TIMI grades 2 or 3 and 41 (29%) had TIMI grades 0 or 1. At the 24-hour assessment, 98 of 102 patients (96%) had a patent infarct-related vessel, and reocclusion had occurred in 4 of 102 patients (4%). Of the 94 independently assessed patients 90 (96%) had TIMI grades 2 or 3, and 4 (4%) had TIMI grades 0 or 1. The reliability of noninvasive parameters as indicators of achieved patency of the infarct-related vessel was estimated by means of correlation with patency assessed by coronary angiography. A significant correlation of 0.62 was found. The patency rate of 71 to 73% after use of anistreplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction corresponds with findings in earlier studies. The low reocclusion rate of 4% after use of anistreplase probably reflects the prolonged action of anistreplase. \nAngiographic vasospasm and release of platelet thromboxane after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We studied adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and the associated release of thromboxane B2 in 49 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage in relation to angiographic vasospasm. Postoperative cerebral angiography was performed less than or equal to 3 (median 1) days after surgery for an aneurysm 5-14 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Correspondingly, one sample from each patient was taken within 24 hours either before or after angiography. The occurrence of severe as well as diffuse, moderate, or severe angiographic vasospasm was associated with the presence of delayed cerebral ischemia (p less than 0.05). Patients with diffuse angiographic vasospasm had significantly higher (p less than 0.05) values for thromboxane B2 release than the others, even after adjustment by the clinical grades on admission and before surgery, the timing of surgery, the time from subarachnoid hemorrhage to angiography and blood sampling, and nimodipine therapy. Severe and diffuse angiographic vasospasm were also associated with poor outcome at 1 year (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that augmented release of platelet thromboxane may be involved in the pathogenesis of vasospasm in large cerebral arteries. \nHerpes simplex virus DNA in occult lesions: demonstration by the polymerase chain reaction. Herpes simplex virus DNA was identified by the polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for the herpes DNA polymerase gene. A herpes-specific amplimer was detected in two of three cases in which the clinical and histologic features were inconclusive. \nThe present status of akathisia. Akathisia is a common and distressing side effect of antipsychotic and some other psychotropic medications. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of its clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment. Restless legs syndrome and akathisia associated with Parkinson's disease are discussed in so far as they help understand drug-induced akathisia. The complexity of the disorder, and the difficulty in characterizing and quantifying it, may explain why researchers have relatively neglected akathisia for so long. The recent upsurge of research interest promises the hope of a better understanding of its pathophysiology so that effective therapy may result. \nVideofluoroscopy in elderly patients with aspiration: importance of evaluating both oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition. Oropharyngeal functional impairment increases with age so that radiologists frequently are asked to determine the cause of aspiration in elderly patients. Neuromuscular and cognitive impairment often make it difficult to perform and interpret videofluoroscopic deglutition examinations in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed the barium swallow examinations in 50 elderly patients (mean age, 87 years) who were known to aspirate. We looked for specific patterns of oropharyngeal dysfunction that resulted in bolus misdirection. Analysis revealed that aspiration was due to abnormalities of the oral stage in 23, pharyngeal stage in 10, and both stages in 17. Dysfunction in the oral stage was due to ingestion of large volumes or rapid acquisition rates in nine, failure of containment during processing (bolus manipulation) in 18, and dissociation of lingual delivery and swallowing initiation in the transitional phase in 13. Dysfunction in the pharyngeal stage was due to incomplete transport (bolus retention) in 21 and defective closure of the laryngeal vestibule in 11. No significant relationship between conditions known to cause oropharyngeal dysfunction (dementia, stroke, Parkinson disease, disuse deconditioning) and the specific pattern of dysfunction was identified. These results indicate that an accurate and valid assessment of oropharyngeal dysfunction in elderly patients with aspiration is possible if specific patterns of dysfunction are sought. Our study indicates the importance of evaluating the oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition in elderly patients who aspirate. \nRole of basic fibroblast growth factor in revascularization of rabbit tracheal autografts. Despite omentopexy of the bronchial anastomosis, donor airway ischemia remains a problem after lung transplantation. This study examined the hypothesis that surface abrasion and topical application of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) would enhance omental revascularization of trachea in a rabbit heterotopic autograft model. Tracheal segments were excised, primary tracheal anastomoses performed, and the segments placed in the peritoneal cavity wrapped in omentum. Animals were randomized to one of six groups according to tracheal segment treatment: control, surgical abrasion, Surgicel wrap with topical bFGF, Surgicel wrap with bFGF vehicle, Gelfoam wrap with bFGF, and topical bFGF alone. One week later, animals were heparinized, perfused with Aquablak dye, and killed. Tracheal segments were excised and sectioned for light microscopic quantitative assessment of viability and dye perfusion. There was no significant improvement in viability or perfusion between abraded tracheal segments or segments treated with bFGF/Gelfoam or bFGF alone when compared with control segments. Airways wrapped in Surgicel had significantly greater ischemic injury compared with the control group, regardless of bFGF application. Neither surgical abrasion nor topical bFGF increased omental revascularization of transplanted tracheal segments after 7 days. \nVentricular cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia in children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. To determine the significance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) eosinophilia, the charts of 106 patients treated with shunt-related procedures during the calendar year 1985 were reviewed. Sixty-nine patients presented for a shunt revision; their charts were retrospectively reviewed from the time of shunt insertion until January, 1988. The remaining 37 patients had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted during the study period and were subsequently followed to January, 1988. A total of 558 shunt-related procedures were performed on these patients during the study period, with a mean follow-up period of 6.9 years. The infection rate was 3.8%. Eosinophilia was diagnosed when eosinophils accounted for 8% or more of the total CSF white blood cell count. Ventricular CSF eosinophilia occurred in 36 patients sometime during their clinical course. These 36 patients required a mean of 8.5 shunt revisions, while the remaining patients required a mean of 2.5 revisions (p less than 0.001). Shunt infections were also more frequent in patients with eosinophilia (p less than 0.01). In no case was peripheral eosinophilia or a parasitic infection present. This study demonstrates that CSF eosinophilia is common in children with shunts. Children with this laboratory finding will experience more shunt failures. In addition, the new appearance of eosinophilia in the CSF of a patient with a shunt in place suggests the possibility of a shunt infection. \nTransfer of genetic epilepsy by embryonic brain grafts in the chicken. In the Fayoumi chicken, a spontaneous recessive autosomal mutation (F.Epi) is responsible for high susceptibility to seizures that are especially inducible by intermittent light stimulation. Substitution of defined areas of the encephalic neuroepithelium in normal chicken embryos at 2 days of incubation by their counterparts from homozygous F.Epi embryos generates the epileptic phenotype in the chimeras. It was found that grafting primordia of both prosencephalon and mesencephalon of homozygous F.Epi birds is necessary and sufficient for transfer of the full disease. When grafted alone, the homozygous F.Epi prosencephalon, although showing the typical epileptic interictal electroencephalogram, does not allow the complete epileptic seizures to occur in the hosts. Grafts of mesencephalon and/or rhombencephalon modify neither the behavior nor the electroencephalographic pattern of the recipient chickens. Cooperation of forebrain and midbrain activities is therefore required to yield epileptic seizures in this model. \nVascular complications of cardiac catheterization. Femoral artery injury after diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization is a frequently encountered clinical problem. This study reviews 150 femoral artery injuries that occurred in 16,350 patients over a 5-year period. A prospective computerized cardiac catheterization data bank was used to determine significant risk factors associated with the occurrence of vascular injury. Logistic regression analysis revealed that congestive heart failure, female gender, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or valvuloplasty procedure were significantly associated with occurrence of vascular injury. Greater age, smaller body surface area, and smaller weight were also associated with injury. Recommendations for management include an aggressive approach to obstruction even if local vascular reconstruction is required. False aneurysms are studied by ultrasonography, and small ones may be observed expectantly. Larger aneurysms and aneurysms that persist beyond a few days are managed by use of general or regional anesthesia and by gaining proximal control of the iliac artery. Arteriovenous fistulas resulting from catheterization are rarely hemodynamically significant and often close spontaneously. Thus repair should be delayed. \nStudy of the seminal vesicles in acute epididymitis. Although it has been suggested that seminal vesiculitis is present in patients with epididymitis, it has not been proven. We performed rectal ultrasound assessment of the seminal vesicles in 18 consecutive patients with epididymitis. The seminal vesicles on the same side as the epididymitis was significantly enlarged in 75% of cases; 92% of these enlarged vesicles returned to normal size in 12 weeks. A persistently enlarged seminal vesicle was associated with unresolved epididymitis, and further bacteriological studies in these cases demonstrated continued Chlamydia infection in some patients over 35 years of age. \nCost-effectiveness of hepatitis B screening in a mental health institution. In 1982, the Ohio Department of Health Screening established guidelines for hepatitis B screening and vaccination for intermediate mental health care facilities. The present study was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these guidelines. Data from an intermediate mental health care institution in Champaign/Urbana, Illinois, were used. The analysis considered the direct costs and benefits accrued over a 3-year period and a range of transmission rates. At a 3-year transmission rate of 0.030, the screening and vaccination policy cost $7300 per case of hepatitis B avoided (or $345,800 per hepatitis B fatality avoided). At a more likely 3-year transmission rate of 0.271, the screening and vaccination policy cost $300 per case of hepatitis B avoided (or $12,100 per hepatitis B fatality avoided). Either way, the active prevention policy compares very well with the amounts of money spent by the US Government on other life-saving programs. A general cost-effectiveness model is given that can be adapted for institution-specific analyses at other mental health care facilities. \nIs the pressure rate quotient a predictor or indicator of myocardial ischemia as measured by ST-segment changes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery? Perioperative myocardial ischemia is associated with an increased risk of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI). Several attempts have been made to define intraoperative hemodynamic predictors of myocardial ischemia. In a canine preparation with coronary stenosis, a pressure rate quotient (PRQ = mean arterial pressure/heart rate) less than one (PRQ less than 1) indicated subendocardial myocardial ischemia. The authors tested this hypothesis in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG), using electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-segment changes (leads II/V5) to diagnose myocardial ischemia. Sixty (n = 60) patients having CABG surgery were prospectively studied before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Calibrated ECG leads II and V5 (diagnostic mode) were monitored continuously and recorded with the use of a Hewlett-Packard computer ST-segment analyzer. In addition, arterial and pulmonary artery pressures were monitored. Ischemia was defined as new-onset ST deviation (greater than or equal to 1 mm from the baseline ECG). ECG and hemodynamic data were stored at 2-min intervals for subsequent computer analysis. Serial creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) X MB (%) determinations and 12-lead ECGs were collected for the initial 3 postoperative days. Of the 3,463 intervals (2 min) available for study, 3,322 (96%) were satisfactorily recorded for 60 patients. Ischemia occurred during 65 intervals in 9 patients (9 of 60), of which only 34% (22 of 65) were associated with a PRQ less than 1 (P less than 0.01). In contrast, there were 466 intervals during which PRQ was less than 1, but without ECG evidence of ischemia. \nAn evaluation of multiple clinical variables for hypoxia during colonoscopy. One hundred consecutive patients undergoing routine colonoscopy were evaluated for changes in arterial oxygen saturation levels. All of the patients were monitored with the Nellcor N-200 pulse oximeter (Nellcor Incorporated) by finger probe and received supplemental oxygen when SaO2 levels decreased below 90 per cent. Forty patients demonstrated a decrease in SaO2 to less than 90 per cent after intravenous sedation but prior to colonoscopy, 14 patients demonstrated a decrease in SaO2 to less than 90 per cent during colonoscopy, and 46 patients maintained SaO2 levels greater than 90 per cent at all times. No statistical differences were found when these three groups were compared for age, body surface area, drug dosage, smoking history and a history of pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, arrhythmias, angina or myocardial infarction and pulmonary disease. These data indicate that all patients undergoing colonoscopy should be placed on supplemental oxygen. We further recommend continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring when available. \nSolvent-associated olfactory dysfunction: not a predictor of deficits in learning and memory. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate associations between olfactory dysfunction and aberrations in learning and memory after chronic occupational exposure to mixed hydrocarbon solvents. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional, epidemiologic study of 187 paint manufacturing workers. The authors administered quantitative tests of olfactory function (the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) and neurobehavioral function (eight computer- and examiner-administered tests of learning and memory) to workers for whom detailed information was available on lifetime occupational exposure to solvents. RESULTS: Olfactory function test scores were positively correlated with performance on seven of eight of the tests of learning and memory in bivariate analyses. After adjustment for important confounding variables (i.e., age, vocabulary score, and cumulative exposure to hydrocarbon solvents) with multiple linear regression, olfactory function scores predicted performance only on the Wechsler Memory Scale Delayed Logical Memory test. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the data did not reveal that olfactory dysfunction was correlated with decrements in various memory functions. \nDysplastic nevi as risk markers of sporadic (nonfamilial) melanoma. A case-control study. The melanoma risk associated with dysplastic nevi outside the context of familial melanoma was studied by the case-control method. One hundred five newly diagnosed incident melanoma cases with negative family histories for familial melanoma and 181 controls (frequency matched for race, age, and sex) were studied by personal interview and cutaneous examination. The prevalence of dysplastic nevi was 41 (39%) of 105 in the cases and 13 (7%) of 181 in the controls. The odds ratio for dysplastic nevi by multiple logistic regression analysis simultaneously correcting for age, sex, eye color, hair color, actinic damage, freckles, and total number of nondysplastic nevi was 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.7, 16.9). This study supports the significance of dysplastic nevi as markers of increased risk for nonfamilial melanoma. \nExperience in the surgical treatment of 331 patients with pulmonary hydatidosis. Echinococcus disease is prevalent in Chile, with a rate of occurrence of 8.2 per 100,000. During a 15-year-period (1970 to 1985) we operated on 331 patients for pulmonary hydatidosis. Chest roentgenography was the main method of diagnosis. Among the total of 508 surgical procedures performed, pulmonary cystectomy was the most common (61.4%), whereas pulmonary resection was used in 31.4% of patients. The arc 5 test was used to confirm the diagnosis. Results were positive in 85% of the patients in whom it was done. There were 12.9% immediate postoperative complications in 12.9%, with late complications occurring in 4.10% and an overall mortality rate of 4.21%. These data suggest that hydatid cyst is still a common disease in our country, causing an important number of hospital admissions and a high percentage of complications. \nDevine exclusion for unresectable carcinoma of the stomach. Between July 1986 and July 1988, Devine exclusion was performed in 20 patients with unresectable carcinoma of the gastric antrum. All 20 patients presented with repeated vomiting. On endoscopy, 16 patients had complete gastric outlet obstruction while the remainder manifested significant gastric outlet stenosis. There was no hospital mortality. All except two patients could take an oral diet after surgery until their demise. Devine exclusion is safe and effective in relieving gastric outlet obstruction and is not associated with prolonged delay in return of gastric emptying. \nNeurologic disorders and dermatologic manifestations in HIV-infected children. Cutaneous manifestations of HIV infections in childhood are common but are not the dermatologic lesions associated with HIV infection in adults. For example, Kaposi's sarcoma, a common finding in adults with AIDS, is rare in children. Other cutaneous manifestations, including bacterial and fungal lesions and viral exanthems, are common in children with AIDS and can be atypical and severe. Because 90% of the pediatric AIDS population acquires the virus via maternal transmission to the fetus, a dysmorphic syndrome associated with intrauterine infection has been described. Physicians caring for and evaluating pediatric patients at risk for AIDS should be aware of these dermatologic manifestations, so that early detection and treatment can be instituted to reduce the morbidity of the complication of HIV infection. \nDouble-outlet right ventricle: morphologic demonstration using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Sixteen patients with double-outlet right ventricle, aged 1 week to 29 years (median 5 months), were studied with a 1.5 tesla nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging scanner. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in all patients. Thirteen patients underwent angiography, including nine who underwent subsequent surgical correction. Three patients underwent postmortem examination. Small children and infants were scanned inside a 32 cm diameter proton head coil. Multiple 5 mm thick sections separated by 0.5 mm and gated to the patient's electrocardiogram were acquired with a spin-echo sequence and an echo time of 30 ms. A combination of standard and oblique imaging planes was used. Imaging times were less than 90 min. The NMR images were technically unsuitable in one patient because of excessive motion artifact. In the remaining patients, the diagnosis of double outlet right ventricle was confirmed and correlated with surgical and postmortem findings. The NMR images were particularly valuable in demonstrating the interrelations between the great arteries and the anatomy of the outlet septum and the spatial relations between the ventricular septal defect and the great arteries. Although the atrioventricular (AV) valves were not consistently demonstrated, NMR imaging in two patients identified abnormalities of the mitral valve that were not seen with two-dimensional echocardiography. In one patient who had a superoinferior arrangement of the ventricles, NMR imaging was the most useful imaging technique for demonstrating the anatomy. In patients with double-outlet right ventricle, NMR imaging can provide clinically relevant and accurate morphologic information that may contribute to future improvement in patient management. \nNerve growth factor rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 by a kinase activity associated with the product of the trk protooncogene. Nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes the survival and differentiation of specific populations of neurons. The molecular mechanisms by which cells respond to NGF are poorly understood, but two clues have emerged recently. First, NGF rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of several unidentified proteins in the NGF-responsive pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 [Maher, P. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 6788-6791]. Second, the protein-tyrosine kinase encoded by the protooncogene trk (p140trk), a member of the receptor class of tyrosine kinases, becomes activated and phosphorylated on tyrosine after NGF treatment of PC12 cells [Kaplan, D. R., Martin-Zanca, D. & Parada, L. F. (1991) Nature (London) 350, 158-160]. We now report that NGF rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1), and we present evidence that the responsible tyrosine kinase is either p140trk or a closely associated protein. Treatment of responsive cells with NGF elicited phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 on tyrosine and serine. PLC-gamma 1 immunoprecipitated from NGF-stimulated cells was phosphorylated in vitro by coprecipitating protein kinase activity, and the phosphorylations occurred principally on tyrosine. The responsible kinase could be depleted from cellular lysates by antibodies specific for p140trk. This procedure also depleted a 140-kDa protein that normally coprecipitated with PLC-gamma 1 and became phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo in response to NGF. Analysis of tryptic peptides from PLC-gamma 1 indicated that the residues phosphorylated in vitro by p140trk-associated kinase activity were largely congruent with those phosphorylated in vivo after NGF treatment. Our findings identify PLC-gamma 1 as a likely substrate for the trk-encoded tyrosine kinase, and they provide a link between NGF-dependent activation of p140trk and the stimulation of intracellular second messenger pathways. \nGenetic basis for p53 overexpression in human breast cancer. Overexpression of an activated form of the p53 protein may be involved in neoplastic transformation. We found widespread overexpression of p53 by immunohistochemical staining in 11 (22%) of 49 primary invasive human breast cancers. Northern blot analysis showed that this overexpression was not due to an increase in the steady-state level of p53 mRNA. The p53 gene was directly sequenced in 7 of these tumors with elevated levels of the protein and, in each case, a mutation that altered the coding sequence for p53 was found in a highly conserved region of the gene. Whereas 4 of these tumors contained only a mutant p53 allele, the other 3 tumors exhibited coding sequences from both a mutant and a wild-type allele. p53 mutations have previously been correlated with allelic loss of part of chromosome 17p that contains the p53 locus. Examination of all 49 breast tumors revealed a 61% frequency of deletion at or near the p53 locus. However, the presence of allelic deletion did not correlate with overexpression of the protein. Six tumors that were deleted but did not express high levels of the protein were sequenced and all retained a wild-type p53 allele. In this series of human breast cancers, overexpression of the p53 protein, not allelic loss on chromosome 17p, was always associated with mutation of the p53 gene. \nLong-term follow-up after sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: Causes, pump failure, and empiric antiarrhythmic therapy that modify survival. We analyzed the actuarial cardiac mortality rate of 295 consecutive patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia who were referred to us between 1978 and 1988. Patients were divided into four groups: group I of 156 patients with coronary disease, group II of 55 patients with nonischemic left ventricular disease, group III of 65 patients with right ventricular disease, and group IV of 19 patients without detectable heart disease. Patients were treated empirically according to a prospective schema: (1) class I antiarrhythmic drugs, (2) in case of recurrence of ventricular tachycardia: amiodarone or beta-blockers, (3) in case of recurrence of ventricular tachycardia: drug combinations or surgery. The mean follow-up duration was 61 +/- 40 months after the first occurrence of ventricular tachycardia, and the clinical outcome was known in 67.5% of patients at 5 years. The actuarial mortality rates were considerably higher in groups I and II compared with those in groups III and IV (p less than 0.01). The mortality rate was slightly higher in group I than in group II (p less than 0.05). In groups I and II, actuarial mortality rate were much higher when left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 0.30 (p less than 0.01). Comparisons between treatments showed no difference in actuarial mortality rates in patients with ventricular tachycardia and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 0.30. \nWT1 mutations contribute to abnormal genital system development and hereditary Wilms' tumour. Wilms' tumour (WT), aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities and mental retardation form a symptom group (WAGR syndrome) associated with hemizygous deletions of DNA in chromosome band 11p13 (refs 1,2). However, it has not been clear whether hemizygosity at a single locus contributes to more than one phenotype. The tumour suppressor gene for Wilms' tumour, WT1, has been characterized: it is expressed at high levels in the glomeruli of the kidney, as well as the gonadal ridge of the developing gonad, the Sertoli cells of the testis and the epithelial and granulosa cells of the ovary, suggesting a developmental role in the genital system in addition to the kidney. We now report constitutional mutations within the WT1 genes of two individuals with a combination of WT and genital abnormalities as evidence of a role for a recessive oncogene in mammalian development. \nTreatment of acute myeloid leukaemia in a renal allograft recipient: implications of cyclosporin immunosuppressive treatment. The clinical effects of cyclosporin were evaluated during cytotoxic treatment in a 61 year old man with acute myeloid leukaemia. He had required a renal transplant 18 months before presenting with acute myeloid leukaemia (FAB subtype M4). He had received cyclosporin 3.5-4.0 mg/kg daily to maintain a plasma cyclosporin concentration of 75-150 ng/ml. Cyclosporin was continued during induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin, cytarabine, and 6-thioguanine (DAT). He had fever and oropharyngeal candidiasis that was unresponsive to anti-bacterial drugs but responsive to systemic amphotericin. Bone marrow examination 14 days after chemotherapy showed complete haematological remission. Subsequently he tolerated consolidation treatment with DAT with no serious complications. Unfortunately he developed fatal septicaemia following a second consolidation with mitozantrone and cytarabine. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity by cyclosporin may not significantly increase the toxicity of aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens, and as benefit may be achieved by this approach further clinical evaluation is justified. \nThe detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HBsAG negative individuals with primary liver cancer. The importance of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the development of primary liver cancer has been established by epidemiological studies. However, the evidence for a direct role of the virus in liver carcinogenesis is still tentative. In addition, the findings of HBV DNA sequences in HBsAg-negative subjects with liver cancer has been reported, although it is controversial. Here we report the use of the polymerase chain reaction to detect HBV DNA in the serum and liver of HBsAg-negative patients. This technique allows both for the detection and cloning of HBV variants. In addition, the demonstration of HBV DNA and RNA molecules in HCC of HBsAg-negative individuals as determined by standard techniques reinforces the role of HBV in the pathogenesis of this tumor. \nMycotic aortic aneurysm infected by Clostridium septicum--a case history. The authors describe a sixty-seven-year-old hypertensive, diabetic man with a mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm infected with Clostridium septicum. The patient had colonic polyps but no malignant disease. They could find only one other report of a mycotic aneurysm infected with C. septicum. In that case, as in most other cases of C. septicum bacteremia, the patient had gastrointestinal cancer. Their case suggests that treatment for a clostridial infection should be considered in patients with known gastrointestinal disease, signs and symptoms of sepsis, and abdominal pain. Conversely, patients known to have a C. septicum infection should be evaluated for gastrointestinal lesions. \nHormonal and local factors in hypertension. The cause of primary (essential) hypertension remains unknown, but a number of circulating hormones and endothelium-derived factors are probably involved. This review summarizes recent evidence on the roles of hyperinsulinemia, the renin-angiotensin system, atrial natriuretic factor, and three endothelium-derived factors--prostacyclin, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and endothelin. \nCauda equina compression associated with breast cancer. A case study in differential diagnosis. The determination of the etiology of spinal cord compression in cancer patients is essential for appropriate therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are not immune to the development of superimposed nonmalignant disease. Although metastatic epidural compression may occur in up to 9% of breast cancer patients, care must be taken to rule out other nonmetastatic lesions causing compression. The association of concurrent breast carcinoma and a spinal neurilemoma simulating a metastatic lesion seems not to have been previously reported. A neurilemoma was observed in a 50-year-old woman. A neurilemoma suspected to be a metastatic lesion may produce the clinical features of pain, neurologic deficit, and weakness. Differentiation will be aided by roentgenograms, radionuclide bone scans, computed tomography, and possible magnetic resonance imaging. Radiologic differentiation hinges on the recognition and the slow-growing nature and noninvasive boundaries of the nonmalignant lesion. Ultimate verification is by biopsy. Treatment should consist of neurectomy, if severely symptomatic, and stabilization as indicated. \nInvasive cervical carcinoma: MR imaging after preoperative chemotherapy. To evaluate assessment of tumor regression with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the authors studied 21 consecutive patients with cervical carcinoma tumors that were more than 3 cm in diameter. Thirteen of the 21 also demonstrated parametrial invasion. In all cases, MR imaging was performed both before and after chemotherapy. Pathologic specimens were obtained at hysterectomy in all patients. Comparison of pathologic and MR imaging findings after chemotherapy showed that all tumors decreased in size. Size of tumor was correctly determined at MR in 17 cases and was slightly overestimated in four cases. Five patients had residual parametrial invasion that was histologically confirmed. In detecting parametrial spread after treatment, MR imaging had an accuracy of 90.4%. Tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, whereas intratumoral necrosis was characterized by low signal intensity on the same images. Peritumoral inflammatory tissue found at pathologic examination in four of 21 cases was not specifically identified on MR images. In patients with invasive cervical carcinoma, MR imaging may be useful in evaluating tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy. \nHeterotopic heart transplantation and native heart ventricular arrhythmias. Heterotopic heart transplantation has been said to be contraindicated in patients with serious native heart arrhythmias that produce hemodynamic instability. Placement of heterotopic allografts, however, can theoretically act as a biological biventricular assist device to provide hemodynamic support during these unstable rhythms. Further, this operation might beneficially alter the hemodynamic milieu of heart failure such that the arrhythmias are ameliorated. Described is our experience with 4 patients with heart failure receiving heterotopic cardiac allografts, documenting changes in native heart arrhythmia that occurred. These cases demonstrate that heterotopic grafts can adequately sustain hemodynamics during malignant native heart dysrhythmia. We believe native heart ventricular arrhythmias are not a contraindication to heterotopic heart transplantation. \nCalves as a source of an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis among young children in an agricultural closed community. Transmission of Cryptosporidium from animals to humans, originating mainly in calves, had been suggested previously but has remained unproved. An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis that started among calves was transmitted to multiple pediatric groups living in close contact through one family who had close contact with the calves. Eleven of 19 (58%) infants and young children ages 10 to 15 months had Cryptosporidium compared with 3 of 27 (11%) of those ages 36 to 60 months and none of those ages 16 to 35 months. None of the asymptomatic children was positive for Cryptosporidium. These data emphasize that an extensive human to human transmission does not rule out the zoonotic nature of cryptosporidiosis. \nHereditary coproporphyria: an imitator of multiple sclerosis. Hereditary coproporphyria can cause both peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system abnormalities. There are several similarities between multiple sclerosis and hereditary coproporphyria that are probably due to the central nervous system dysfunction present in both. This report describes a 62-year-old man with a five-year history of progressive paraparesis initially diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. Supporting evidence for the diagnosis of a demyelinating disease included three oligoclonal bands in the patient's cerebral spinal fluid, a prolonged visual evoked response bilaterally, abnormal sensory evoked potentials, and an area of increased signal in the posterior cervical cord suggestive of demyelination that was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Features atypical for multiple sclerosis were hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes, electromyographic evidence of peripheral neuropathy, and severe constipation. Elevated urine porphyrins and decreased levels of coproporphyrinogen oxidase confirmed the correct diagnosis of hereditary coproporphyria. The patient improved after being placed on a high-carbohydrate diet. Although central demyelination is known to occur in patients with porphyria, delayed evoked potentials and MRI abnormalities have not been previously reported. \nClofazimine: a review of its use in leprosy and Mycobacterium avium complex infection. This article reviews the chemistry, pharmacology, spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy in leprosy and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, adverse effects, drug interactions, and special considerations of clofazimine. The drug is active in vivo against M. leprae and in vitro against MAC. In addition, it possesses antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Clinical studies support the efficacy of clofazimine as a part of multidrug therapy in treating leprosy. It also appears to reduce the incidence and severity of erythema nodosum leprosum reactions that often occur during the treatment of leprosy. Efficacy in treating MAC infection in patients with AIDS is not well documented, despite the use of clofazimine in combination with other agents. A few patients have responded symptomatically and by clearing their mycobacteremia, although there is no evidence that mortality is reduced. Clofazimine is well tolerated, at least when doses less than or equal to 100 mg/d are used. Adverse reactions include discoloration of the skin, self-limiting gastrointestinal intolerance, severe and life-threatening abdominal pain and organ damage due to clofazimine crystal deposition, and asymptomatic discoloration of the eye. Clofazimine should be considered for formulary inclusion. \nIntraoperative radiotherapy of skull base cancer. As the head and neck surgeon expands the boundaries of resectability into the skull base, the margin of tumor clearance diminishes. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) can be used as an adjunct to skull base surgery and external beam radiation to enhance local control in areas with close margins or remaining microscopic disease. During the period from May 1982 to May 1988, 25 patients underwent IORT of the skull base following resection and prior to closure to treat microscopic disease in 9 patients, sterilize close margins in 14 patients, and attempt to eliminate remaining gross disease in 2 patients. The types of tumors treated were 13 squamous cell carcinomas, 4 adenoid cystic carcinomas, 3 high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas, 3 sarcomas, 1 malignant mixed tumor, and an oncocytic adenocarcinoma. The majority of the tumors either originated in the sinuses or were skull base extensions of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancers. In 22 patients with 1-year follow-up, IORT prevented local recurrence in 14 (64%) patients. This may represent improved control of local disease in patients who historically have a very dismal prognosis. The indications, techniques, and complications of this exciting therapeutic modality are also reviewed. \nPrevention of postoperative renal dysfunction in patients with obstructive jaundice: a multicentre study of bile salts and lactulose. The role of preoperative lactulose and bile salts in the prevention of postoperative renal failure in patients with obstructive jaundice has been evaluated in a prospective randomized trial. One hundred and two patients undergoing surgery for obstructive jaundice (bilirubin greater than 100 mumols/l) were randomized into three groups: those receiving preoperative oral lactulose (n = 35), those receiving oral sodium deoxycholate (n = 32) and a control group of patients receiving no specific treatment (n = 35). All patients received intravenous fluids commencing the night before surgery. One patient in the control group and none in the treatment groups developed postoperative renal failure. Postoperative deterioration of renal function in patients with normal preoperative function was significantly more common in the control group than in the treatment groups (chi 2 = 8.1, d.f. = 2, P less than 0.02). The incidence of renal failure and impairment was lower in this control group than that reported in previous studies. This may be due to the introduction of adequate preoperative hydration. Additional protection occurs by the preoperative administration of either lactulose or sodium deoxycholate. \nNonepileptic events in childhood. The medical records of 27 children admitted to the MINCEP Epilepsy Program for evaluation of intractable epilepsy but later shown to have nonepileptic events by EEG with simultaneous video monitoring were reviewed. Four groups were identified: pure psychogenic events (5 patients), psychogenic events plus epileptic seizures (3 patients), pure nonepileptic physiologic events (5 patients), and nonepileptic physiologic events plus seizures (14 patients). Historical data, physical examinations, and neurodiagnostic evaluations (including previous EEGs, neuroradiologic evaluations, and neuropsychologic testing) were reviewed. Children in all groups, except for those with pure psychogenic seizures, had a history of multiple seizure types identified by parents or caretakers. A history of status epilepticus was obtained in 64% (of 22 patients), including 11 of 14 patients with physiologic events plus seizures. Abnormal findings on neurologic examination were common, especially in children with nonepileptic physiologic events. All but two patients had a history of interictal epileptiform abnormalities on previous routine EEGs. Based on identification of nonepileptic events, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were discontinued completely in eight patients (30%) and the total number of AEDs was reduced in nine others (33%). A diagnosis of nonepileptic events should be considered in all children with refractory seizures or multiple seizure types. Abnormal findings on routine (interictal) EEG may actually confound the diagnosis. Intensive neurodiagnostic EEG-video recording is the preferred method for distinguishing nonepileptic from epileptic seizures. \nCardiovascular effects of bupropion in depressed patients with heart disease. OBJECTIVE: The cardiovascular effects of therapeutic plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants in depressed patients with and without preexisting cardiac disease have been well characterized and include orthostatic hypotension and conduction delay. Bupropion, structurally unrelated to tricyclic antidepressants, is relatively free of cardiac side effects in depressed patients without cardiac disease. However, it is unknown whether bupropion is safe for depressed patients with preexisting heart disease, so the authors studied the cardiovascular effects of bupropion in such patients. METHOD: The subjects were 36 inpatients with DSM-III major depression and preexisting left ventricular impairment (N = 15), ventricular arrhythmias (N = 15), and/or conduction disease (N = 21). The patients continued their cardiac drug regimens and received bupropion for 3 weeks (mean +/- SD dose = 442 +/- 47 mg/day). Cardiovascular functioning was measured by pulse, blood pressure, high-speed ECG, 24-hour portable ECG, and radionuclide angiography. RESULTS: Although bupropion caused a rise in supine blood pressure, it did not cause significant conduction complications, did not exacerbate ventricular arrhythmias, had a low rate of orthostatic hypotension, and had no effect on pulse rate. However, bupropion treatment was discontinued for 14% of the patients because of adverse effects, including exacerbation of baseline hypertension in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular profile of bupropion may make this drug a useful agent in the treatment of the depressed patient with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Further studies, with longer durations of bupropion treatment and more subjects, are needed to confirm these findings. \nHemolytic reactions to nitrofurantoin in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: theory and practice. The prescribing information for nitrofurantoin states that patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may experience hemolysis following administration of the drug. Although there is no doubt that this statement is qualitatively correct, the degree of risk in the general population of patients has not been previously quantified. This study was designed to estimate the degree of risk of a clinically important hemolytic reaction to nitrofurantoin by means of a retrospective analysis of the Norwich Eaton adverse reaction database. Since 1953, approximately 130 million courses of nitrofurantoin therapy have been distributed in the U.S. alone. The database contained 127 reports of hemolytic reactions; a \"worst-case\" estimate of the incidence rate was 1 in 100,000 courses of therapy. Considering the extensive usage of nitrofurantoin, clinically important hemolytic reactions appeared to be very rare. For the cases in which outcome was recorded, complete recovery occurred in 87 percent of patients. Although nitrofurantoin is contraindicated after the onset of labor and in infants less than one month old, no well-documented cases of hemolytic reactions in neonates were identified. \nCurrent issues in the performance of Mohs micrographic surgery. Recently, a survey was sent to all members of the American College of Mohs Micrographic Surgery and Cutaneous Oncology concerning their performance of Mohs micrographic surgery. Responses to numerous questions regarding the daily practice of this technique revealed that many useful modifications have evolved over the years that serve to enhance the efficacy and the efficiency of the original Mohs surgical procedure. The results of this survey are presented and discussed. \nEwing's sarcoma: metastatic tumor to the jaw. Metastatic tumors to the jaw are a rare occurrence. The incidence of metastatic Ewing's sarcoma to the jaw has been reported to be less than 2% of all cases of Ewing's sarcoma. Early detection of such lesions is difficult because the signs and symptoms do not appear until the lesion has progressed considerably. The treatment options are therefore limited to palliative care of the patient rather than cure. This article reports a case of Ewing's sarcoma that had metastasized to the mandible and reviews the literature. \nCause of death in patients attending multiple sclerosis clinics. Between 1972 and 1988, 145 deaths occurred among 3,126 patients attending the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Clinics in Vancouver, British Columbia (N = 1,583), and London, Ontario (N = 1,543). We could determine the exact cause of death in 82.1% of cases (119 of 145). Of the 119 patients for whom the cause of death was known, 56 deaths (47.1%) were directly attributed to complications of MS. Of the remaining 63 deaths, 18 (28.6%) were suicides, 19 (30.2%) were due to malignancy, 13 (20.6%) to an acute myocardial infarction, seven (11.1%) to stroke, and the remainder (9.5%) to miscellaneous causes, of which two may have been suicides. The proportion of suicides among MS deaths was 7.5 times that for the age-matched general population, and the proportion of MS deaths from malignancy was 0.67 times that for the age-matched general population. The proportion of deaths due to malignancy and stroke was the same for the MS patients and the age-matched general population. \nNon-neoplastic pineal cysts. We identified 53 patients with non-neoplastic cysts of the pineal gland. In contrast to patients with pineal neoplasms, pineal cysts are usually asymptomatic. They infrequently obstruct the aqueduct to cause hydrocephalus or compress the tectum to produce the neuro-ophthalmologic signs of dorsal midbrain dysfunction. Obstructive hydrocephalus was present in only five patients (9.4%); three of them showed clinical signs of Parinaud's syndrome. CT and MRI typically reveal a cystic mass that averages 1.6 cm in anteroposterior (A-P) diameter with calcification at the periphery and faint rim-like contrast enhancement. Sagittal MRI is the most useful diagnostic test because it shows the anatomic relationship of the cyst to the aqueduct. The mass may compress the tectum and distort the proximal aqueduct; occasionally a large cyst may occlude the aqueduct. All patients with obstructive hydrocephalus had cysts greater than 2.0 cm in A-P diameter. Nine patients had suboccipital craniotomy. In all of them, the cysts contained clear fluid and were easily removed. We advocate conservative management with clinical observation of these benign lesions that may be developmental variants of normal pineal gland. \nImipenem/cilastatin treatment of bacterial meningitis in children. The safety and efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin were evaluated in 21 children, ages 3 to 48 months, with bacterial meningitis. Eradication of bacteria from the cerebrospinal fluid was demonstrated within 24 hours of antibiotic therapy in all but 2 patients who had Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis and ultimately achieved bacteriologic cure after 2 to 3 days of imipenem/cilastatin therapy. Cerebrospinal fluid penetrations of imipenem and cilastatin were determined at various times after drug administration with mean cerebrospinal fluid: serum ratios of 14 and 10% for imipenem and cilastatin, respectively. The study was terminated when 7 (33%) patients developed seizure activity after antibiotic therapy was administered. The usefulness of imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children may be limited by a possible increased incidence of drug-related seizure activity. \nReversal of benzodiazepine sedation with the antagonist flumazenil. The effectiveness of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, was evaluated in a randomized double-blind clinical study in which diazepam 0.2 mg kg-1 or midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 was used for i.v. sedation. We studied 120 day-case patients undergoing gastroscopy and treated with either flumazenil 0.1-2 mg or placebo after the procedure. Psychometric assessment of four aspects of recovery over a 3-h period showed that flumazenil attenuated the sedative effects of the benzodiazepines, but did not antagonize the sedation completely. For patients sedated with diazepam, there was a significant effect of flumazenil on speed of motor co-ordination after 90 min (P less than 0.01), and for those given midazolam a similar effect was found at 20 min (P less than 0.01). However, after 3 h all four groups of patients had not returned to baseline performance in accuracy of motor co-ordination (P less than 0.01) and cortical arousal (P less than 0.05), and the two groups sedated with diazepam still displayed memory deficits (P less than 0.05). Flumazenil did not attenuate the subjective experience of sedation as measured by visual analogue scales. These results indicate that sedation is multidimensional, differentially affecting the hierarchy of cognitive functions. In day-cases, antagonism of benzodiazepine sedation with flumazenil would not hasten the safe discharge of patients. \nLaceration of the left pulmonary artery during removal of a bronchogenic cyst by right thoracotomy. Major vascular involvement by a bronchogenic cyst is rare; most large cysts cause respiratory symptoms. We present a case in which a large bronchogenic cyst was adherent to the left pulmonary artery. During removal of the cyst by right thoracotomy, the artery lacerated. Repair of the artery in such a situation taxes the surgeon's ingenuity and decision-making process. \nFacilitated referral to asthma specialist reduces relapses in asthma emergency room visits. Facilitated asthma-specialist care delivered by allergists was compared to generalist care on the rate of relapse of asthma emergency room (ER) visits and hospitalizations and on asthma control in a prospective, controlled study of San Diego Kaiser Health Plan members with asthma. Subjects with asthma between the ages of 6 and 59 years presenting for acute ER care for asthma were systematically assigned by alternating, consecutively, the day of their ER visit to receive either (1) facilitated referral to an asthma specialist within the allergy department and concomitant comprehensive ongoing asthma care (intervention group, n = 149) or (2) continued outpatient management from generalist physicians (control group, n = 160). The course of their asthma was evaluated blindly during the subsequent 6 months by review of medical records, initial and follow-up questionnaires, and spirometry. Compared to the control group, the intervention group noted (1) a 75% reduction in the number of, and percent of, subjects with asthma awakenings per night (p less than or equal to 0.0001), (2) an almost 50% reduction in asthma ER relapses (p = 0.017) resulting from a reduction in the frequency of multiple relapse (p = 0.005), and (3) a greater use of inhaled corticosteroids (p less than 0.00001) and cromolyn (p = 0.002). Thus, facilitated referral of subjects with asthma to specialists in asthma therapy after acute ER therapy appears to reduce asthma ER relapses and to improve asthma outcome. \nTwenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring: the most useful test for evaluating noncardiac chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic capabilities of traditional esophageal tests (manometry and provocative testing with acid and edrophonium) and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring in identifying an esophageal cause of chest pain. DESIGN: A prospective study of 100 consecutive patients referred by cardiologists to the esophageal laboratory for evaluation of esophageal causes of chest pain. SETTING: Tertiary-referral university hospital. METHODS: Esophageal manometry performed with 10 wet swallows of water. Acid perfusion (0.1 N hydrochloric acid) and edrophonium (80 micrograms/kg intravenously) tests were placebo-controlled with a positive study defined as replication of typical chest pain. Esophageal pH monitoring identified (1) abnormal acid exposure times in the upright, supine, or combined position, and (2) correlation between symptoms and acid reflux, i.e., symptom index. The esophagus was identified as \"probably\" contributing to chest pain only if the acid or edrophonium test was positive or if there was a positive correlation between symptoms and acid reflux during pH monitoring. RESULTS: Esophageal manometry was abnormal in 32 patients (32%), but patients were asymptomatic during the study. The acid perfusion test was positive in 18 of 95 patients (19%), and the edrophonium test was positive in 15 of 78 patients (19%). Abnormal acid exposure times were found in 48 patients (48%). Of the 83 patients with spontaneous chest pain during 24-hour pH testing, 37 patients (46%) had abnormal reflux parameters and 50 patients (60%) had a positive symptom index (mean positive score 56%, range 6% to 100%). CONCLUSIONS: Acid reflux is a common and potentially treatable cause of noncardiac chest pain. Traditional esophageal tests usually miss this diagnosis. Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring with symptom correlation is the single best test for evaluating patients with noncardiac chest pain. \nVascular injury: mechanisms and manifestations. Abnormalities in regulatory mechanisms for calcium handling play a key role in cell death and tissue necrosis. In the cardiovascular system this applies to the vasculature and the myocardium alike. In the aged population, where hypertension is a known risk factor, manifestations of vascular injury include atherogenesis and stroke. The newly developed dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonist amlodipine was used in investigations to determine whether calcium antagonists with sustained activity, in addition to lowering blood pressure, slow the development of atherogenesis in rabbits receiving high cholesterol diets, or reduce mortality in stroke-prone hypertensive rats. To establish whether this drug protects the vasculature against excessive atheroma formation in the presence of high cholesterol intake, rabbits were given 2% cholesterol in addition to their normal food intake and either 0, 1, or 5 mg/kg/day amlodipine orally for either 8 or 12 weeks. One day after the conclusion of the treatment protocol, the thoracic aorta was excised, assayed for calcium or cholesterol concentrations, and stained to identify sudanophilic-positive lesions. Amlodipine caused a time- and dose-dependent reduction in lesion formation, calcium overload, and cholesterol level. In the second series of experiments, amlodipine (5 mg/kg/day) was added to the diets of stroke-prone hypertensive rats. Treatment was initiated at age 5 weeks and continued for 30 weeks. During the treatment period, systolic blood pressure was reduced in the amlodipine-treated rats (166 +/- 9 mm Hg) versus those treated with placebo (248 +/- 12 mm Hg) (p less than 0.001). A significant reduction in mortality was observed in the amlodipine-treated rats (p less than 0.001), with 93% surviving versus only 26% in the placebo group at the end of the 30-week treatment period. Concomitantly, cardiac hypertrophy was attenuated in the treated group compared with the placebo group (heart-to-body weight ratios of 4.5 +/- 0.01 vs 5.8 +/- 0.6, respectively [p less than 0.01]). These results extend the evidence that calcium antagonists provide vascular protection in animal models. This finding may become increasingly important in the management of an aging hypertensive population. \nSerum neuron-specific enolase levels after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We examined serum levels of neuron-specific enolase by enzyme immunoassay in 29 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Serum neuron-specific enolase levels were significantly higher in patients with a poor neurological status than in patients with a good neurological status on admission, and the greater the amount of subarachnoid blood, the higher the serum neuron-specific enolase level. Patients with a good outcome had low serum neuron-specific enolase levels throughout their courses. Serum neuron-specific enolase levels increased with development of delayed ischemic neurological deficits and, especially in poor outcome patients, high levels persisted until 3 weeks after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. \nComparison of propranolol, diltiazem, and nifedipine in the treatment of ambulatory ischemia in patients with stable angina. Differential effects on ambulatory ischemia, exercise performance, and anginal symptoms. The ASIS Study Group Episodes of transient myocardial ischemia during ambulatory activities are common in patients with stable coronary artery disease and who are often asymptomatic. Selection of therapy for episodes of asymptomatic ischemia is limited by a lack of direct comparative studies. To determine the most effective monotherapy for patients with stable angina and a high frequency of asymptomatic ischemic episodes, propranolol-LA (mean daily dose, 293 mg), diltiazem-SR (mean daily dose, 350 mg), nifedipine (mean daily dose, 79 mg) were each compared with placebo, each for 2 weeks, in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover trial. Entry criteria were a positive exercise treadmill test during placebo therapy characterized by 1.0 mm or more ST segment depression and angina pectoris, and six or more episodes of transient ST segment depression of 1.0 mm or more on a 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram. One hundred ninety-four patients were screened, 63 were eligible and received randomized therapy, of which 56 patients completed at least two of the four treatment periods and were included in an intent-to-treat analysis. Fifty patients completed all four treatment phases and were included in the protocol-completed analysis. Anti-ischemia efficacy was assessed by 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, exercise treadmill tests, and anginal diaries. Ninety-four percent of all episodes of ambulatory ischemia were asymptomatic. Compared with placebo, only propranolol was associated with a marked reduction in all manifestations of asymptomatic ischemia during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (2.3 versus 1.0 episodes/24 hr; mean duration of ischemia per 24 hours, 43.6 versus 5.7 minutes; both p less than 0.0001). Diltiazem's reduction of the frequency of episodes compared with placebo (2.3 versus 1.9 episodes/24 hr) was associated with a trend (p = 0.08) in the protocol-completed analysis and with a significant reduction in the intent-to-treat analysis (p = 0.03). Nifedipine had no significant effect on any measured variable of ambulatory ischemia. The dosages of medication used may have been excessive for some patients, and a more beneficial effect may have been evident at a lower dose. In contrast to the marked effects of the active agents on ambulatory asymptomatic ischemia, the effects on exercise performance and angina pectoris were slight. The active agents modestly improved treadmill exercise duration time until 1 mm ST segment depression (3%), and only propranolol and diltiazem had significant effects. Only diltiazem significantly prolonged the total exercise time. Anginal frequency was significantly decreased by both propranolol and diltiazem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nComparative histopathology and deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry of random mucosal biopsies in untreated bladder carcinoma. In a study of 290 patients with untreated carcinoma of the bladder, histopathological studies of random mucosal biopsies were compared with the results of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) flow cytometry. By histopathology the findings were classified as severe atypia corresponding to primary grade 3 carcinoma in situ, atypia not fulfilling the criteria for carcinoma in situ and no atypia. The DNA histograms were classified as diploid or aneuploid. Aneuploid cell populations in mucosal biopsies were found mainly in cases with aneuploid tumors of grade 3. Of the biopsies classified as concomitant carcinoma in situ 76% were aneuploid. In biopsies exhibiting less severe or no atypia aneuploidy was found in 41 and 10%, respectively. For these 3 morphological categories the distributions of the aneuploid cell populations were similar irrespective of the histopathological findings and they were also the same as that found in primary carcinoma in situ. We concluded that gross chromosomal aberrations may appear at an early stage of the tumor development and before changes recognizable by morphology. The similarity of the DNA profiles of the aneuploid cell populations, regardless of morphological findings, indicates that apart from gross chromosomal aberrations changes of the phenotype are necessary for the expression of morphological changes. \nHypertonic nasogastric tube feedings: do they cause diarrhea? Hypertonic NG tube feeding in hospitalized patients, whether on the hospital ward or in the ICU, is considered a common etiology of diarrhea. To evaluate the accuracy of this assumption, five normal volunteers, ten hospitalized postoperative patients with head and neck cancer, and 24 ICU patients were given hypertonic (690 mosm), low residue, lactose-free tube feedings starting at 30 kcal/kg.day. There was no prior history of diarrhea in any of the groups studied. There was a significant difference in albumin levels between the three groups, with an average albumin of 2.8 g/dl in the ICU patient group; different from 4.5 g/dl present in both the normal volunteer and non-ICU hospitalized patient groups (general linear models procedure from SAS, p less than .05) (Duncan test). Diarrhea was not present in the normal volunteers or non-ICU patients during the feedings, but did occur in 3/24 ICU patients. This difference was not significant. The three patients with diarrhea had an average albumin level of 3.0 g/dl, while the other ICU patients had an average albumin of 2.7 g/dl. We conclude that hypertonic NG tube feedings do not cause diarrhea in normal volunteers or postoperative head and neck cancer patients. However, in a small statistically insignificant percent of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, this regimen may cause diarrhea although no risk factors can be identified. \nClinical benefits of structural and functional changes with calcium antagonists. Calcium antagonists have a large variety of pharmacologic effects in addition to those exploited clinically. All drugs used in the management of hypertension, including calcium antagonists, are coming under increasing scrutiny for the possible beneficial and adverse effects they may have on the circulation and risk factor profile. This is particularly because of concern about the relative resistance of coronary heart disease to antihypertensive drug treatment and the increasing interest in evaluating the impact of blood pressure-lowering drugs on surrogate endpoints such as left ventricular hypertrophy.
