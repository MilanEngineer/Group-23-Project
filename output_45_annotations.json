        "text": "ion of the fundus showed a marked granularity of the retinal pigmented epithelium in some patients. About one-half of the children and one-third of the adults tested had at least one and usually two abnormalities in their electroretinogram. Determination of blood nutrients thought to affect vision revealed that zinc and vitamin E were within normal range. Vitamin A concentrations were above normal in 10 of 19 adults and selenium concentrations were below normal in 10 of 10 children and 17 of 21 adults tested. Linoleic and linolenic acid concentrations were low; plasma, platelet, and urine taurine concentrations were significantly lower than normal. Despite these diffuse nutrient abnormalities, only zinc and vitamin E concentrations correlated significantly with any index of visual function. \nLymphomas in University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. The authors reviewed 508 cases of lymphoma seen during a 16-year period in University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed in 95 (18.6%) patients, of which 45% had mixed cellularity type; 19%, lymphocyte predominance; 18%, nodular sclerosis; and 18%, lymphocyte depletion. The age distribution showed a single mode in the 11 to 25-year-old group. Male preponderance was more marked in children who made up 32% of the Hodgkin's disease patients. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurred in 413 cases, of which 296 (71.7%) were high-grade malignancies. Burkitt's tumor occurred in 211 (41.5%) patients, 95% of whom were children, and showed a male to female ratio of 1.7:1. Compared with previous findings in this hospital, Hodgkin's disease showed increased proportions of the lymphocyte predominant and nodular sclerosing types. However, the characteristics of Burkitt's lymphoma did not change appreciably in the last three decades. \nInfluence of environmental temperature on the blood pressure of hypertensive patients in Montreal. To assess the influence of environmental temperature on blood pressure, we analyzed 42,813 readings of systolic and diastolic blood pressures in recumbent and upright positions in 2,000 hypertensive patients in our clinic in correlation to noon temperature and mean daily temperature in Montreal. The sample comprised 860 men and 1140 women with an average age of 55 years. Analysis of variance showed highly statistically significant negative correlations for all blood pressure values between different noon temperature, as well as mean daily temperature, groups. The greatest difference for systolic blood pressure was 7 mm Hg, and for diastolic blood pressure it was 3 mm Hg, within the -24 degrees C to 27 degrees C temperature range. The same relationship between blood pressure and different environmental temperatures was also seen when the blood pressure recordings were divided between temperature below 0 degree C and above 0 degree C, ie, within the winter or summer months. This environmental effect may have a clinically significant impact because thermosensitivity appears to be related to hypertension. \nIncreased tryptase levels in suction-blister fluid from patients with urticaria. The levels of tryptase in the suction-blister fluid from patients with chronic urticaria, urticaria pigmentosa, cholinergic urticaria, urticarial dermographism, prurigo of unknown origin, eczema, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and from healthy controls were studied. The blister fluid from controls contained up to 15 micrograms/l of tryptase, whereas that from patients with active urticaria contained greater than 50 micrograms/l. This study demonstrates that patients with urticaria have mast cells that readily release tryptase in both the lesional and non-lesional areas of skin. \nNephrogenic rests in Wilms tumor patients with the Drash syndrome. The histological specimens from 12 patients with the Drash syndrome were identified from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group and reviewed for the presence of nephrogenic rests. Of 7 patients with the complete Drash syndrome 6 were evaluable for nephrogenic rests, including 5 (83%) who demonstrated intralobar nephrogenic rests. Of 5 (80%) partial Drash syndrome cases 4 (80%) were also intralobar nephrogenic rest positive. Neither group had perilobar nephrogenic rests identified. In a control population of Wilms tumor patients without the Drash syndrome only 39 of 274 (14%) with unilateral tumor had intralobar nephrogenic rests identified, whereas 26 of 92 (28%) bilateral cases had intralobar nephrogenic rests. There was a significantly higher rate of intralobar nephrogenic rests in complete and partial Drash syndrome cases than in the general Wilms tumor population (p less than 0.001). Wilms tumor patients with intralobar nephrogenic rests and the Drash syndrome present at a younger age and have a higher rate of bilaterality than rest negative Wilms tumor patients. The strong association of intralobar nephrogenic rests in the Drash syndrome approaches that found in the aniridia complex. However, in other syndromes associated with Wilms tumor, such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and hemihypertrophy, there is a high prevalence of perilobar nephrogenic rests. In view of the high incidence of intralobar nephrogenic rests in complete and partial Drash syndrome patients, it is probable that events leading to Wilms tumor in patients with the Drash syndrome occur at an early stage in nephrogenesis. \nNonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare clinical entity accounting for only 4 per cent of all cases of parathyroid neoplasia. Nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma is even rarer. Previously, virtually all patients with these lesions were treated for a nonspecific neck mass. However, in the present case, a preoperative diagnosis of nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma was made based on the technetium pertechnetate/thallium 201 subtraction scan. The authors report on the 14th case of nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinoma, a review of the literature, and guidelines for the preoperative and operative evaluation of neck masses suspected to be parathyroid carcinoma. \nChildren with epilepsy: the effect of seizures, syndromes, and etiological factors on cognitive functioning. Overall, children with epilepsy have poorer concentration and mental processing and are less alert than age-matched controls. The relationship between cognitive functioning and epilepsy is complex, however, with widely differing degrees of intellectual impairment--ranging from minimal to severe and progressive--related to diverse types of epileptic seizures, syndromes, and etiological factors. Prolonged and frequently repeated seizures are typically associated with more severe effects on cognitive functioning, particularly if epilepsy is symptomatic, i.e., secondary to a demonstrable brain lesion. A combination of such factors may contribute to the mental deterioration seen in many children suffering from severe epilepsy. \nPhase I study of liposomal MTP-PE-activated autologous monocytes administered intraperitoneally to patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. We have conducted a phase I study with autologous monocytes activated ex vivo and administered intraperitoneally in nine patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Blood monocytes were collected by leukapheresis and then purified by counterflow elutriation (up to 10(9) cells, with a purity of greater than 90%). Ex vivo activation was obtained by incubating these cells with 1 micrograms liposomal MTP-PE/10(6) monocytes for 18 hours in hydrophobic culture bags at 37 degrees C in 5% carbon dioxide humidified air. The activated monocytes were then infused in the peritoneal cavity once a week for 5 consecutive weeks through an implanted peritoneal infusion system, Port-A-Cath (Pharmacia Deltec, St Paul, MN), on an intrapatient dose-escalating schedule (10(7) to 10(9) monocytes). No severe adverse reactions occurred. Toxicity was mild, the chief acute reactions being fever (27%), chills (13%), and abdominal pain (25%). None of the side effects led to dose reduction. No consistent change in hemostatic function, liver function, or renal function was observed. Significant increases in granulocyte counts, neopterine, and acute phase reactants (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein) occurred in the peripheral blood. In vitro monocyte activation was demonstrated by the relapse of procoagulant activity and monokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha]) in the supernatants of cultured monocytes. Evidence for in vivo monocyte activation was provided by the increase of these monokines in the peritoneal fluids. Kinetic studies with indium-111 (111In)-labeled activated autologous monocytes in five patients suggest that these infused monocytes may remain in the peritoneal cavity for up to 7 days. This locoregional immunotherapeutic approach seems to be encouraging in view of adjuvant therapeutic modality in ovarian cancer patients with minimal residual intraabdominal disease following second-look laparotomy. \nCancer screening by primary care physicians. Can we explain the differences? BACKGROUND. Physicians perform cancer screening tests less often than recommended. METHODS. Forty primary care physicians were surveyed to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and experiences regarding cancer and cancer screening, and patients' medical records were reviewed to measure physicians' screening rates. RESULTS. Over 80% of physicians believed doctors should urge screening. On average, 23% of their patient visits were scheduled primarily for preventive care interventions. Screening performance scores expressed the percentage of compliance with the American Cancer Society's recommendations and demonstrated the low levels of compliance for six out of seven tests; however, there was substantial variance in performance among physicians. The best predictors of screening performance were (1) the percentage of visits scheduled primarily for prevention (mammography, and pelvic and breast examinations [P less than .05]); and (2) the number of medical journals read regularly (stool occult blood test [P less than .01], sigmoidoscopy [P less than .01], and Papanicolaou smear [P less than .02]). Also, female physicians performed more Papanicolaou smears (P less than .05) and scheduled more visits for preventive care (P less than .001). CONCLUSIONS. A small group of predictors explain large portions of the variance in cancer screening performance. \nRehabilitation in rheumatic diseases. What's new. In the past decade, considerable change has occurred in concepts of rehabilitation in patients with rheumatic diseases. This includes approaches to functional assessment and outcome, new concepts in exercise, and new orthotics. \nIntermediate septal accessory pathways: electrocardiographic characteristics, electrophysiologic observations and their surgical implications Intermediate septal accessory pathways are located in close proximity to the atrioventricular (AV) node and His bundle, have unique features that distinguish them from typical anterior and posterior accessory pathways and have been associated with a high risk for unsuccessful pathway division and the production of complete AV block after surgery. Between July 1986 and May 1990, 4 of 70 patients (3 men and 1 woman; mean age 33 +/- 13 years) undergoing surgery for accessory pathway division were found to have an intermediate septal accessory pathway. The presenting arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation with rapid anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway in two patients and recurrent orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia in two patients. In all patients, the delta wave on the electrocardiogram (ECG) was inverted in lead V1, but two patterns of delta wave configuration were observed. In three patients (type 1 intermediate septal accessory pathway), the delta wave was upright in lead II, inverted in lead III and isoelectric in lead a VF; the transition from a negative to an upright delta wave occurred in lead V2. The fourth patient exhibited a different delta wave pattern (type 2 intermediate septal accessory pathway). The delta wave was upright in each of leads II, III and aVF; the transition from a negative to an upright delta wave occurred at lead V3. Intraoperative electrophysiologic study localized the atrial insertion of type 1 pathways to the midpoint of Koch's triangle close to the AV node. \nSepticaemia after colonoscopy in patients with cirrhosis. Two patients with ulcerative colitis and chronic active hepatitis with cirrhosis, who developed Gram negative septicaemia after colonoscopy are described. These and two similar reported cases indicate that giving prophylactic antibiotics to patients with cirrhosis undergoing colonoscopy should be considered, particularly when the cirrhosis is advanced. \nThe chemoreflex control of breathing and its measurement. The chemoreflex control of breathing is described in terms of a graphical model. The central chemoreflex, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide mediated by the central chemoreceptors, is modelled as a straight-line relation between the ventilatory response and the arterial level of carbon dioxide. The peripheral chemoreflex, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and hypoxia mediated by the peripheral chemoreceptors, is broken into two relations. First, a straight-line relation between the ventilatory response and the arterial level of carbon dioxide whose slope (sensitivity) increases as the oxygen level varies from hyperoxic to hypoxic. Second, a rectangular hyperbolic relation between the ventilatory response and the arterial level of oxygen with ventilation increasing with increasing hypoxia. The three ventilatory response relations (one central and two peripheral) add to produce the total chemoreflex ventilatory response which forms the feedback part of the respiratory regulator. The forward part consists of the relation between the arterial level of carbon dioxide and ventilation when ventilation is controlled (the metabolic hyperbola). The forward and feedback parts of the respiratory regulator can be combined so as to predict resting ventilation and carbon dioxide levels under a number of circumstances. Methods of measurement of these chemoreflex ventilatory responses are also described so as to illustrate the physiological principles involved in the model. \nAre demented patients with Parkinson's disease accurately reflected in prevalence surveys? A survival analysis. We re-reviewed 257 patient records previously reviewed for an incidence study of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) to determine the frequency, date of death, and cause of death. We posited that if disease duration is shortened when dementia occurs, then dementia may be far more common than reflected in prevalence studies. There were 17 deaths among 65 demented patients and 28 deaths among 168 nondemented patients. When we matched a subset of the nondemented patients to the demented patients by age and disease duration distributions, the demented subjects had significantly more deaths (p less than 0.02), and survival among demented subjects was decreased (p less than 0.05). Dementia was a significant predictor of death in this sample. We conclude that dementia reduces survival in patients with PD. Incidence is a much better measure of dementia in PD than prevalence because shortened duration makes it less likely to detect dementia in prevalence surveys. \nManagement of nasal fractures. Fracture of the nasal skeleton is a relatively common injury. Satisfactory treatment requires appropriate skills, diagnosis, and management. Some injuries require immediate attention; others are better treated in delayed fashion. Closed reduction provides satisfactory treatment in the majority of nasal fractures; however, open reduction often is a more appropriate choice. Injuries to the nasal septum should be recognized and given proper treatment. \nMonthly pulses of vincristine and prednisone prevent bone marrow and testicular relapse in low-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report of the CCG-161 study by the Childrens Cancer Study Group. On study CCG-161 of the Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG), 631 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at low risk for relapse were randomized to receive monthly pulses of vincristine-prednisone (VCR-PDN ) during maintenance therapy in addition to standard therapy with mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX), and either cranial irradiation during consolidation or intrathecal (IT) MTX every 3 months during maintenance. All patients received six doses of IT MTX during induction and consolidation. With a minimum follow-up time of 4.25 years, 76.7% receiving VCR-PDN were in continuous complete remission at 5 years, in contrast to 63.9% receiving GMP-MTX alone (P = .002). The difference in relapse-free survival was due primarily to bone marrow relapse (P = .0008), and in boys also to testicular relapse (P = .003). Among the nonirradiated patients, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 79.4% for patients randomized to the VCR-PDN pulses, in contrast to 61.2% for the patients randomized to receive 6MP-MTX alone (P = .0002). Among the irradiated patients, the DFS was not significantly different. Of the four combinations of maintenance and CNS therapy studied, the highest DFS was achieved with VCR-PDN pulses and maintenance IT MTX. \nQuality of life before and after orthotopic hepatic transplantation. Fifty-three nonalcoholic patients were evaluated prior to liver transplantation and again approximately 3 years after surgery using the Sickness Impact Profile and Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule. Test-retest scores reflected significant improvement across all health and psychosocial scales of the Sickness Impact Profile. On the Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule, significant improvement was observed on scales measuring disturbed behavior, social role performance, and burden. Comparisons between groups indicated that the liver transplant patients were still impaired on eight of the Sickness Impact Profile scales after transplant; however, the severity of disturbance was not considered to be clinically significant. No between-group differences were noted on the Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule. These results indicate that liver transplantation is associated with substantial improvement in life quality, although as a group, the patients undergoing this surgery do not recover to the level of functioning demonstrated by normal individuals. \nChylothorax complicating right upper lobectomy. Chylothorax after pleuropulmonary surgery is unusual. We have described the case of a patient in whom this complication followed a right upper lobectomy. Early recognition is important to avoid potential morbidity and mortality. \nSafety and efficacy of repeat thrombolytic treatment after acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction increases the risk of subsequent reocclusion of the infarct related artery. The efficacy and safety of repeat thrombolytic treatment was assessed in 31 patients treated with streptokinase (n = 13) or tissue plasminogen activator (n = 18) a median of five days (1-716) after the first infusion. The indication for readministration was prolonged chest pain with new ST segment elevation. Efficacy was assessed by infarct artery patency at angiography at a median of eight days after readministration in 22 patients and by non-invasive criteria in 23 patients (reperfusion was deemed to be likely if serum creatine kinase was not increased or reached a peak less than 12 hours after infarction). Angiography showed patency of 70% of the infarct arteries after readministration of streptokinase and of 75% after tissue plasminogen activator. The corresponding patency rates assessed noninvasively were 73% and 75%. Reinfarction was prevented in nine (29%) patients. Allergic reactions occurred in four of eight patients who received streptokinase twice (plasmacytosis and acute reversible renal failure developed in one patient). Two patients had major bleeding and two minor bleeding, all after tissue plasminogen activator, and one of them died of cerebral haemorrhage. Repeat thrombolytic treatment results in late patency rates similar to the rates after the initial administration. Allergic reactions were common in those treated twice with streptokinase. \nA prospective evaluation of hepatic resection for colorectal carcinoma metastases to the liver: Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group Protocol 6584. We report here the results of the first multiinstitutional prospective evaluation of patients considered to have potentially resectable hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma. One hundred fifty-six patients were enrolled from 15 institutions. Six patients were subsequently excluded. One hundred fifty patients underwent surgery and are evaluable for analysis (median follow-up time, 3.1 years; range, 4 months to 5.1 years). Curative resection could be performed on 46% of patients (69 of 150), noncurative resection on 12% (18 of 150), while 42% were found to be unresectable (63 of 150). Thirty-day surgical mortality and morbidity rates in patients with attempted resection were 2.7% and 13%, respectively. The curative resection group was observed to have an improved median survival (37.1 months) compared with the noncurative resection group (21.2 months) and the unresectable group (16.5 months) (P less than .01). Computed tomographic (CT) scan was a poor predictor for resectability, and age was not a contraindication to curative resection. Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values were also a poor predictor for resectability. However, the median CEA value 61 to 180 days postsurgery was significantly higher in unresectable patients compared with median CEA levels in noncuratively and curatively resected groups (P less than .01). Our results imply that curative resection leads to an increase in median survival. Noncurative resection provides no benefit to asymptomatic patients, since unresectable and noncurative resection groups have similar life expectancies. Longer follow-up will be needed to demonstrate the ultimate impact of curative resection on survival. \nMitotane enhances cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in cell lines expressing a multidrug resistance gene (mdr-1/P-glycoprotein) which is also expressed by adrenocortical carcinomas. P-Glycoprotein (Pgp), product of the mdr-1 gene, is a 130- to 180-kDa plasma membrane phosphoglycoprotein which mediates multidrug resistance in cell culture by increasing efflux of the natural product chemotherapeutic agents. High levels of expression of mdr-1/Pgp are found in both the normal adrenal and adrenocortical cancers. By RNA in situ hybridization the expression in adrenocortical cancer is shown to be widely distributed. The present study demonstrates that decreased drug accumulation mediated by mdr-1/Pgp can be overcome by clinically achievable concentrations of mitotane (o,p'-DDD). The increase in drug accumulation with the addition of mitotane is due at least in part to a decrease in drug efflux and results in an increase in cytotoxicity when agents of the natural product class are used. This effect is observed in cells with a broad range of mdr-1/Pgp expression, including levels comparable to those found in most adrenocortical cancers. Similar increases in drug accumulation can be demonstrated in an unselected adrenocortical cancer cell line that expresses mdr-1/Pgp. The finding that multidrug resistance mediated by mdr-1/Pgp can be reversed by mitotane provides a rational basis for exploring the use of mitotane in combination with natural product chemotherapeutic agents in adrenocortical cancer. \nEstablishment and characterization of a human carcinoid in nude mice and effect of various agents on tumor growth. The authors have established a long-term tissue culture cell line (BON) derived from a metastatic human carcinoid tumor of the pancreas. The cells have been in continuous passage for 46 months. Tissue culture cells produce tumors in a dose-dependent fashion after SC inoculation of cell suspensions in athymic nude mice. BON tumors, grown in nude mice, are histologically identical to the original tumor; they possess gastrin and somatostatin receptors, synthesize serotonin and chromogranin A, and have a doubling time of approximately 13 days. The antiproliferative effects of the long-acting somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995 (300 micrograms/kg, t.i.d.), and 2% alpha-difluoromethylornithine on BON xenografts in nude mice were examined. Tumor size was significantly decreased by day 14 of treatment with either agent and at all points of analysis thereafter until the animals were killed (day 33). In addition, tumor weight, DNA, RNA, and protein contents were significantly decreased in treated mice compared with controls. Establishment of this human carcinoid xenograft line, BON, provides an excellent model to study further the biological behavior of carcinoid tumors and the in vivo effect of chemotherapeutic agents on tumor growth. \nXenobiotic enzyme profiles and Parkinson's disease. Xenobiotic enzymic systems have been studied in Parkinson's disease. Platelet monoamine oxidase-B activity is increased by the use of phenylethylamine but decreased by the use of dopamine as substrate. Enzymes involved with sulfur oxidation and methylation are underactive. \nEmergency medical services and the pediatric patient. III: Resources of ambulatory care centers. Ambulatory care centers have emerged as a new health care resource in many communities. Little information is available about the services that these centers offer to pediatric patients. A national survey of 254 ambulatory care centers was undertaken to determine their characteristics, including the number of pediatric patients seen, staffing patterns, and pediatric equipment and supplies available. Most clinics were located in urban areas and were within 5 miles of a hospital. They were staffed primarily by physicians who were board certified in emergency medicine, internal medicine, or family medicine. Not all centers had registered nurses on duty and few used extended-role nurses or physicians's assistants. The centers saw an average of 18 patients younger than 18 years of age per day. Some ambulatory care centers received emergency medical service and private ambulance calls and encountered serious illness such as chest pain, seizures, and anaphylaxis; the majority, however, handled mainly minor injuries and illnesses. Although most had pediatric equipment and supplies, some did not have a complete set of pediatric resuscitation equipment even though they were part of the emergency system offering care to the pediatric population. \nAssociated neurologic and ophthalmologic findings in congenital oculomotor nerve palsy. Unlike acquired oculomotor nerve palsy in childhood, the congenital form is usually considered to be an isolated disorder, not associated with other neurologic or systemic disease. In a series of 14 patients with this diagnosis, 10 had associated neurologic disorders. Clinical-neuroradiologic correlation identified the brainstem as the site of the lesion in some patients. The ipsilateral pupil was involved in 12 patients and was miotic with a trace or no reaction to light on the side of the palsy in 8 of the 12 patients. In two of these eight patients, the pupil was documented to be dilated and fixed in early infancy and subsequently became miotic at several months of age, concurrent with emergence of other signs of aberrant reinnervation. Pupillary miosis as a result of aberrant reinnervation appears to be much more frequent after congenital than acquired pupillary-involving oculomotor palsy. Four patients showed better visual acuity in the paretic eye, an unexpected finding. The paretic eye appeared to have a fixational advantage if the patient had nystagmus, presumably due to asymmetric dampening of the nystagmus. Significant anisometropia and astigmatic errors in the paretic eye were present in essentially all patients. \nCombined treatment of symptomatic gallbladder stones by extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Twenty-four patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones (12 radiolucent and 12 calcified) were treated by a combined approach of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and subsequent instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The patients received a mean of 1500 +/- 185 shock-wave discharges. The mean instillation time of MTBE was 13 +/- 4.2 hr. Treatment was tolerated without major adverse effects. Within a time period of three to five days eight of 12 patients with pure radiolucent stones and four of 12 with calcified stones became stone-free. After a median follow-up of five months (range: one week to 26 months), a total of 11 patients (92%) with radiolucent stones and of eight patients (66%) of those with calcified stones were free of stones, fragments, or debris. These clearance rates appear high when compared with reports on monotherapy with ESWL or MTBE, suggesting a positive effect of a combined approach in selected patients. Two patients exhibited recurrent stones after six and seven months, respectively. \nTranspalpebral extrusion of a silicone sponge exoplant. We report an unusual case of scleral buckle extrusion in a 63-year-old woman. A 5 mm silicone sponge exoplant eroded through Tenon's capsule, conjunctiva, and full-thickness upper eyelid, traversing the tarsal plate. \nThe role of endoscopic papillotomy in ascending cholangitis. The role of endoscopic papillotomy in calculous cholangitis is unclear. A retrospective review of 41 patients admitted to hospital with calculous cholangitis was carried out. There were 30 women and 11 men and their ages ranged between 49 and 98 years (mean age 77). All patients presented with abdominal pain, tenderness, chills, and fever. Clinical jaundice was present in 95 per cent of the patients. Initial endoscopic papillotomy was successful in 17 of the 41 patients. In 24 patients cholangitis persisted or recurred and further therapy was carried out. Surgery was successful in controlling sepsis in ten of the 24 patients. Repeat endoscopic papillotomy was successful in four of 13 patients. Surgery was successful in one of nine patients who had failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy. Nasobiliary drainage and percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the common bile duct after failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy was successful in only two of nine patients. Six patients died after failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy. We conclude that initial endoscopic papillotomy should be attempted in patients with calculous cholangitis. Surgical exploration of the common bile duct should then be carried out if initial endoscopic papillotomy fails to control cholangitis. \nOutcome of infants and children with dilated cardiomyopathy. A review of 81 infants and children with dilated, poorly contracting left ventricles without associated structural abnormalities was undertaken to identify risk factors for poor outcome, which could be used in selecting candidates for cardiac transplantation. Significant atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias, or both, were detected on presentation or during follow-up in 24 patients. Arrhythmias were present in only 8 of 51 survivors (16%) but were detected in 16 of 30 patients (53%) who died (p less than 0.05). Patients dying suddenly were even more likely to have had documented dysrhythmias (8 of 11, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular shortening fraction was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors (14.9 +/- 1.0% vs 15.3 +/- 1.7%). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in 44 patients who had cardiac catheterization averaged 20.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in patients who died than in those who survived (29.5 +/- 2.2 vs 15.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Analysis of actuarial survival revealed that mortality was highest during the first 6 months after presentation (19% mortality). Survival declined more gradually thereafter and was 70% at 2 years, 64% at 5 years and 52% after 11.5 years. Age at initial presentation did not have any significant impact on survival. However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 25 torr was associated with a significantly increased mortality rate (p less than 0.05). Early cardiac transplantation should be considered in patients with markedly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or complex atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. \nUpper abdominal cancer surgery in the very elderly. From January 1981 to December 1987, 59 major upper abdominal operations were performed on 57 patients aged 80 to 90 years at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Procedures for primary adenocarcinoma of the stomach, distal esophagus, pancreas, or hepatobiliary system were performed with curative intent or for palliation in 34 of 59 patients (58%) and bypass with limited or no resection in 13 of 59 patients (22%) patients. Emergency operations were performed in six (10%) patients for gastric bleeding, perforation, or outlet obstruction. Six (10%) patients underwent laparotomy for benign biliary obstruction (1), splenectomy for secondary thrombocytopenia (2), or gastrectomy for sarcoma (2) or lymphoma (1). Hospital mortality was 15% overall and 9% for major resections, 15% for bypass, and 67% for emergency procedures. Major complications occurred in 10 (20%) elective procedures. Mortality was associated with respiratory or cardiac failure while complications most commonly included arrhythmias and wound infection. Mean postoperative hospitalization was 18 days overall and 45 patients (76%) were discharged home. Median survival following major resection was 17.5 months but less than 2 months after bypass procedures. A protocol of pre-operative evaluation, intra-operative hemodynamic monitoring and postoperative intensive care has been formalized for use in elderly or poor-risk patients. \nInsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Contrasting results have been reported regarding the prevalence of hypertension in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), showing a slightly higher or normal percentage of IDDM patients with elevated blood pressure levels than in the general population. Most of the cross-sectional and prospective studies on the prevalence of hypertension in IDDM show an association between microalbuminuria and elevated blood pressure levels. However, it is not clear whether hypertension is simply secondary to kidney damage or whether hypertension occurs with or even before the development of impaired kidney function. Patients with IDDM have a higher exchangeable body Na+ pool. Na+ retention in IDDM is accounted for by several metabolic and hormonal abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, hyperinsulinemia, altered secretion, and resistance to atrial natriuretic peptide. High blood pressure appears to be dependent, at least at some phase, on expansion of extracellular fluid volume as a consequence of defects in the renal secretion of Na+ and water. On the other hand, a tendency toward Na+ retention characterizes all patients with IDDM, whereas hypertension develops only in a subgroup of diabetic patients. One possible explanation for these findings is that a genetic predisposition plays a role in creating susceptibility to hypertension and perhaps to diabetic nephropathy independent of diabetes, even if Na+ retention can further deteriorate this susceptibility to hypertension. With regard to this issue, it has recently been suggested that the risk of kidney disease in patients with IDDM is associated with a genetic predisposition to hypertension. Furthermore, diabetic nephropathy occurs in familial clusters, because diabetic siblings of nephropathic diabetic patients show a higher frequency of diabetic nephropathy than the diabetic siblings of nonnephropathic diabetic patients. One of the possible genetic markers that could be useful to identify the diabetic patients with susceptibility to hypertension and diabetic nephropathy is the Na+(-)Li+ countertransport activity in erythrocytes. \nSonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Acute appendicitis can be a diagnostic dilemma. The classic triad of leukocytosis, pain at McBurney's point and a history compatible with appendicitis has a diagnostic accuracy rate of only 80 percent. Ultrasonography, combined with this triad, can improve the diagnostic accuracy, decreasing the negative laparotomy rate from 20 percent to less than 10 percent. \nSource of tubercle bacilli in cervical lymph nodes: a prospective study. A prospective study searching for associated mycobacterial infection of the upper aerodigestive tract in patients with cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBLN) was carried out. One hundred and thirteen patients with a clinical suspicion of cervical TBLN were included. All patients had a physical examination of the upper aerodigestive tract. Routine endoscopy and biopsy of the nasopharynx were performed. All of them had surgery to the cervical lymph node. Seventy-five patients had histologically confirmed cervical TBLN. Culture of the lymph node specimen showed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 68 (90 per cent). In 45 (60 per cent) patients with cervical TBLN the primary foci of infection could not be found. Twenty-nine (39 per cent) had radiographic evidence of active or healed pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum culture from two patients showed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Five patients (six per cent) had tuberculous nasopharyngitis. In one of them (one per cent) the tuberculous nasopharyngitis was primary as no other evidence of mycobacterial infection was found. In the present study, mycobacterial infection of other parts of the upper aerodigestive tract was not found. \nDown-regulation of messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels for estrogen receptors by phorbol ester and calcium in MCF-7 cells. Treatment of MCF-7 cells, a human mammary carcinoma cell line, with phorbol ester [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)] or calcium ionophore (A23187) was associated with striking effects on levels of estrogen receptor (ER) mRNA, specific binding of 17 beta-[3H]estradiol [( 3H]E2), and immunoreactive ER. TPA (10(-7) M) caused a time-dependent reduction of ER mRNA which was below the level of detection after 9 h. Similar effects of TPA appeared at levels of specific binding of [3H]E2 as well as immunoreactive ER. In contrast, TPA induced an increase in mRNA for beta-actin. Incubation of MCF-7 cells with increasing concentrations of TPA (10(-11)-10(-7) M) was associated with biphasic effects on ER mRNA and proteins. Levels of immunoreactive progesterone receptors (PR) were induced by E2 (10(-9) M) in a time-dependent manner. In the presence of TPA (10(-7) M), where ER levels were suppressed, no induction of PR was observed. Removal of TPA (10(-7) M) after 10 h (ER mRNA) or 22 h (ER proteins) of treatment was associated with a continued suppression of both mRNA and protein levels during the entire incubation period (48 h). Treatment with A23187 (2 x 10(-7) M) also caused a time-dependent down-regulation of levels of ER mRNA and proteins. These effects occurred somewhat more slowly than those of TPA. Levels of beta-actin mRNA were not changed by this treatment. These results indicate that changes in estrogen sensitivity are mediated by calcium-dependent protein kinases in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells. \nExamination of cardiorespiratory changes during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Comparison of monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, arterial pressure and the electrocardiogram. Critical events including hypoxaemia, arrhythmias and myocardial ischaemia may occur more frequently during endoscopic procedures than during anaesthesia. A study was undertaken to assess the cardiovascular changes and to evaluate suitable monitoring techniques to detect critical events during sedation and endoscopy. Twenty patients scheduled to undergo a prolonged endoscopic procedure which required deep sedation were studied. Continuous recordings of electrocardiogram, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were made and arterial pressure was recorded at one-minute intervals. The study commenced immediately before administration of sedatives, continued for the duration of the examination and for one hour following the examination. Oxygen saturation decreased in all patients during the examination to a mean of 82.9% (SD 11.9), and remained below baseline for the duration of the examination and into the recovery period. Statistically significant increases and reductions of systolic arterial pressure and rate-pressure product were found during the procedures compared with baseline values recorded before administration of sedatives. Sixteen of the 20 patients developed tachycardia during the examination. Ten patients developed ectopic foci which were supraventricular, ventricular or both in origin. Electrocardiogram changes resolved during the recovery period. Myocardial ischaemia was assessed by S-T segment depression and a significant correlation was found between S-T segment depression and hypoxaemia, although the magnitude of the S-T depression was small and may not have been detected clinically. No correlation was found between S-T segment depression and arterial pressure, heart rate or rate-pressure product. \nPathogenesis of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy: correlation of chest radiographic and clinical findings in 54 patients. The pathogenesis of pulmonary edema that occurs during interleukin-2 therapy has often been attributed to an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability. However, renal insufficiency, fluid overload, and hypotension also develop in many patients. These manifestations of systemic toxicity may contribute to the development of pulmonary edema during therapy. Understanding the cause of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy could directly affect patients' care. Therefore, we reviewed the chest radiographs and clinical course of 54 patients who received high-dose interleukin-2 therapy and lymphokine-activated killer cells for advanced carcinoma. The type, frequency, and course over time of pulmonary abnormalities were recorded and correlated with clinical measures of renal function, fluid status, and blood pressure. Focal or diffuse parenchymal lung opacities were found on radiographs in 43 (80%) of 54 patients. Findings of interstitial pulmonary edema were most common, occurring in 76% of patients. Weight gain, hypotension, and elevation of the serum creatinine level were not associated statistically with interstitial edema. Diffuse air-space disease developed in 20% of patients. Focal consolidation, which was associated with positive central venous catheter cultures (p less than .03), developed in 28% of patients. Pleural effusion occurred in 48% of patients and was associated with all types of parenchymal disease. These data suggest that the frequent development of pulmonary edema during interleukin-2 therapy is not due to renal insufficiency, fluid overload, or hypotension, but is more likely the result of an interleukin-2-related increase in pulmonary capillary permeability. \nIdentification of the viral genes responsible for growth of strains of reovirus in cultured mouse heart cells. Viral growth in specific tissue is usually required in order to lead to pathology. Two reovirus isolates (type 1 Lang and type 3 Dearing) differ in their capacity to grow in cultured mouse heart cells. The mammalian reoviruses contain a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA gene segments. By the use of 37 reassortant viruses (consisting of viruses with different combinations of genes derived from the two parents), difference in capacity of different strains to grow in heart cells was mapped to three different genes, all of which encode viral core proteins: the M1 gene (P less than 0.000044); the L1 gene (P = 0.00094); and the L3 gene (P = 0.019). Using the same set of reassortant viruses, the L1 (P = 0.00015) and L3 (P = 0.0065) genes were involved in differences of the ability of viral strains to grow in mouse L cells (fibroblasts), but the M1 gene (P = 0.12) was not. These findings suggest that the M1 gene plays an important and specific role in determining the relative capacity of certain viral strains to grow in the heart. Thus, we have identified viral genes responsible for differing growth capacity in heart muscle cells in culture. These findings provide a novel system for studies of viral myocarditis at a molecular genetic level. \nIliopectineal bursitis: an unusual cause of iliofemoral vein compression. The iliopectineal bursa is the largest bursa in the region of the hip joint. Enlargement of the bursa occurs in several conditions and may be manifested by groin pain, a pelvic or inguinal mass, or lower extremity edema due to compression of the external iliac or common femoral vein. A case of lower extremity edema secondary to external iliac/common femoral vein compression caused by an enlarged iliopectineal bursa is presented. The pathophysiology, methods of diagnosis, and forms of therapy are discussed. \nInsulin and cardiovascular disease. Paris Prospective Study. The Paris Prospective Study is a long-term investigation of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in a large population of working men. The baseline cohort included 7028 men, 6093 who had a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with measurement of plasma insulin and glucose levels (0 and 2 h) and 125 who were known non-insulin-treated diabetic patients. After a mean follow-up of 11 yr, 126 deaths ascribed to CHD were reported. Major independent predictors of CHD death were blood pressure, smoking, plasma cholesterol level, and fasting and 2-h postload plasma insulin level. Impairment of glucose tolerance, including overt diabetes, did not rank as an independent predictor when other baseline variables were accounted for. In the subset of the baseline cohort who presented with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes (n = 943), 26 died from CHD during the follow-up. The strongest independent predictor of subsequent CHD death in this subsample with abnormal glucose tolerance was plasma triglyceride level. In view of the accumulating evidence that hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia generally occur in the same type of subjects, in relation to insulin resistance and central obesity, the epidemiological findings of the Paris Prospective Study and of other investigations support the hypothesis that a constellation of mild metabolic abnormalities may play a deleterious role with regard to cardiovascular disease risk. \nResectoscopic myomectomy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of resectoscopic myomectomy for control of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and/or reproductive wastage. DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive patient follow-up. SETTING: Private practice, outpatient, hospital. PATIENTS: All patients (92) having resectoscopic myomectomy between September 1, 1986 and December 31, 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Resectoscopic myomectomy with or without concomitant procedures such as endometrial ablation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and reproductive outcome after surgery. RESULTS: Elimination of dysmenorrhea in 24 of 28, absence of menorrhagia in 65 of 80, and pregnancy in 10 of 13 with two abortions in a total of 11 gestations. One patient was admitted and treated with one unit of autologous blood and mechanical tamponade with an intrauterine balloon. Three cases of uterine perforation had no sequelae. One patient had mild endometritis responding to outpatient antibiotics. Two cases of leiomyosarcoma were diagnosed histologically and accounted for two of the three hysterectomies noted during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Resectoscopic myomectomy is a safe, effective, and relatively simple outpatient surgical procedure. \nAbundant expression of EBER1 small nuclear RNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A morphologically distinctive target for detection of Epstein-Barr virus in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded carcinoma specimens. The highly restricted expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in malignancy has limited the use of EBV detection methods applicable to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded carcinoma specimens. In EBV-transformed lymphocytes very short nonprotein coding EBV transcripts (EBERs) are expressed in much higher abundance (10(7) copies per cell) than other EBV latency transcripts. Using a 3H riboprobe, the authors demonstrated EBER1 expression in NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMAS (NPCs) as well as in parotid salivary gland. Recognition of EBER1 expression was facilitated by the intensity of hybridization and its characteristic morphology (nuclear with nucleolar sparing). EBER1 expression was not demonstrated in other epithelial malignancies arising from mucosal surfaces (oropharynx, uterine cervix) from which EBV shedding has been detected. Repeat study of the NPC specimens with digoxigenin-labeled probe yielded hybridization signal with subcellular morphologic detail and without background in a 12-hour procedure. Thus the EBER1 transcript is an appropriate target for in situ hybridization detection of EBV in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded carcinoma specimens. \nDisorders of hypopigmentation in children. The most common disorders of hypopigmentation in children are pityriasis alba, vitiligo, nevus depigmentosus, and tinea versicolor. Pityriasis alba usually presents as ill defined, scaly patches of hypomelanosis on the cheeks of children with an atopic diathesis. The face is also a favored site for vitiligo, but the distribution is periorificial, and the pigment loss is complete because of a destruction of melanocytes. Vitiligo is an acquired, progressive disorder in contrast to nevus depigmentosus, which is a stable, congenital leukoderma. The localized form of nevus depigmentosus must be distinguished from an ash leaf spot, the earliest cutaneous manifestation of tuberous sclerosis, whereas the systematized form may be confused with hypomelanosis of Ito, another neurocutaneous disorder. The lesions of tinea versicolor favor the upper trunk of adolescents, and potassium hydroxide examination of the associated scale reveals hyphal and yeast forms of P. orbiculare. Any inflammatory process in the skin such as dermatitis or psoriasis can resolve with areas of hypopigmentation. \nEffect of hemostatic agents in canine gastric serosal blood vessels. The efficacy of various sclerotherapeutic agents in the control of acute bleeding, via subserosal injection, was assessed in 10 dogs. Blood flow rate (BFR) from severed gastric serosal vessels (diameter, 1.6 to 2.2 mm) was measured for 3 min (ml/min) for a control group and the agent used. The agents tested were 5 ml of normal saline (NS), 5 ml of 3% hypertonic saline (HS), 5 ml of 1:10,000 epinephrine in NS, 5 ml of 1:10,000 epinephrine/HS, 5 ml of 1:20,000 epinephrine/HS, 2 ml of old thrombin \"cocktail\" (thrombin, cephapirin + 1% tetradecyl), and 2 ml of fresh thrombin cocktail (total seven). One agent was tested per dog; there were one to two dogs in each subgroup. All of the agents showed significant reduction in BFR (except old thrombin) when compared with BFR of control vessels. The reduction ranged from 30% to more than 75% after 1:10 epinephrine/HS. Complete hemostasis was achieved in up to 47% of vessels using 1:20 epinephrine/HS. Overall, the epinephrine solutions achieved the best results. No systemic effects were observed with the use of any of the agents. Histological studies showed that epinephrine caused mild tissue damage, whereas the cocktail caused significant tissue necrosis. This serosal vessel model permits comparison of the effectiveness of each agent; however, clinical extrapolation to mucosal vessels in a patient and the long-term histological changes are not known. \nMyasthenia gravis in childhood and infancy. Usefulness of electrophysiologic studies. The diagnostic yield of electrodiagnostic tests was evaluated in 21 children with myasthenia gravis (MG). Twelve children had juvenile autoimmune MG, four had neonatal MG, four had congenital MG, and one had MG with arthrogryposis. Repetitive stimulation (RS) of the ulnar nerve was performed in every patient, sometimes with sensitization by ischemia. When the RS test was negative, the spinal or facial nerve was tested. In the group with neonatal MG, the RS test disclosed a significant decrement in 75% of the patients. Among the 17 other children, the overall percentage of positive RS tests was 88%. An ulnar nerve RS test was positive in 41% of them. Sensitization of ulnar nerve RS by ischemia improved the diagnostic yield to 66%. A spinal or facial nerve RS test was positive in seven of 10 patients. These results confirmed the diagnostic value of RS, with sensitization by ischemia, when necessary, in childhood MG whenever a careful technique is provided. \nA low dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin regimen in superficial bladder cancer therapy: is it effective? Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intravesical therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. To date, however, the optimal treatment schedule must be defined and the toxicity related to the treatment is significant. The preliminary results of a randomized ongoing study performed to evaluate the effectiveness and relative toxicity of a low dose (75 mg.) BCG regimen in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer therapy are reported. A total of 126 patients (70 for prophylaxis of recurrent stages Ta and T1 papillary tumors and 56 for treatment of carcinoma in situ or with microinfiltration of the subepithelial connective tissue) underwent a 6-week course of 75 mg. BCG (Pasteur vaccine). An additional course was given in patients who failed to respond to the induction course. Maintenance therapy was administered in complete responders monthly for 1 year and then quarterly for 1 year. The prophylaxis group (transurethral resection plus BCG) was randomized versus transurethral resection alone (63 patients, control group). A complete response in the prophylaxis, control and therapy groups was observed in 74, 17 and 57% of the patients, respectively, while 4, 17 and 12.5%, respectively, experienced tumor progression. The additional course of therapy increased the response rate. On the contrary, previous unsuccessful intravesical chemotherapy did not affect the response rate. In regard to toxicity, irritative disturbances (27%) and fever (17%) appeared to be significantly decreased compared with the rates reported in the literature. No major complications were experienced. In conclusion, a low dose (75 mg.) Pasteur strain BCG regimen was effective as prophylaxis against recurrent superficial papillary tumors and as treatment of carcinoma in situ or with microinfiltration of the subepithelial connective tissue. Toxicity related to the treatment appeared to be low. \nIssues, goals, and guidelines in selecting first-line drug therapy for hypertension. Modern antihypertensive therapy is enriched by an explosion in drug development that makes available increasingly specific agents whose effects have advanced our understanding of pressor mechanisms. This and other research into hypertensive mechanisms has defined the clinical, pharmacological, and endocrinologic heterogeneity of human hypertension. The sum of these developments is a greatly enhanced ability to identify curable and definable causes of hypertension and to pathophysiologically stratify the remaining cases of essential hypertension. Modern treatment can be much more specific than before. When long-term drug therapy is indicated, the regimen is more likely to achieve a primary goal for each patient, that is, the fewest possible drugs in the smallest amount and in lowest frequency. Two clinically quantifiable mechanisms for long-term arteriolar vasoconstriction can be identified within the spectrum of human hypertension. The first, renin-mediated vasoconstriction, is directly related to the plasma renin level. The second, sodium-volume-related vasoconstriction, is marked by a reciprocally subnormal renin level and involves abnormal sodium retention and calcium transport. A baseline renin-sodium profile can identify the pressure of one of these two forms of vasoconstriction and therefore is the key for the diagnosis of the two curable disorders that fully express one of the two pressor mechanisms--renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Renovascular hypertension, more common than once thought, is often cured by angioplasty. It is important to diagnose these curable forms before beginning long-term drug therapy. The renin-sodium profile, used in conjunction with serum potassium and creatinine measurements, is valuable not only in screening patients for curable forms, but also for stratifying the remainder according to the pathophysiological vasoconstrictor mechanism that underlies the hypertension. Converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers are, by themselves, often effective in correcting the hypertension of high- or medium-renin patients, whereas calcium antagonists, diuretic agents, or alpha-blockers alone are most effective against the low-renin form of vasoconstriction. In the large midzone of renin values, if monotherapy fails, a rational basis for combined antirenin-antisodium volume therapies can be developed. \nAnimal models of fulminant hepatic failure. The six requirements for a satisfactory animal model of fulminant hepatic failure are reversibility, reproducibility, death from liver failure, a therapeutic window, a large animal model, and minimal hazard to personnel. Different models may be required to evaluate the various types of liver failure seen in man. The available models include surgical anheptic and devascularization procedures, as well as hepatotoxic drug administration using agents such as carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, or galactosamine. Currently combined surgical and drug models appear to provide the best model but the search for the ideal models continues. \nEpipalatus: a rare intraoral teratoma. A wide range of discrete head and neck tumors are developmental, including those termed choristoma, hamartoma, dermoid cysts, teratoid tumors, and true teratomas. In classifying various teratomas, consideration is given to the embryonal layers represented within the substance of the tumor and to their level of organizational complexity. By definition, a hamartoma is a tissue mass, present at or near the time of birth, that is benign and native to the site of origin. Growth capacity of a hamartomatous process parallels that of the host organism. A choristoma, on the other hand, is a mass of tissue that is foreign to the site of discovery and is thought to result from growth to displaced primordial tissue that is histologically normal for that tissue. \nMagnetic resonance imaging for detecting and treatment monitoring of orthotopic murine bladder tumor implants. We assessed the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detection and treatment monitoring of early stage orthotopic murine bladder (MBT-2) tumor implants. Thirty mice were scheduled for imaging at six, 14, 18 and 21 days after tumor implantation. Using a volume imaging coil, MRI demonstrated very early orthotopic tumors, the detection of which would otherwise have been impossible by clinical signs only. Sequential accurate assessment of tumor size was achieved by inflation of the bladders with a fixed volume of Gadolinium-DTPA contrast. The presence of established MBT-2 intravesical tumors was confirmed by gross pathology and light microscopy of the corresponding whole mount bladder sections. Histological examination of the corresponding tumor specimens revealed the presence of transitional cell bladder carcinoma which correlated very well with the topography and depth of tumor involvement as indicated on MRI. The The mice tolerated repeated MR imaging well. Early tumors at day 14 were detectable on MRI (with serial tumor growth to day 21), with no clinical signs of disease. In a subsequent study, response to intravesical tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) immunotherapy was monitored with serial MRI. The serial MR images from six tumor-bearing mice (three controls and three TNF-alpha treated) have been selected to illustrate the consistent findings of this study. Sequential MRI scans of TNF-alpha treated mice revealed retardation of tumor growth that correlated well with the corresponding histologic examination. The orthotopic tumor and MRI model described is ideal for preclinical evaluation of new potential intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents. \nStudies on the cellular origin of neurothekeoma: clinical, light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural observations. The clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features of 11 cases of neurothekeoma are reported. One case was examined by electron microscopy. The mean age of the patients was 27.1 years; the study comprised eight female and three male patients. Most lesions were nondescript papules and located on the upper part of the body, seven cases of neurothekeoma on the head. Eight cases were classified as cellular neurothekeoma on the basis of a striking fascicular pattern and three cases as myxomatous neurothekeoma because of prominent myxoid stromal change. All cellular neurothekeomas failed to express S-100 protein, whereas the three myxomatous types were strongly positive for this marker. Other than vimentin, there was no significant immunoreactivity with other immunohistochemical markers. Ultrastructural study of one case of cellular neurothekeoma was inconclusive for cell type although a perineurial origin could not be excluded. On the basis of these results, we conclude that cellular neurothekeoma differs from myxomatous neurothekeoma not only by clinical and histologic findings but also by immunoreactivity with S-100 protein. These findings also suggest the existence of two distinct subtypes of neurothekeoma and possible origin of the two variants of neurothekeoma from different cell types or at least variation in phenotypic expression of a common cell type. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that these two variants are different stages in the natural history of neurothekeoma. \nDifferences in prostaglandin metabolism in cultured aortic and pulmonary arterial endothelial cells exposed to acute and chronic hypoxia. In vivo, a marked difference in blood oxygen tension exists between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Responses of vascular endothelial cells from these vessels to changes in ambient oxygen might be influenced by the oxygen tension to which they are continuously exposed in vivo or by their anatomic site. To explore this hypothesis, we initially studied the production of the cyclooxygenase metabolites prostacyclin and thromboxane in bovine aortic and main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells grown in 21% O2 and exposed to different degrees of acute hypoxia over a wide range of times. We found that short-term hypoxia (3% or 0% O2) rapidly and transiently activates the cyclooxygenase pathway in both cell types, with a more rapid response in bovine aortic endothelial cells. To determine whether culture in an oxygen tension similar to that to which main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells are exposed in vivo alters this response, we evaluated these cyclooxygenase metabolites in bovine aortic and main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells cultured long-term in 3% O2, both at baseline and after exposure to acute anoxia (0% O2). In both cell types, we found a decrease in prostacyclin and thromboxane synthesis at baseline and evidence of an increase in the Vmax of thromboxane synthetase following stimulation with exogenous arachidonic acid. In chronically hypoxic cells exposed to acute anoxia, there were marked differences in enzyme activity compared with that in endothelial cells maintained in 21% O2 with differences depending on the origin of the endothelial cells. In bovine aortic endothelial cells, production of neither cyclooxygenase metabolite increased; in bovine main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, only thromboxane production increased, suggesting isolated activation of the cyclooxygenase-thromboxane synthetase pathway. These studies demonstrate that acute and chronic hypoxia have profound effects on endothelial cell cyclooxygenase metabolism and that these effects depend on the duration and degree of the hypoxic exposure and the vascular bed from which the endothelial cells are derived. \nLupron retards proliferation of ovarian epithelial tumor cells cultured in serum-free medium. Some patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer respond favorably to treatment with GnRH agonists. This effect was proposed to be mediated by suppression of pituitary gonadotropin release. The present in vitro study investigated effects of human gonadotropin (Pergonal LH/FSH, 1:1) and Lupron, a GnRH agonist, on proliferation of an ovarian cancer cell line, 2774, which is estrogen receptor negative and grows well in serum-free, defined medium. Pergonal, 10 IU/mL or 30 IU/mL, did not enhance cell proliferation, which argues against stabilization of ovarian tumors in vivo due to decreased serum gonadotropin. Lupron, 1.4 micrograms/mL and 140 micrograms/mL, retarded cell division by day 6-8 of culture, in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric cell cycle phase DNA analysis demonstrated Lupron caused a reversible 5-6% increase in the portion of cells in rest phase, G0/G1, compared to controls during log growth, and a corresponding decrease in the portion of cells in DNA synthesis, S phase. However, long-term culture, 3 weeks, with Lupron failed to arrest cells in G0/G1, and experimental cultures plateaued at cell number similar to control cultures. We conclude Lupron's effect on ovarian cancer cell proliferation is independent of gonadotropin and steroid, involves a cell cycle regulatory event, and duration of benefit observed in vivo for some patients may be related to total tumor volume at the time of treatment. \nMechanism of analgesia induced by hypnosis and acupuncture: is there a difference? Hypnosis and acupuncture can alleviate experimentally induced pain but the mechanism of analgesia remains unclear for both techniques. Experimental pain was induced by cold pressor test (CPT) in 8 male volunteers. Analgesic effect of hypnosis (HA) and acupuncture (AA) was assessed before and after double-blind administration of placebo or naloxone, in a prospective, cross-over study. We found that pain intensity was significantly lower with HA as compared with AA, both with naloxone (P less than 0.001) and placebo (P less than 0.001). Within HA or AA groups, pain scores did not differ significantly when naloxone or placebo was administered. During AA, however, pain scores were similar to control values when naloxone was given (P = 0.05) but decreased significantly with placebo (P less than 0.002). Analog scales for pain intensity and pain relief showed a good correlation (r = 0.94). Plasma levels of beta-endorphins did not change significantly in any combination. Heart rate, peripheral arterial blood pressure and skin conductance were very insensitive indices to assess pain intensity or relief, as well as intensity of acupuncture stimulation or depth of hypnotic trance. We conclude: (1) HA and AA can significantly reduce pain from CPT, and HA is more effective than AA: (2) HA and AA are not primarily mediated by the opiate endorphin system; and (3) plasmatic levels of beta-endorphins are not significantly affected by either HA or AA nor by naloxone or placebo administration. \nMechanisms of asphyxial brain damage, and possible pharmacologic interventions, in the fetus. An examination of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuronal cell damage may lead to the design of pharmacologic interventions during presumed or actual fetal asphyxia. Hypoxia-ischemia in its severest form results in insufficient adenosine 5'-triphosphate production. The most important effect of this is failure of adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent membrane functions, which maintain ionic homeostasis, that is, ionic pumping. There is K+ efflux and Na+ influx across the cell membrane, depolarization of the cell membrane, opening of the voltage-dependent calcium channels, and entrance of Ca++ into the cell. Cytosolic Ca++ is also increased by Ca++ efflux from the mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca++ is a toxin in high cytosolic concentrations; it activates phospholipases A and C, which cause membrane breakdown and release of free fatty acids, including arachidonic acid. The membrane is damaged, lysis occurs, and the neuron dies. High cytosolic Ca++ also causes release of excitatory amino acids (especially glutamate), which overwhelm the suppressant neurotransmitters, causing seizures, increased metabolism, and aggravation of the insufficient adenosine 5'-triphosphate availability. Thromboxane A2 is generated from arachidonic acid, increasing smooth muscle tone and thereby worsening the ischemia. Cyclooxygenase activity also results in formation of oxygen-free radicals that contribute to cell membrane damage, lysis, and death. Possibilities for pharmacologic interventions include (1) calcium channel blockers and antagonists, (2) excitatory neurotransmitter blockers, (3) oxygen-free radical scavengers (e.g., superoxide dismutase), (4) cyclooxygenase or prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, and (5) seizure suppressants (e.g., phenobarbital). Some of these treatments have been shown experimentally to limit neuronal death in the adult and fetus, and after more investigative work they may be applicable to clinical practice. \nThe expression of CD22 (Leu 14) and CD11c (LeuM5) in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders using two-color flow cytometric analysis. The monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) CD22 and CD11c recognize B-lymphocyte- and monocyte-associated antigens, respectively. Reports indicate that when these two MoAbs co-express, they represent a unique marker for hairy cell leukemia (HCL) although neither is specific for that disease. The authors evaluated the expression and diagnostic utility of CD22 and CD11C in specimens from 26 normal subjects, 29 patients, with various nonlymphoproliferative disorders (NLPDs), and 75 patients with different types of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLDs) using two-color flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Lymphocytes co-expressed CD22 and CD11c in less than or equal to 3% of the normal subjects and in less than or equal to 6% of the patients with NLPDs. These markers were expressed in greater than 10% of the lymphocytes of 46% (32/69) of the patients with B-cell CLDs: B-cell chronic-lymphocytic leukemia, 9/41; B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 8/14; HCL, 11/11; B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (NOS), 1/2; and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, 1/1. None (0/6) of the lymphocytes of patients with T-cell CLDs expressed greater than 10% CD22-positive (CD22+) or CD11c-positive (CD11c+) cells. The HCL cases demonstrated a unique CD22+CD11c+ fluorescence histogram pattern, distinct from other lymphoproliferative disorders, that was characterized by uniformly intense CD11c and CD22 fluorescence. Differences in the expression of the CD22+CD11C- and CD22+CD11C+ phenotypes between diagnostic groups were found, most notable was a paucity of CD22+CD11c+ cells in lymphocytes of patients with HCL. CD22 also had more variable expression than CD19 and HLA-DR in the cases of B-cell CLD. This study demonstrates that the CD22+CD11c+ phenotype is not unique to HCL but is a consistent feature of that disorder and that the immunofluorescence pattern of co-expression in HCL is diagnostically useful. \nBenign recurrence of a pilocytic cerebellar astrocytoma 36 years after radical removal: case report. A benign recurrence of a cerebellar juvenile astrocytoma was found in a 52-year-old woman 36 years after the initial radical removal, which was performed when she was 16 years of age. To our knowledge, this is the third detailed case report of the late benign recurrence of cerebellar astrocytoma after total removal. The problem of recurrence of cerebellar astrocytoma is reviewed. \nRecurrent mild abruptio placentae occurring immediately after repeated electroconvulsive therapy in pregnancy. We present a case in which electroconvulsive therapy was performed repeatedly in pregnancy because of severe depression with psychotic features and failure of chemical treatment. Each electroconvulsive treatment was immediately followed by uterine contractions and active uterine bleeding, possibly representing recurrent abruptio placentae occurring in association with the treatment. Transient acute episodes of maternal hypertension between 180/90 and 190/100 mm Hg, documented within minutes after application of each electroconvulsive treatment, might explain the abruptio placentae manifested by active uterine bleeding and uterine hyperstimulation. \nLong-latency neurodegenerative disease in the western Pacific. The western Pacific parkinsonism-dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis complex is a prototypical neurodegenerative disorder found among inhabitants of Guam, New Guinea (Irian Jaya, Indonesia) and Japan (Kii Peninsula, Honshu). Nonviral environmental factors peculiar to the affected populations seem to play a prominent etiologic role. Although cause-effect relationships cannot be established by epidemiologic studies alone, we have shown in all three affected population groups that individuals develop the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis variant of this disorder after heavy exposure to the raw or incompletely detoxified seed of neurotoxic cycad plants. Since long periods may elapse between cycad exposure and the appearance of neurological disease in humans, cycads may harbor a \"slow toxin\" that causes the postmitotic neuron to undergo slow irreversible degeneration. Two cycad neurotoxins are recognized, one of which (cycasin) is known to have long-latency effects (tumorigenesis) on mitotic neurons and replicating cells in other tissues. This paper explores the possible relationship between tumorigenesis and long-latency neurotoxicity, and discusses possible biologic markers of cycad exposure and subclinical neurodegenerative disease. \nInterleukin 4 suppresses the spontaneous growth of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cells. We studied the effects of IL-4 on the spontaneous proliferation of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) cells in vitro. IL-4 (100 U/ml) suppressed the spontaneous DNA synthesis by approximately 50% in 5 of 8 cases examined. IL-4 (100 U/ml) also inhibited the spontaneous colony formation by CMMoL cells in a methylcellulose culture by 50-97% in all of the 10 cases in which spontaneous colonies were formed. This IL-4-mediated suppression of the growth of CMMoL cells was completely abolished by the addition of anti-IL-4 neutralizing antibodies. The spontaneous CMMoL colonies were substantially suppressed by the addition of either anti-IL-6 or anti-granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies to the colony assay system: the addition of both anti-IL-6 and anti-GM-CSF antibodies resulted in greater than 80% inhibition of the colony formation by CMMoL cells. On the other hand, none of anti-IL-1-beta, anti-granulocyte-CSF, anti-macrophage-CSF, or anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibodies affected the CMMoL colony formation. In the supernatants from 24-h cultures of CMMoL cells, high levels of IL-6 and GM-CSF were demonstrated in 9 of 9 and 2 of 9 cases examined, respectively. IL-4 (100 U/ml) almost completely inhibited the secretion of IL-6 and GM-CSF by CMMoL cells. These observations suggest that IL-4 suppresses the spontaneous proliferation of CMMoL cells by inhibiting their production of IL-6 and/or GM-CSF, both of which could act in vitro as an autocrine growth factor for CMMoL cells. \nA cell cycle-responsive transcriptional control element and a negative control element in the gene encoding DNA polymerase alpha in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcription of the POL1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes DNA polymerase alpha, the DNA polymerase required for the initiation of DNA replication, has previously been shown to be cell cycle regulated. To understand how the POL1 gene senses cell cycle position, we have investigated the cis-acting elements that respond to the factors that govern cell cycle progression. In this report we demonstrate that a region of 54 nucleotides containing the repeated element ACGCGT, which conforms to an Mlu I restriction endonuclease recognition site, contains all information necessary for transcriptional activation and cell cycle responsiveness. Although oligonucleotides lacking either one or both of the repeated Mlu I sites can function as an upstream activating sequence, the presence of at least one Mlu I site stimulates expression and, moreover, is absolutely essential for cell cycle regulation. A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to a 19-base-pair sequence in the POL1 promoter containing one Mlu I site can function as an autonomous cell cycle-responsive upstream element (upstream activation sequence) with temporal regulation indistinguishable from that previously described for the POL1 gene. Thus, the Mlu I site is an essential part of a cis-acting element responsible for the observed periodic activation. This sequence differs from previously defined cell cycle-responsive transcriptional control elements in the yeast HO endonuclease and histone genes. We also present evidence for a negative regulatory element in the 5' flanking region of the Mlu I upstream activation sequence. \nResolution of chronic pelvic pain after laparoscopic lysis of adhesions. Thirty women undergoing laparoscopic lysis of adhesions for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain were prospectively evaluated for the presence of a chronic pain syndrome. At follow-up, of those with chronic pain syndrome (10), four (40%) reported continued improvement or resolution of pain during daily activities of dyspareunia, whereas of those without chronic pain syndrome (20), 15 (75%) were better (p = 0.06). When these two complaints are evaluated individually, both pain during daily activities (p less than 0.05) and dyspareunia (p less than 0.05) are more likely to improve after lysis of adhesions in women without chronic pain syndrome. Prognosis was not related to the number of previous operations, adhesion score, or other physical parameters. Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions is generally worthwhile in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain, although the presence of psychosocial compromise warrants preoperative evaluation and concomitant treatment. \nColectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. A prospective trial of optimal antibiotic management. The ideal prophylactic antibiotic regimen has not been established for patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and endorectal ileoanal anastomosis, a prolonged operation frequently accompanied by abdominal and pelvic contamination and associated with an infection rate up to 20%. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion, the efficacy of a short perioperative course compared to an extended postoperative course of intravenous antibiotics (cefoxitin) in patients undergoing colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis. Forty patients with ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis coli received a mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation and a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous cefoxitin. Patients then were randomized to receive intravenous cefoxitin, 1 g every 6 hours, or placebo for 5 days. No differences in overall postoperative morbidity were observed and neither group developed intra-abdominal, pelvic, or wound infections. It is concluded that a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous antibiotics provides adequate prophylaxis in the prevention of infectious complications in patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileoanal anastomosis. \nPatient activity, sports participation, and impact loading on the durability of cemented total hip replacements. Patients with either cemented surface replacements or cemented stemmed hip prostheses and who regularly participate in sporting activities or heavy labor after total joint arthroplasty are at twice the long-term risk of requiring revision surgery for loosening as patients who are less active. For patients with surface replacement total hip arthroplasty (THA), the adverse effects of activity are greatest in patients with preoperative diagnoses other than osteoarthritis, and were seen by the sixth year postsurgery. For patients with conventional stemmed prostheses, the effects of patient activity are not seen until about ten years postsurgery. For resurfacing THA for osteoarthritis, the long-term of loosening is primarily in patients who participate in high impact activities. \nPresenting features and prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in younger adults. We have analyzed 117 younger patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (mean age, 44.5 years; SD, 4.8; range, 19 to 49; male/female ratio, 2.08) with three main objectives: (1) to see whether these patients have distinctive presenting clinical features; (2) to investigate the impact of the disease on survival; and (3) to analyze whether already well-known prognostic factors are also useful when applied to these patients. As compared with an older age population (greater than or equal to 50 years), there were no major differences in presenting features except for an increased proportion of males (2.08 v 1.21; P less than .025) and a higher hemoglobin level (13.47 +/- 2.70 g/dL v 12.84 +/- 2.77 g/dL; P less than .05) in the younger group. Median survival is 12.3 years (expected median from a control group, 31.2 years). Clinical stages, bone marrow patterns, blood lymphocyte counts, and its doubling time are all useful to separate different risk groups of patients. Whereas patients with favorable prognostic factors have a survival probability of about 80% 14 years after diagnosis, those with poor prognostic features have a median survival of less than 3 years. It is concluded that CLL in younger adults has no major distinctive presenting features and that known prognostic factors are useful to separate different risk groups of patients. These results should be of help in planning therapy for younger persons with CLL. \nLong-term efficacy and safety of terazosin alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents. This open, multicenter phase III study was designed to assess the efficacy and long-term safety of terazosin (1 to 40 mg/day), alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, in 364 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Compared with baseline values, long-term terazosin monotherapy or combination therapy resulted in consistent decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, with a mean reduction in supine diastolic pressure of 12 to 14 mm Hg. The numbers of patients with controlled blood pressure at the last evaluable visit of each therapy period were as follows: terazosin alone, 106 of 245 (43%); terazosin with added diuretic, 70 of 112 (63%); diuretic with added terazosin, 47 of 88 (53%); and terazosin plus diuretic with added beta-blocker, 22 of 32 (69%). Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Only pain in extremities had a higher incidence during long-term treatment (6%, 181 to 360-day period) than during initial short-term treatment (5%, 1 to 90-day period). Three of six syncopal events occurred during the initial 180 days of treatment; this 0.8% (3/364) incidence was comparable with that reported previously for short-term studies. Only one case of syncope occurred during terazosin monotherapy. Terazosin was judged to be a safe and effective long-term medication for the treatment of hypertension. \nThe \"make/break test\" as a diagnostic tool in functional weakness. Strength was measured in four major muscle groups with a hand-held dynamometer. The \"make\" and \"break\" technique was used with and without encouragement, and fatiguability was tested in patients with organic weakness and patients with functional weakness. Patients with functional weakness could be distinguished from the other two groups by an increase in strength greater than 20% with the break compared with the make technique. Additionally they tend to show larger increases in strength with encouragement and their \"fatiguability\" was less. \nEnhanced detection of the t(14;18) translocation in malignant lymphoma using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation that results in the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene with the heavy chain JH locus is a common cytogenetic abnormality in human lymphoma. In particular, it is seen in about 85% of follicular lymphoma (FL) and up to one-third of diffuse lymphomas (DL). The chromosome 18 breakpoints have been shown to cluster into two regions. The major breakpoint region (mbr) within the 3' untranslated region of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene accounts for approximately 60% of the cases and the minor cluster region (mcr) 30 kb 3' of bcl-2 accounts for approximately 25% of the breakpoints. Because of variability in the position of the breakpoint, detection of the t(14;18) by Southern blot analysis provides an important clonal marker for the tumor. However, conventional electrophoresis (CE) fails to detect the translocation in 15% to 25% of cases. We have applied pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to the detection of the t(14;18) in a series of lymphoma prospectively analyzed by CE, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and cytogenetic analysis. PFGE readily detected t(14;18) rearrangements as indicated by comigration of bands detected with probes for the mbr region (chromosome 18) and the JH locus (chromosome 14). In a series of 40 patients with FL, this method proved to be the most comprehensive for detection of the translocation compared with standard methods; in fact, in one case only PFGE was able to detect the chromosomal rearrangement. Ten percent of the FL cases were negative by all methods tested. In a separate analysis of matched tissue specimens from cases of tumor progression of FL to diffuse lymphoma, PFGE detected a common t(14;18) rearrangement confirming a clonal origin in seven of seven cases, whereas CE detected a rearrangement in only three of seven cases. Overall, PFGE was able to detect a translocation in 8 of 12 cases that were negative by CE and four of eight negative by cytogenetic analysis. In conclusion, PFGE analysis is more comprehensive than CE, PCR, and cytogenetic analysis for the detection of the t(14;18) breakpoint in tissue biopsies of malignant lymphoma. \nSmall bowel tumours: yield of enteroscopy. A total of 258 patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding were referred for small bowel enteroscopy, a procedure which allows endoscopic evaluation of most of the small intestine. A small bowel tumour was found in 5% of patients. In 50% of patients no diagnosis could be made, but when the cause of obscure bleeding was discovered small bowel tumours were the single most common lesion in patients younger than 50 years. Small bowel tumours causing gastrointestinal bleeding may remain undetected despite extensive diagnostic evaluation. We conclude that small bowel tumours are the most common cause of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in patients less than 50 years of age. Small bowel enteroscopy is diagnostic of small bowel tumours even when all previous diagnostic studies, including enteroclysis and angiography, are negative. \nEffect of DN-1417 on photosensitivity and cortically kindled seizure in Senegalese baboons, Papio papio. The effect of DN-1417, a thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) analogue, on photosensitivity and cortically kindled seizures was examined in seven Senegalese baboons (Papio papio). Intravenous (i.v.) administration of 2 mg/kg had no effect on either photosensitivity or cortically kindled seizures. When this agent was administered intracisternally, both the photomyoclonic response and cortically kindled seizures were suppressed for 4-5 days. A study of the transcallosal response also showed a long-lasting attenuation of the early positive wave (P1) amplitude (peak latency, 5-10 ms) elicited by a single stimulus after cisternal injection of DN-1417. These findings are consistent with the assumption that endogenous TRH is involved in suppression of epileptic seizures. \nComparison of extradural and intravenous diamorphine as a supplement to extradural bupivacaine. The influence of route of administration (extradural as compared with intravenous) of diamorphine 0.5 mg/hour as a supplement to extradural bupivacaine (0.125% at 15 ml/hour) was investigated in two groups of 20 patients who underwent major abdominal gynaecological surgery. Significantly more patients in the intravenous group withdrew because of inadequate analgesia (p less than 0.05). Those in the extradural group were significantly more drowsy throughout the study (p less than 0.01), but no major side effects were encountered. \nExtracranial-intracranial bypass to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. Extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery is an operative procedure in which the superficial temporal artery is anastomosed to the middle cerebral artery. The operation, first described in 1969, was employed to circumvent otherwise surgically inaccessible atherosclerotic lesions high in the internal carotid system or in the middle cerebral artery. This assessment compares the findings from 13 surgical series of EC-IC bypass (1464 patients) with those reported in the only prospective, randomized, cooperative trial of this procedure (1377 patients). Analysis of the outcomes in the 1464 patients included in the surgical series produced insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that post-EC-IC bypass stroke rates were lower than the rates of either the medically or surgically treated groups in the controlled clinical trial. In the absence of reliable, objective evidence of the existence of a group of patients in whom surgical intervention is superior to medical treatment in reducing the frequency of stroke, the results of the single controlled clinical trial, which demonstrated no benefit of bypass, must be accepted as the best evidence currently available. \nImportance of experimental models for the development of clinical trials on thromboatherosclerosis. Experimental models of vascular injury have enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiological process leading to vascular obstruction in both spontaneous and accelerated atherosclerosis. Based on experimental findings, we present and discuss a pathological classification of vascular injury or damage and its role in the pathogenesis of various vascular diseases. In addition, these animal models have provided insights into the roles of platelets and lipid metabolism in the evolution and progression of atherosclerosis and have suggested potential therapeutic applications. Thus, based on studies in the pig models, antiplatelet agents have been shown for the first time to have a beneficial effect in preventing the formation and progression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in humans. Similarly, our findings in high density lipoprotein plasma fractions regarding inhibition and even reversal of the process of atherosclerosis in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model have added new insights to an explosive field of lipoprotein research and provided new avenues of therapeutic strategies. our in vivo and ex vivo pig models of an extracorporeal perfusion chamber mimicking the various coronary conditions have aided in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the acute coronary syndromes and intensified our search for the ideal antithrombotic regimen in these high-risk patients. Finally, a carotid pig model of balloon angioplasty, a dog model of saphenous vein grafting, and a pig model of heart transplantation not only have provided insights into the pathophysiological process of accelerated atherosclerosis but also are allowing development of new antithrombotic and antiproliferative approaches for the prevention of these accelerated vascular diseases. In summary, we are entering an exciting era in vascular research. Significant advances in our understanding of vascular injury or damage as well as the interactions of blood cells and lipids with the vascular wall have allowed us to formulate new experimental strategies with subsequent clinical application in the prevention and progression of these vascular diseases. \nDifferentiation-inducing cytokine P48 exists in a membrane-associated form. P48 is a recently described 48-kDa differentiation-inducing cytokine isolated from the culture medium of the human leukemia line Reh. P48 induces differentiation and cytolytic activity in the promyelocytic cell line HL-60, and stimulates the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1 from peripheral blood monocytes. In further studies designed to examine the biosynthesis and function of P48, surface immunofluorescence flow cytometry analysis as well as 125I surface labeling and immunoprecipitation, revealed the presence of P48 on the surface of Reh cells. Triton X-114-treated Reh cells were partitioned into detergent and aqueous phases and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis revealed that P48 partitioned exclusively into the detergent phase, suggesting an integral membrane association. Reh cells fixed with paraformaldehyde, but not K562 or P815, were able to stimulate the release of TNF-alpha from peripheral blood monocytes in a manner similar to that of secreted P48. Isolated plasma membranes from Reh cells could also stimulate TNF-alpha release. This TNF-alpha-releasing activity could be removed from detergent solubilized Reh membranes by immunoaffinity chromatography on an anti-P48 column. This study suggests that, in addition to being secreted into the culture medium, P48 is expressed on the surface of Reh cells in a biologically active form. The membrane form of P48 may be 1) a final maturation step before secretion or 2) a cell membrane-associated form that may be analogous to the membrane forms of TNF-alpha and IL-1. \nA meta-analysis of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease. BACKGROUND.--Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), defined as either isolated hypertension after the 20th week of gestation or hypertension with proteinuria (preeclampsia), occurs in 5% to 15% of pregnancies and is associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity. Previous clinical trials with small numbers of patients have suggested that aspirin in doses of 60 to 150 mg/d during the second and third trimesters reduces the risk of PIH and improves maternal and neonatal outcomes. OBJECTIVE.--We performed a meta-analysis of the six published controlled trials to estimate more precisely (1) the magnitude of protection of aspirin from PIH; (2) the effect of aspirin on severe low-birth-weight infants, cesarean section, and perinatal mortality; and (3) the risk of adverse effects. METHODS.--We critically and independently evaluated study methods, assigned a quality score to each trial, and abstracted quantitative outcomes data. For each outcome, both relative risk (RR) and the number needed to be treated were calculated. RESULTS.--Among 394 subjects from six trials, the RR of PIH among women who took aspirin was 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.55) and the number needed to be treated was 4.4, meaning that between four and five high-risk women would need to be treated with aspirin to prevent one case of PIH. Aspirin reduced the risk of severe low birth weight among newborns by 44% (RR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.88) and reduced the risk of cesarean section by 66% overall (RR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.48), although the specific indications for cesarean section were generally not described. There was no effect on fetal and neonatal death (RR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.32 to 2.46), and there were no maternal or neonatal adverse effects associated with taking aspirin. CONCLUSION.--This meta-analysis suggests that low-dose aspirin reduces the risks of PIH and severe low birth weight, with no observed risk of maternal or neonatal adverse effects. \nRelief of right ventricular angina and increased exercise capacity with long-term oxygen therapy. Long-term low-flow oxygen therapy can lead to improved exercise capacity and improved hemodynamics in selected patients with pulmonary hypertension. We report a patient who presented with severe exercise limitation and anginal chest pain that appeared to result from pulmonary hypertension and predominantly right ventricular ischemia. Acute oxygen therapy led to relief of pain but no change in exercise capacity or of pulmonary hypertension. After eight months of oxygen therapy, the patient's pulmonary hypertension was unchanged, but right ventricular hypertrophy and marked increases in exercise cardiac output and exercise capacity developed. Thus, oxygen can relieve right ventricular angina and facilitate the development of compensatory hypertrophy. \nLocalization of gene for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to chromosome 14q1 in a diverse US population. BACKGROUND. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an inherited primary cardiac abnormality characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, is the leading cause of sudden death in the young. Recent application of restriction fragment length polymorphism markers has provided provocative results, with localization to chromosome 18 (Japanese studies), 16 (Italian studies), 14 (US and French-Canadian studies), and two (National Institutes of Health studies) indicating genetic heterogeneity. Interpretation remains speculative until at least one of these loci is confirmed in unrelated pedigrees by independent investigators. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied eight unrelated families of varied ethnic origins across the United States. DNA from each individual was digested with restriction enzymes TaqI or BamHI and analyzed by Southern blots followed by hybridization with probes T cell receptor alpha (TCRA), myosin heavy chain beta, D14S25, and D14S26. Multipoint linkage analysis showed a maximum lod score of 4.3, placing the locus 10 cM from D14S26 between D14S26 and TCRA, with an odds ratio of 20,000:1 and 90% confidence limits of 12 cM proximal to D14S25 to 4 cM distal to TCRA. The probability of linkage to 14q1 was more than 99%. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that the loci for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in our families is primarily 14q1 but does not exclude other loci in a small proportion of the families. Thus, 14q1 appears to be the locus for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a significant proportion of the US population. \nCaffeine self-administration, withdrawal, and adverse effects among coffee drinkers. Twenty-two coffee drinkers (three to seven cups per day) underwent repeated double-blind trials to test for caffeine self-administration, withdrawal, and adverse effects. Each trial consisted first of a randomized crossover period of 1 day of decaffeinated coffee and 1 day of caffeinated coffee (100 mg) to assess withdrawal and adverse effects of caffeine. Next, subjects were given 2 days of concurrent access to the two coffees. The",
