        "text": "all degrees of severity, including left ventricular dysfunction and end-stage heart failure. Part of the damage that may occur with acute myocardial infarction, particularly in this era of thrombolysis therapy, is reperfusion injury, which may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals. Better knowledge of the mechanisms and treatment of myocardial infarction, the leading cause of congestive heart failure, may help prevent or attenuate the development of this syndrome. \nManagement of severe fibrocystic disease of the breast with leuprolide acetate. Symptoms of severe fibrocystic disease of the breast were successfully ameliorated in two patients as a result of treatment with daily subcutaneous LA without adverse effects. A state of drug-induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism appears to be responsible for the clinical effect and is further suggestive of the hormonal dependence of this common disorder. \nSafety of surgical procedures performed by residents. The outcome of surgical procedures on the gallbladder performed by surgical residents in a university hospital was compared with the outcome of those performed by the attending staff. More than 60% of the operations (643/1084) were done by residents under the direct supervision of the attending surgeon. We found no differences in the rate of technical complications, postoperative morbidity and mortality, or length of hospitalization between the two groups. Thus, resident surgery under appropriate guidance is safe and does not compromise the quality of patient care or operative outcome. \nChickenpox pneumonia, its complications and management. A report of three cases, including the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We report three cases of chickenpox pneumonia in adults, all of whom required intermittent positive pressure ventilation. One patient developed a variety of complications, and another, a pregnant woman, required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. \nAcetylcholine regulates pancreastatin secretion from the human pancreastatin-producing cell line (QGP-1N). Studies were made of pancreastatin (PST) secretion from a human PST-producing cell line (QGP-1N) in response to various secretagogues. Cells with immunoreactivity for PST were observed in monolayer cultures of QGP-1N cells. Carbachol stimulated PST secretion and the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization concentration dependently in the range of 10(-6)-10(-4) M. The PST secretion and Ca2+ mobilization induced by carbachol were inhibited by atropine. The calcium ionophore (A23187) stimulated PST secretion. However, cholecystokinin and gastrin-releasing peptide did not stimulate either PST secretion or Ca2+ mobilization. Secretin also did not stimulate PST secretion. The glucose concentration in the culture medium had no effect on PST secretion. These results suggest that PST secretion is mainly regulated by acetylcholine through a muscarinic receptor, and that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ plays an important role in stimulus-secretion coupling in QGP-1N cells. \nDelayed visual loss due to trauma of the internal carotid artery. The group of six patients in this study experienced delayed visual loss following head trauma. Visual loss occurred from 1 day to 13 years after the initial injury. All patients suffered indirect trauma to the internal carotid artery resulting in formation of either an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm or a carotid-cavernous fistula. Review of the radiologic and clinical findings was performed in six patients. The diagnosis was established by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography. All patients had follow-up clinical evaluation and imaging studies. Treatment by neurosurgical or interventional neuroradiologic procedures resulted in significant visual improvement in five patients. Different pathophysiologic mechanisms could be correlated with the delayed visual loss produced by the two types of lesions. The pathologic changes associated with the aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms included direct compression of optic nerves and/or chiasm and intracranial hematoma. A carotid-cavernous fistula caused delayed visual loss by either hematoma at the orbital apex or compression of the chiasm and/or optic nerves by saccular dilatation of the cavernous sinus. The delayed onset of decreased vision following head trauma should alert the physician to the possibility of a traumatic aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm or a carotid-cavernous fistula. Different neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms can usually be correlated with the pathologic changes demonstrated by neuroimaging procedures. \nClinical and angiographic observations on resuscitated victims of exercise-related sudden ischemic death. The clinical and angiographic findings of 17 resuscitated victims of exercise-related sudden ischemic death are reported in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism(s) of these deaths. Ten survivors developed cardiac arrest during or after sporting activities (group A) and 7 others during or after an exercise stress test (group B). There were 15 men and 2 women. The mean age of group A was 46 years and of group B 55 years. Coronary risk factors, as well as previous angina and myocardial infarction, were more frequent in group B. Only 3 of the 17 survivors had anginal symptoms before sudden death. Sudden death in group A was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 8 and unstable angina in 2 and was associated in group B with acute myocardial infarction in 2, unstable angina in 3 and silent ischemia in 2. Coronary angiography was acutely performed in 15 patients. In most patients the ischemia-related coronary artery was totally or subtotally occluded. Clinical and angiographic findings indicate that exercise-related sudden ischemic death was due to an acute coronary event--in most cases unexpected and unpredictable. It is suggested that exercise-induced intracoronary changes were probably responsible for the development of acute coronary (sub)occlusion and sudden death. \nEstablishment from Shope carcinoma induced in an inbred rabbit of culture cell lines with various potentials for differentiation and tumorigenicity. Shope papillomas induced by cottontail rabbit papilloma-virus (CRPV) in domestic rabbits frequently regress spontaneously or, failing to do so, convert into squamous cell carcinomas at a high rate. This papilloma-carcinoma complex in rabbits provides an experimental model for human papillo-mavirus-associated malignancies. The aim of this study was to prepare an experimental system in inbred rabbits by establishing culture cell lines of the tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma developed from a Shope papilloma that had been induced 6 months previously by inoculating CRPV into an inbred B/J rabbit. By in vitro culturing of the tumor cells, cell lines with potentials for terminal differentiation and tumorigenicity were established. Cloning yielded sublines that varied in these potentials and possessed episomal and integrated CRPV genomes as revealed by Southern hybridization in both one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Major CRPV-specific transcripts were similarly observed both in well-differentiated and in poorly differentiated sublines. Immunofluorescence with syngeneic rabbit antibody against tumor-specific antigens localized such antigens mainly in the nuclei of the cells of these sublines. This experimental system allows experiments that were not feasible in randomly bred rabbits. \nAccess to neurological care for minorities. Minority groups comprise a major segment of the estimated more than 34 million Americans without insurance coverage and also the underinsured. Neurologic disease and neurologic complications of the major causes of morbidity and mortality affect minorities protracted by limited access to health care. Hypertension, a major cause of stroke in the black population, is just one example of the impact of accessibility to intervention in central nervous system disease. Health statistics note the persisting gap between minority groups and the nation's norms for life expectancy. Aging America and particularly black elderly women, combined with the lagging infant mortality among minority groups, demonstrate limited access issues beyond economics, reflecting inner city mores, cultural barriers, and communication delay limiting contact with the practicing neurologist. Awareness of such access limitations to neurological care for minorities demands the attention of the practicing neurologist and the neurological societies. \nNeurological disease in xeroderma pigmentosum. Documentation of a late onset type of the juvenile onset form. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive, neurocutaneous disorder characterized by sunlight-induced skin cancers and defective DNA repair. Many XP children develop a primary neuronal degeneration. We describe 2 unusual XP patients who had a delayed onset of XP neurological disease. Somatic cell genetic studies indicated that they have the same defective DNA repair gene and are both in XP complementation group A. These 2 patients, together with a group A patient previously reported from London, establish as a distinct clinical entity the late onset type of the juvenile onset form of XP neurological disease. The functional capacity of these patients' cultured fibroblast strains to survive after treatment with ultraviolet radiation indicates that their DNA repair defect is less severe than that of typical group A patients who have a more severe neurodegeneration with an earlier symptomatic onset. The premature death of nerve cells in XP patients (which is presumably due to their inherited defects in DNA repair mechanisms) suggests that normal repair of damaged DNA in neurons is required to maintain integrity of the human nervous system. \nBrain stem atrophy in Joseph disease: a morphometric study using two-dimensional (area) measurement by computed tomography. Eight Japanese patients with Joseph disease were studied using computed tomography (CT). Morphometric analysis using the two-dimensional (area) measurement by CT was performed in the infratentorial region. The brain-stem index, an index of brain-stem atrophy or pontine atrophy, revealed a significant decrease (P less than 0.01), with a mean of 66.7% when compared with 16 control subjects. The patients showed a significant increase (P less than 0.01), with a mean of three times that of the controls in the fourth ventricular index, an index of fourth ventricular dilatation. There were no differences in the cerebellar index, an index of cerebellar atrophy, between these patients and the controls, although the patients had an increased number of visible cerebellar vermian (2.0, SD 0.7) and hemispheric sulci (2.6 SD 0.6) as compared with the controls (vermian sulci: 0.4, SD 0.7: hemispheric sulci: 0). These data indicate severe pontine atrophy, fourth ventricular dilatation with mild involvement of the cerebellum and correlate well with the common pathological features of Joseph disease. The present morphometric evaluation by CT may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of Joseph disease. \nThe incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in women undergoing laparoscopy is influenced by the day of menstrual cycle. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a major cause of postoperative morbidity. It can lead to increased recovery time, delaying patient discharge and an increase in hospital costs. Past studies have shown that postoperative nausea and vomiting is more frequent in women than men, appears to elevate around the time of menarche and is reduced around the time of menopause. This retrospective review of a one-year experience of laparoscopic tubal ligation at our institute examined the effect of menstrual cycle on postoperative nausea and vomiting. The anaesthetic and surgical techniques were consistent for all patients. Patient data included age, weight, last day of menstrual cycle, the length of anaesthetic, the dose of inhalational agent, the dose of narcotic, emesis on emergence and whether or not droperidol was used. Of the the 235 patients in the study, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 28%. One hundred fifty-eight had had no preoperative antiemetic and 77 had received droperidol. These two groups were analyzed separately. The incidence in the group not receiving droperidol was 33.5% and in the droperidol group, 16.9% (P less than 0.01). The incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher on the first eight menstrual days (51.6 vs 21.6, P less than 0.001), was highest on day five of the menstrual cycle and lowest on days 18, 19, and 20 where there was no nausea and vomiting. Droperidol reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting but the variation in postoperative nausea and vomiting during the cycle persisted. \nBio-medicus ventricular assist device for salvage of cardiac surgical patients Over a 5-year period, 41 (1%) of 4,193 patients undergoing cardiac operations underwent intraoperative or early postoperative insertion of a Bio-Medicus ventricular assist device when it became apparent that the patient could not otherwise survive. Fourteen patients were in cardiogenic shock and 7 were in cardiac arrest at the time of initiation of their primary cardiac surgical procedure, and in no instance was the device planned as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Bleeding, sepsis, and thromboembolism were frequent postoperative complications. Central nervous system deficits were observed in 16 patients during their postoperative course. Eight patients (19.5%) were long-term survivors. Of the preoperative risk factors evaluated only age was significantly associated with survival, with 7 (33%) of the 21 younger (39 to 63 years) patients surviving. Blood product usage and hospital cost were analyzed in an attempt to assess cost/effectiveness of use of this device for attempted salvage of such desperately ill patients. \nThe applications of PET in clinical oncology. With the advent of a new generation of PET scanners that have introduced whole-body PET to the clinical setting, there is now more interest in developing protocols for the evaluation of both intracranial and somatic cancers. The value of PET in clinical oncology has been demonstrated with studies in a variety of cancers including colorectal carcinomas, lung tumors, head and neck tumors, primary and metastatic brain tumors, breast carcinoma, lymphoma, melanoma, bone cancers, and other soft-tissue cancers. A summary of current clinical applications of PET in oncology is presented with special attention to colorectal, lung, and intracranial neoplasms since the majority of clinical trials have focused on these cancers. A variety of radiopharmaceuticals are described that are currently included in clinical tumor-imaging protocols, including metabolic substrates such as fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and carbon-11-methionine, and analogs of chemotherapeutic agents such as fluorine-18-fluorouracil and fluoroestradiol. An attempt is also made to include examples of clinical trials that demonstrate response to therapeutic intervention. The increasing number of oncologic PET studies reflects the growing interest in functional imaging in oncology. \nCardiopulmonary hemodynamics in systemic sclerosis and response to nifedipine and captopril. PURPOSE: This prospective study was performed to evaluate the response of the cardiopulmonary vasculature to two vasodilators in patients with systemic sclerosis and either minimal or no central hemodynamic abnormalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon (19 of 20 patients), and clinically normal cardiac function underwent right heart catheterization. Rest and exercise hemodynamic measurements, including cardiac output by thermodilution, were performed before and after oral administration of nifedipine 20 mg and captopril 25 mg. RESULTS: Half of the patients had normal hemodynamics (Group A); the other half (Group B) had abnormal baseline elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance and four of them showed \"borderline\" pulmonary arterial hypertension. Group A, with significantly shorter disease duration compared with Group B, responded poorly to nifedipine and captopril. However, Group B had significant decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance (from 148 +/- 20 to normal levels of 94 +/- 21 dynes.second.cm-5) and pulmonary mean pressure in response to nifedipine treatment but not to captopril. CONCLUSION: These observations show a short-term beneficial effect of nifedipine in the cardiopulmonary vasculature of patients with systemic sclerosis and suggest that a potentially reversible vasoconstrictive element is included in the vascular lesion of this disorder. \nSuppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by oral administration of myelin antigens: IV. Suppression of chronic relapsing disease in the Lewis rat and strain 13 guinea pig. Oral administration of proteins is a long-recognized method of inducing antigen-specific peripheral immune tolerance. We previously showed that oral administration of myelin basic protein suppresses monophasic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the Lewis rat when it is given in association with immunization and prior to disease onset. As a potential therapy for human autoimmune disease, it is crucial to determine whether oral tolerance can ameliorate an ongoing immune response. We therefore asked whether oral administration of myelin antigens, after sensitization and disease expression has occurred, could affect immunological, clinical, or pathological features of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in the Lewis rat and strain 13 guinea pig by immunization with whole guinea pig cord homogenate, complete Freund's adjuvant, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Following recovery from the first attack, animals were orally given bovine myelin, guinea pig myelin, or guinea pig myelin basic protein three times per week for up to 3 months. Animals receiving myelin products orally had decreased severity and frequency of clinical relapses, decreased delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to myelin antigens, diminished inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), and decreased areas of CNS demyelination. In the rat, guinea pig myelin basic protein was as effective as guinea pig myelin in ameliorating the disease and also resulted in decreased serum anti-myelin basic protein antibody levels. No exacerbation of disease or worsening of pathological findings occurred in the animals given myelin products. These results demonstrate that oral administration of myelin antigens can suppress chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and have direct relevance to therapy of human demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis. \nIntrahepatic spontaneous arterioportal fistula: duplex ultrasound diagnosis and angiographic treatment. A 54-yr-old male with portal hypertension received ineffective medical therapy for the diagnosis of portal hepatic cirrhosis. Duplex ultrasound (US) revealed pulsatile arterial flow in the right main portal vein. The correct diagnosis of intrahepatic arterioportal fistula was established and confirmed by angiography. Right hepatic artery embolization with three coils was performed. The patient is alive for 16 months after the embolization, and his complaints have disappeared. There has been full resorption of ascites and absence of varices. Nine previously reported similar cases are reviewed. \nFocal hepatic lesions: differentiation with MR imaging at 0.5 T. Magnetic resonance (MR) examinations of 43 patients with 95 focal hepatic lesions (diameter, greater than 1 cm) were analyzed for lesion shape, homogeneity, and relative signal intensity compared with normal liver parenchyma, spleen, and skeletal muscle. On T1-weighted, balanced, and T2-weighted images, most metastases (74%), cavernous hemangiomas (76%), and cysts (82%) were smooth and round or oval, while the hepatocellular carcinomas all had irregular borders (40%) or were lobulated (60%). All lesions with irregular borders were malignant. Seventy percent of metastatic lesions, 85% of cavernous hemangiomas, and 100% of simple hepatic cysts were of homogeneous signal intensity, while 60% of hepatocellular carcinomas were inhomogeneous. Logistic regression analysis of multiple lesion characteristics showed that inhomogeneous lesions had a high likelihood of malignancy, while markedly hyperintense lesions had a very low probability of being malignant, regardless of other traits. Homogeneous lesions that were isointense or hyperintense compared with spleen on balanced images but were not markedly hyperintense on T2-weighted images also had a high likelihood of malignancy. \nStaging relationships and outcome in early stage testicular cancer: a report from the Testicular Cancer Intergroup Study. The Testicular Cancer Center Intergroup Study entered surgically staged patients with nonseminomatous tumor and metastases limited to the regional lymph nodes into a previously reported cooperative trial of immediate versus delayed therapy for positive retroperitoneal node disease. Patients with negative nodes (stage I) were placed in an observation registry with specified treatment strategy upon relapse. Of 264 stage I cancer patients 27 (10.2%) had recurrence: 5 of these 27 patients died after recurrence of the testicular malignancies, while 4 other nontumor-related deaths have occurred. Pre-lymphadenectomy staging characteristics observed to predict significantly node positivity are the results of radiological examinations, presence of tumor invasion, vascular invasion and tumor histology. In a multiple logistic regression analysis with these variables, misclassification still occurs in more than a fourth of the patients. Future refinements in diagnosis may allow for better prediction of these patients at risk to have positive lymph nodes and ultimately recurrence. Presently, if assessment of nodal involvement is the objective, noninvasive procedures are not an adequate substitute for surgical staging with modified lymphadenectomy. \nCrackles in patients with fibrosing alveolitis, bronchiectasis, COPD, and heart failure. We have studied the crackling lung sounds of ten patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, ten with bronchiectasis, ten with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and ten with heart failure by analyzing frequency, waveform, and timing of crackles. The upper frequency limit of inspiratory sounds was higher in CFA than in COPD or in HF. The period of crackling was shorter in COPD than in CFA or BE. Inspiratory crackling terminated significantly earlier in COPD than in CFA, BE, or HF. The initial deflection width and the two-cycle duration of the expanded waveforms of crackles were smaller in CFA than in BE, COPD, or HF. The largest deflection width was smaller in CFA than in BE, HF, or COPD and smaller in BE than in HF. The results indicate that crackling lung sounds in different diseases have distinctive features and that their analysis can be of diagnostic value. \nParkinson's disease: new treatment strategies. Recent interest has focused on two novel approaches to the treatment of Parkinson's disease-medications to slow or arrest disease progression, and cerebral transplantation. Two recent studies have demonstrated that selegiline can slow, although not halt, the progression of recent-onset Parkinson's disease. The data are sufficiently compelling to justify the use of this drug in most new patients. It also seems reasonable to extrapolate from the data and offer this medication to all patients but those with the most advanced Parkinson's disease. The current focus on excessive oxidative stress as a causative factor has led some investigators to recommended treating patients with the antioxidant tocopherol (vitamin E). There is no clinical evidence demonstrating its effectiveness, but a current multicenter study is being conducted, with the results expected within the next 2 years. High-dose vitamin E (such as 800 to 2000 U/d), taken for a number of months, is probably harmless. It is probably reasonable, therefore, to allow patients to take this over-the-counter compound until more definitive evidence is available. Another antioxidant, vitamin C, has also been advocated as a means of slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease. There are no studies that demonstrate any clinical effectiveness, and there are also no ongoing studies investigating this issue in patients with Parkinson's disease. The excitement surrounding the initially favorable results of adrenal-brain transplantation has waned with the failure of numerous institutions to replicate the original dramatic success. While mild or occasionally moderate improvement has been noted in subsequent patients undergoing adrenal-brain transplantation, the improvement has not been sufficient to justify the risk and expense of this surgery. \nObstructive sleep apnea complicating negative-pressure ventilatory support in patients with chronic paralytic/restrictive ventilatory dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and severity of obstructive events and oxyhemoglobin desaturation (dSaO2) in 37 patients with paralytic/restrictive ventilatory insufficiency during use of nocturnal ventilatory assistance provided by means of negative-pressure body ventilators (BVs). Thirteen of the 37 patients had mean oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) less than 95 percent and a mean of ten or more episodes per hour when the dSaO2 was greater than or equal to 4 percent (4%dSaO2/h). In all, 26 of the 37 patients had evidence of significant multiple episodes of dSaO2 while asleep on BVs. Polysomnography performed on three of these patients substantiated the obstructive nature of the dSaO2. Twenty-two of the 37 patients who had a mean SaO2 of 90.6 +/- 7.2 percent and a mean of 17.7 +/- 16.1 4%dSaO2/h on BVs were switched to noninvasive ventilatory assistance by intermittent positive airway pressure (NV-PAP). Their mean SaO2 improved to 96.0 +/- 2.2 percent, and the 4%dSaO2/h decreased to 1.2 +/- 1.8 per hour. All symptoms similar to those of obstructive sleep apnea were relieved. We conclude that BV use is associated with significant dSaO2 in over 50 percent of patients. The dSaO2 is predominantly obstructive in nature but may be due to chronic underventilation in patients using less effective BVs. Patients with a mean SaO2 less than 95 percent or 10 or more 4%dSaO2/h may benefit from conversion to NV-PAP via the nose, the mouth, or an oral-nasal interface. \nRehabilitation in rheumatic diseases. What's new. In the past decade, considerable change has occurred in concepts of rehabilitation in patients with rheumatic diseases. This includes approaches to functional assessment and outcome, new concepts in exercise, and new orthotics. \nFamily history of myocardial infarction and hemodynamic responses to exercise in young black boys. The influence of family history of coronary artery disease on children's hemodynamic responses to exercise was examined with 25 black boys aged 7 to 10 years. Blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance were evaluated during preexercise, peak exercise, and recovery stages. Children with a family history of CAD exhibited greater systolic blood pressure and total peripheral resistance during preexercise and peak exercise stages than did those without a family history of coronary artery disease. After controlling for preexercise differences, the group with a family history of coronary artery disease exhibited greater increases in systolic blood pressure and less attenuation of total peripheral resistance to peak exercise than the group without a family history of coronary artery disease. Cardiac output indexed by body surface area and stroke volumes were higher at all times in the group without a family history compared with the group with a family history of coronary artery disease. Findings are compared with those of adult studies in terms of influence of family history of coronary artery disease on cardiovascular reactivity to stress. \nEmergence of a B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia: evidence for the single-cell origin of the two tumors. A patient is described who presented with a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and later developed a lymphoblastic lymphoma. The cells from the CLL were typical mature B lymphocytes as could be assessed by morphologic, cytochemical, and surface marker analyses. The cells from the lymphoblastic lymphoma were immature B cells that expressed CD10, CD20, and HLA-DR markers, but not surface Ig or cytoplasmic mu chains, and were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). The cells of two continuous cell lines, obtained from the bone marrow and the peripheral blood of the patient, had the same phenotype as the lymphoblastic lymphoma cells, did not contain the Epstein-Barr virus genome, and displayed malignant features in vitro, including the capacity to form colonies in agar. The two cell lines also shared identical chromosomal abnormalities, a finding which suggests that they derived from the same malignant cell already present in vivo. Such chromosomal abnormalities were not seen in the karyotype of the peripheral blood cells at the onset of the disease. Analysis of the Ig heavy chain genes using a DJ-specific probe showed the very same monoclonal rearrangement in the cells from the B-CLL, the lymphoblastic lymphoma and the two cell lines, thus demonstrating their common clonal origin. By contrast, a monoclonal rearrangement of the lambda chain gene locus was found in the B-CLL cells only, a finding consistent with their exclusive capacity to express surface IgM lambda. This patient represents a rare case in whom a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder with mature malignant cells transforms into a lymphoblastic lymphoma characterized by cells frozen at a very early maturational stage. The possible mechanisms leading to such transformation within the same cell clone are discussed. \nPsychological changes accompanying non-pharmacological treatment of chronic headache: the effects of outcome. Several prior studies suggest that non-drug treatment for chronic headache is accompanied by concomitant reductions in patients' anxiety, depression and somatization. It is currently unclear, however, whether such beneficial side effects are a function of degree of headache relief or are due simply to receiving treatment. Most work to date in this area has treated outcome as a dichotomous variable. The present report employed a regression approach which treats outcome (degree of headache relief) as a continuous variable in the study of 149 chronic headache patients and their accompanying psychological changes. Anxiety and depression were significantly reduced for headache patients regardless of degree of headache relief. With somatization, however, degree of headache relief had a significant effect; the greater the reduction in headache, the fewer somatic concerns were expressed, especially for mixed headache. \nExocrine pancreatic function in children with coeliac disease before and after a gluten free diet. This study was designed to determine the extent of pancreatic insufficiency in untreated coeliac disease and whether pancreatic secretion is impaired after a prolonged gluten free period. Three groups of patients were studied: group A comprised 44 patients, mean (SD) age 4.0 (3.1) years, with coeliac disease and total or subtotal atrophy of the intestinal mucosa; group B comprised 67 patients, mean age 4.4 (3.0) years, with coeliac disease but with normal morphology of the intestinal villi (after 12.9 months of a gluten free diet); group C comprised 49 control subjects, mean age 3.2 (3.0) years, with normal jejunal histology. In all subjects exocrine pancreatic function was determined by the secretin-caerulein test; bicarbonate concentration and lipase, phospholipase, and chymotrypsin activity were measured after an intravenous injection of secretin 1 clinical unit (CU) + caerulein 75 ng/kg body weight. Faecal chymotrypsin concentration was also assayed. No significant difference was found between values of the duodenal output of pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonate obtained in the three groups; however, 10 of 44 untreated coeliac patients showed tryptic or lipolytic activity, or both, below the normal limit for our laboratory. The mean value of the faecal chymotrypsin concentration was significantly lower in untreated than in treated coeliac patients (p less than 0.0001) or in control subjects (p less than 0.0001). It is concluded that untreated coeliac patients may have pancreatic deficiency independent of a decrease in enterohormone release. No primary or secondary pancreatic insufficiency was found in coeliac patients where the intestinal mucosa had returned to normal. \nLeft atrial spontaneous echo contrast: a clinical and echocardiographic analysis. The clinical and echocardiographic variables related to left atrial spontaneous echo contrast were prospectively evaluated in a consecutive series of 400 patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography with a 5-MHz single plane transducer. Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast was found in 75 patients (19%) and was significantly associated with atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis, absence of mitral regurgitation, increased left atrial dimension and a history of suspected embolism. Seventy-one (95%) of the patients with spontaneous echo contrast had atrial fibrillation or mitral stenosis. Anticoagulant therapy had no significant association with spontaneous echo contrast. Multivariate analysis in 89 patients with mitral stenosis or mitral valve replacement showed that spontaneous echo contrast was the only independent predictor (p = 0.03) of left atrial thrombus or suspected embolism, or both. In 60 patients with atrial fibrillation of nonvalvular origin, spontaneous echo contrast (p = 0.01) and age (p = 0.03) were the only independent predictors of left atrial thrombus or suspected embolism, or both. It is concluded that left atrial spontaneous echo contrast is 1) a common finding in patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography, 2) associated with conditions favoring stasis of left atrial blood, and 3) a marker of previous thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and those with mitral stenosis or mitral valve replacement. \nResting energy expenditure in patients with newly detected gastric and colorectal cancers. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured in 104 patients with newly detected gastric or colorectal (GCR) cancer and was compared with two groups of control subjects without cancer: healthy subjects (H control subjects) and patients with nonmalignant diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (GI patients). REE in GCR-cancer patients was not significantly different from REE in GI patients or H control subjects. Comparison of measured REE with predicted REE obtained from prediction equations may erroneously suggest that increased REE is a contributing factor in the development of cancer cachexia. No significant differences in REE were found when patients with liver metastases were compared with patients without metastases. There were no differences in REE between gastric and colorectal cancer patients. The decrease in energy expenditure, which normally occurs during starvation and weight loss in healthy men and women, could not be demonstrated in weight-losing, GCR-cancer patients. In conclusion, elevation of REE contributes little to the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia in GCR-cancer patients. \nComparative efficacy of short-term versus long-term cefoxitin prophylaxis against postoperative infection after radical hysterectomy: a prospective study. We report the results of a randomized, double-blind comparison of short-term versus long-term cefoxitin prophylaxis against infections after radical abdominal hysterectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Of 113 evaluable patients, 54 (47.8%) received short-term (three doses) and 59 (52.2%) long-term (12 doses) prophylaxis with intravenous cefoxitin (2 g per dose). No significant differences in demographics, preoperative risk factors, or clinical course were detected between the two groups; nor did we detect significant differences in the incidence of surgical-site-related infections (7.4 versus 5.1%, respectively, P = .61), postoperative urinary tract infection, or other febrile morbidity. We conclude that short-term and long-term cefoxitin prophylaxis are equally effective for the prevention of post-operative surgical-site-related infections after radical hysterectomy. \nIntravenous carboplatin for recurrent malignant glioma: a phase II study. Thirty patients with recurrent malignant glioma were treated with intravenous (IV) carboplatin (CBDCA) every 4 weeks at a starting dose of 400 mg/m2 escalating to 450 mg/m2. All patients had documented recurrent tumor after prior radiotherapy but had not received prior chemotherapy. Of 29 assessable patients, four (14%) responded to the treatment for 44, 51+, 72, and 91 weeks; 10 (34%) achieved stable disease (S); while 15 (52%) had progressive disease (P). The total response (responses plus S) rate was 48%, with a median time to progression (MTP) of 26 weeks in these patients; the MTP for all 29 patients was 11 weeks. The toxic effects were mainly hematologic, with thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia being mild at 400 mg/m2 and 450 mg/m2 doses. NO neurotoxicity or renal toxicity was encountered. These results suggest that CBCDA given at 400 mg/m2 or 450 mg/m2 every 4 weeks is marginally active in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. Since hematologic toxicity is mild, a higher dose could possibly be given, and may increase the response rate. \nAutologous fibrin gel: bactericidal properties in contaminated hepatic injury. Fibrin glue is an effective hemostatic agent in a variety of clinical situations; its utility is limited by potential transmission of viral infection. We studied the bactericidal properties of fibrin gel (FG) in a murine contaminated hepatic injury model and in vitro by agar plate culture method. Intra-abdominal abscess formation and adhesion rate were assessed following controlled liver injury in association with abdominal contamination with 10(7) Bacteroides fragilis and hepatorrhaphy (H, n = 15) or FG (n = 12). Animals treated by hepatorrhaphy had a significantly greater intra-abdominal abscess rate (15/15 vs. 4/12, p less than 0.05) and adhesion rate (14/15 vs. 6/12, p less than 0.05) than animals treated with FG. Fibrin gel is bactericidal to Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter faecium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus but has no effect against Klebsiella pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the plasma component appears active. Fibrin gel demonstrates significant improvement in adhesion formation and intra-abdominal abscess rate when compared with suture hepatorrhaphy. Fibrin gel appears protective in contaminated hepatic injury. \nBlindness as an ictal phenomenon: investigations with EEG and SPECT in two patients suffering from epilepsy. Blindness is a rare ictal phenomenon in epileptic seizures. It can occur as an aura, as the seizure itself, or postictally. We investigated two such patients, in one of whom blindness manifested as an aura prior to tonic clonic seizures; the interictal EEG exhibited a spike-wave focus bioccipitally. In the second patient blindness occurred postictally. An ictal SPECT, carried out at the onset of the seizure demonstrated marked hyperperfusion in both occipital regions. \nAcute hemiplegia associated with HIV infection. An acute hemiplegia secondary to a large cerebral infarct is described in a 16-month-old infant with congenitally-acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection. Serial imaging studies during the next year documented improvement in his hemiplegia and a static underlying human immunodeficiency virus encephalopathy. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of children with acute hemiplegia. \nMoricizine: a new agent for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Over the last several years, a number of new antiarrhythmic agents have come into use. One of these promising new drugs, moricizine hydrochloride (Ethmozine), is now available for use in this country. Although similar in some aspects to both quinidine and lidocaine, Moricizine hydrochloride is in many ways unique. The purpose of this review is to summarize the pharmacologic and physiologic effects of moricizine and to outline its clinical use. \nSuccess and failure with neonatal tracheo-oesophageal anomalies. In seven and a half years, one surgical team treated 67 consecutive neonates with oesophageal atresia and/or tracheo-oesophageal fistula. According to Waterston's classification, 28 were in group A, 12 in group B and 27 in group C. The mortality rate during the initial admission was 10 per cent, all seven deaths being unavoidable in infants in group C with multiple anomalies. Birthweight alone had no bearing upon the chances of survival. Primary oesophageal repair, including one suture-fistula procedure and one delayed primary repair, was attempted in 54 (84 per cent) of the 64 patients with atresia and was successful in 46 (85 per cent). All three H-type tracheo-oesophageal fistulae were successfully divided in infants in group A. Recurrent tracheo-oesophageal fistula developed in four (7 per cent) infants, one of whom (group A) underwent successful repair. One disrupted anastomosis was successfully resutured (group A), so an intact oesophagus was finally achieved in 51 patients, of whom six (12 per cent) developed anastomotic strictures and 21 (41 per cent) underwent surgery for gastro-oesophageal reflux. Of the 60 early survivors, 10 (17 per cent) underwent aortopexy for tracheomalacia. Whenever possible, primary repair is advocated in all infants. Even for those in group C with multiple, severe associated anomalies, the combined early and late mortality was no greater following primary repair (7 died of 12 operated) than after staged repair (4 died of 7 operated), but major anastomotic complications were more common in infants in group C (5 out of 19) than in those in groups A and B (3 out of 38). \nAssessment of quality of life by patient and spouse during antihypertensive therapy with atenolol and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system. To evaluate differences in efficacy, safety, and quality of life, 394 male patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to receive 20 weeks of either atenolol or nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) in a multicenter double-blind trial. A four-week placebo washout was followed by 8 weeks of titration and 12 weeks of maintenance therapy. Quality-of-life evaluation included clinical assessments by the patient and parallel take-home assessments by patient and spouse. Blood pressure was controlled equally in both groups. The total incidence of adverse reactions was similar in both groups, but a greater percentage of nifedipine GITS patients withdrew due to peripheral edema. Patients completing 20 weeks of therapy demonstrated a more favorable quality-of-life profile (P less than .05) for nifedipine GITS over atenolol in psychosocial (P less than .01), well-being (P less than .05), general affect (P less than .05), emotional ties (P less than .01), emotional control (P less than .05), vitality (P less than .05), and leisure (P less than .05) scores. Treatment differences were particularly pronounced for patients over 50 years of age and were not fully detectable until after 14 weeks of therapy. Deterioration in quality of life was associated with withdrawal. Spouses of younger patients receiving atenolol reported deterioration in sexual satisfaction as compared to spouses of patients taking nifedipine GITS (P less than .02). Thus age, length of trial, and third-party observation are important factors in quality-of-life assessment. Comparison of adverse reactions provides an incomplete measure of how well a drug is tolerated. In contrast, findings indicate that even subtle CNS-mediated effects on mood and well-being can be detected by quality-of-life evaluation. \nEsophagobronchial fistula and mediastinal tuberculosis. A 59-year-old man was seen with what preoperatively was thought to be an acquired esophagobronchial fistula secondary to an old burned-out infection with tuberculosis. At operation the gross and microscopic findings were most compatible with a congenital H-shaped esophagobronchial fistula. However, cultures of calcified lymph nodes grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The need for culturing calcified tissue to assure proper treatment is emphasized. \nAcute appendicitis in patients with AIDS/HIV infection. Nine patients known to have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and operated on for acute appendicitis are presented. Six of the nine patients did not have an elevation in the white blood cell count preoperatively. Two patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy prior to exploration. In four cases, a perforated appendix was removed. Seven patients had persistent postoperative fever, while all nine had a significant lack of leukocytosis after surgery. Other than the absence of a preoperative increase in white blood cell count, the presenting characteristics of this group were similar to those expected in immunocompetent patients. However, concern for a possible opportunistic infection etiology and a desire to avoid operating on these patients resulted in an undue delay prior to exploration. The use of diagnostic laparoscopy aided in earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Despite persistent postoperative fever, appendectomy was performed in patients with AIDS/HIV infection without significant increase in morbidity and mortality. \nReduction in defibrillator shocks with an implantable device combining antitachycardia pacing and shock therapy. Implantable defibrillators reduce the risk of sudden death in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, but significant restriction in quality of life can occur as a result of frequent device activation. To determine if a device that provides both antitachycardia pacing and shock therapy can safely reduce the frequency of shocks after implantation, 46 consecutive patients undergoing initial implantation of a defibrillator were studied. In all patients, the implanted device provided antitachycardia pacing and shock therapy. Detected tachycardia characteristics and the results of therapy were stored in the device's memory. There were 42 men and 4 women, aged 26 to 71 years (mean 58.7 +/- 13.5). Left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 13% to 67% (mean 32.2 +/- 13.4%) and 31 patients had experienced one or more episodes of cardiac arrest. Induced arrhythmias included sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in 38 patients, nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 2 and ventricular fibrillation in 4. Over a total follow-up period of 255 patient-months (range 1 to 13, mean 6.1), 25 patients experienced spontaneous arrhythmic events. In 22 patients, 909 episodes of tachycardia were treated by antitachycardia pacing, which was successful on 840 occasions (92.4%). Acceleration of ventricular tachycardia by pacing therapy was estimated to have occurred 39 times. Syncope occurred once during pacing-induced acceleration of ventricular tachycardia. Forty-four episodes of tachycardia in seven patients were treated directly by shocks because of short tachycardia cycle length; 88% of all detected tachycardias were treated without the need for shocks. Four patients died from cardiorespiratory failure and one patient died suddenly without any detected tachyarrhythmia. \nBleeding esophagogastric varices. Ways to treat active episodes and prevent recurrence. Bleeding from esophagogastric varices carries a high mortality rate. Active variceal bleeding can usually be temporarily controlled medically with a combination of intravenous vasopressin and nitroglycerin, with balloon tamponade, or with endoscopic sclerotherapy. Because of the high likelihood of recurrence, long-term treatment, such as repeated sclerotherapy, propranolol therapy, or shunt surgery, is necessary. The proper selection of such measures requires consideration of the site of variceal bleeding, local availability of specialized techniques, and patient factors. Only liver transplantation reverses the liver damage and offers hope of improved long-term survival. As success at identifying high-risk patients by endoscopic features improves, propranolol or other pharmacologic prophylaxis may become an acceptable treatment. \nReorientation of the left ventricular long-axis on myocardial transaxial tomograms by a linear fitting method. A method is described for reorientating the left ventricular (LV) long-axis from myocardial transaxial tomographic data. On a midventricular transverse slice and on a midventricular sagittal slice, the apical and basal limits are selected successively by the operator. The linear activity profiles between these two limits are plotted line by line. In each profile, the two points with the maximum counts in the septal and lateral walls on the transverse slice, or in the anterior and inferior walls on the sagittal slice, are detected. The intermediate point with the minimum counts is then determined. The set of points with minimum counts are fitted by a straight line using the least squares method. This line is taken as the LV long-axis. In a series of 15 cases with stress-delayed 201Tl SPECT, the reproducibility of the reorientation with this semi-automatic method was compared with manual selection of the LV long-axis. In all patients, a successful reorientation was obtained with the present method. The reproducibility was significantly better with the semi-automatic method than with the manual selection of the LV long-axis. \nNocturnal airflow obstruction, histamine, and the autonomic central nervous system in children with allergic asthma. A study was carried out to investigate whether an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system or release of histamine, or both, is responsible for the nocturnal increase in airflow obstruction in asthmatic children. The study comprised 18 children with allergic asthma, nine with (group 1) and nine without (group 2) nocturnal airflow obstruction, and an age matched control group. All drugs were withheld for three days before and during the study. On day 4 each child was admitted to hospital and a series of measurements was made every four hours for 24 hours. These included measurements of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), heart rate and sinus arrhythmia gap from an electrocardiogram (an indirect measure of parasympathetic activity) and urine sampling for determination of catecholamine and N'-methylhistamine concentrations (measures of sympathetic activity and histamine release respectively). Urinary N'-methylhistamine excretion was significantly higher over the 24 hours in children in group 1 than in children in group 2, and overnight values were also significantly higher in children in group 1 than those in group 2. Mean (SEM) values (mumol/mol creatinine) were 154.6 (11.2) in group 1 and 110 (11.2) in group 2 for 2400-0400 hours samples and 139.2 (13.1) and 101.2 (10.6) 0400-0800 hours samples. There was no evidence of decreased sympathetic or increased parasympathetic activity in association with the nocturnal airflow obstruction; noradrenaline concentrations were increased in group 1. These observations indicate that nocturnal airflow obstruction is associated with increased release of histamine overnight. \nRegional cerebral blood flow after human cardiac arrest. A hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single photon emission computed tomographic study. We studied 30 patients 24 hours after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 13 age-matched normal controls with the use of technetium Tc 99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single photon emission computed tomography. All patients were followed up for 12 months or until death. Frontal hypoperfusion (anteroposterior perfusion ratio, less than 0.90) was observed in 23 patients (77%). In eight patients who remained comatose and died, the total size of perfusion defects was larger (38% +/- 20%) than in the 21 patients who recovered consciousness (24% +/- 14%), but the anteroposterior ratio was similar in both of these patient groups (0.83 +/- 0.09) and significantly lower than in the controls (0.96 +/- 0.03). During follow-up, both the anteroposterior perfusion ratio and the relative defect size improved, but frontal hypoperfusion was still observed in seven of 13 patients. After cardiac arrest, regional cerebral blood flow is characterized by frontal hypoperfusion that tends to improve over time but that persists in most patients. \nDecrease in the size of tetanic responses produced by nitrendipine or by extracellular calcium ion removal without blocking twitches or action potentials in skeletal muscle. The effects of removing extracellular Ca++ ions or of adding the organic calcium channel antagonist, nitrendipine, were tested on twitches and tetani (100 Hz for 2 sec) in frog toe muscles. Under conditions that did not reduce or that potentiated twitches, both procedures reduced the size of the tetanic responses. This depression was seen as an inability to maintain the maximum tetanic tension for more than 0.5 sec. Intracellular microelectrode recordings showed that the muscle fibers were depolarized (mean about 23 mV) during the stimulus train and the fiber only slowly repolarized after the train. The latter effect is the \"late negative afterpotential\" and it is produced by the accumulation of K+ ions in the t-tubules during the action potential train. Neither the depolarization nor the late negative afterpotentials were decreased in amplitude by nitrendipine. These results indicate that the voltage-sensitive, slow Ca++ channels are opened by the accumulation of K+ ions in the t-tubules during the tetanus and that the Ca++ ions entering via these channels are required to maintain the full strength of the tetanic contraction. It is suggested that this is a function of these Ca++ channels concentrated in the t-tubules of skeletal muscle fibers. \nSonography of focal lesions of the spleen. The sonographic appearances of benign and malignant splenic lesions in 154 patients are illustrated. Sixty-six of the 154 patients had malignant splenic lesions; 55 of these had malignant lymphoma and 11 had splenic metastatic lesions. The lesions were hypoechoic in 64 cases (97%), including all cases of malignant lymphoma, and were hyperechoic in two. Eighty-eight patients had benign splenic lesions; findings included cysts, infarcts, abscesses, hemangiomas, and calcifications. \nRebound tenderness test. The usefulness of the rebound tenderness test in indicating peritonitis was prospectively assessed in 142 unselected patients admitted as emergencies with abdominal pain and tenderness. It was found to be of no predictive value. \nLocalized depigmentation after steroid injection of a ganglion cyst on the hand. Presented is the case of a man who had localized depigmentation after local injection of triamcinolone diacetate. Search of the literature indicates that this is a rare complication of such therapy. Localized depigmentation may have important cultural implications for dark-skinned patients. There is some experimental evidence that less-potent and shorter-acting steroid preparations have a lower likelihood for depigmenting side effects, and such agents may be more appropriate when injecting subcutaneous structures to prevent this complication. \nEnterobius egg granuloma of the vulva and peritoneum: review of the literature. Two cases of Enterobius granuloma containing eggs only are reported. The first case involved the vulva, where no such granuloma has been reported previously. The coexistence of peritoneal granuloma and rectal adenocarcinoma in the second case suggests the possibility of direct penetration of the damaged colonic wall by the parasite, as emphasized by several previous reports of neoplastic involvement and perforation of the intestinal wall in cases of ectopic infections. The diagnostic criteria of Enterobius eggs granuloma, which might be a diagnostic dilemma for pathologists who are not familiar with such criteria, are described herein. \nAcute encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency (Wernicke's encephalopathy) in a chronic hemodialyzed patient: a case report. We report the case of a patient with terminal renal disease on chronic hemodialysis who developed acute thiamine deficiency as confirmed by erythrocyte transketolase determinations. The patient presented with a confusional state and severe memory disturbances, but other classical features of Wernicke's encephalopathy were absent. Almost all central nervous system symptoms rapidly disappeared after thiamine therapy. Therefore the possibility of thiamine deficiency must be considered in patients on chronic dialysis who present with central nervous system disturbances, even if all of the classical features of Wernicke's encephalopathy are not present. \nPercutaneous transjugular portosystemic shunt. OBJECTIVE.--To determine the effectiveness of the Palmaz balloon expandable stent for the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The device is designed to achieve portal decompression in patients with variceal hemorrhage secondary to portal hypertension. DESIGN.--Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting was performed in eight patients during a 9-month period. Mean follow-up was 5 months. PATIENTS.--All patients had cirrhosis with portal hypertension and varices. Bleeding occurred in seven patients from esophageal varices and in one patient from hemorrhoids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Shunt patency and recurrent variceal hemorrhage. RESULTS.--Shunts created from a transjugular approach between a hepatic and a portal vein (diameters of 8 to 12 mm) lowered the average portosystemic pressure gradient from 36 to 11 mm Hg. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.7 days. Complete variceal decompression after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement was identified endoscopically in all eight patients. The patient treated for hemorrhoids rebled and was treated successfully by transfemoral balloon expansion of the shunt diameter from 8 to 12 mm. All shunts were patent at 1 to 9 months (mean, 5 months) of follow-up. CONCLUSION.--Initial results suggest that transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is a safe and effective method of portal decompression for the treatment of variceal hemorrhage. \nHistiocytic neoplasias: immunohistochemical evaluation of their frequencies among malignant lymphoma and related conditions in Japan. Through histologic review of 1,766 cases with malignant lymphoma and related conditions, 35 cases (2%) were selected as probable histiocytic neoplasias. Proliferating cells in these cases had voluminous, granulated cytoplasm, and round to irregularly shaped nuclei often with bi- or multinucleated forms showing monomorphous or polymorphous proliferation accompanying small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and, less frequently, eosinophils. Cases showing proliferation of convoluted cells with numerous benign-appearing histiocytes or large cells with clear cytoplasm were excluded under a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. To evaluate the immunologic character of proliferating cells, immunohistochemistry using antibodies Mx-Pan B, MB-1, MT-1, UCHL-1, lysozyme, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, S-100 alpha, S-100 beta, Leu M1, epithelial membrane antigen, and Ki-1 were carried out in 23 cases. Naphthol-ASD-chloracetate reaction and toluidine blue stain were also performed. These procedures revealed that 12 cases (52%) were B-cell type, three cases (13%) T-cell type, six cases (26%) true histiocytic type, and two cases null type. Therefore, the frequency of cases with true histiocytic neoplasias among cases with malignant lymphoma and related conditions in Japan may be 0.5%. \nChildhood predictors of future blood pressure. Blood pressure in infants and children is much lower than that in adults. It is suspected that children whose blood pressures are greatest for their age or body size may be destined for future hypertension. However, it is apparent that some children with lower blood pressures are also destined for hypertension as adults. Children with a family history of hypertension demonstrate greater blood pressure and heart rate responses to mental challenge. These responses are enhanced when a high salt diet is consumed. Increased maximal exercise systolic blood pressure and increased left ventricular wall mass in childhood add significantly to the prediction of future high blood pressure. In addition, the acquisition of excess weight for height from childhood to young adult life adds to the prediction of future blood pressure elevations. Both children and adults who are obese have significantly higher blood pressures than those who are lean. Approximately 34% of the variability in body mass index is explained by genotype differences at a single recessive locus, 41% by genotype differences at polygenic loci, and 25% by nongenetic factors. Thus, the genetic influence of obesity may be an important factor responsible for elevated blood pressure in both children and adults. \nAnemia and postoperative apnea in former preterm infants. To examine the association between anemia and postoperative apnea in former preterm infants, 24 former preterm infants of less than 60 weeks postconceptual age undergoing inguinal hernia repair were studied. A hematocrit of at least 25% was required for study participation. General endotracheal inhalational anesthesia, supplemented with neuromuscular blockade and controlled ventilation, was used. No barbiturates or opioids were administered. Respiratory pattern and heart rate were recorded for at least 12 h postoperatively using an impedance pneumograph. Tracings were analyzed for evidence of apnea, periodic breathing, and/or bradycardia by a pulmonologist unaware of the hematologic profile of the infant. Nineteen patients had a hematocrit of 30% or greater (group 1). Their mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) gestational age was 33.5 +/- 2.7 weeks and postconceptual age 45.5 +/- 4.6 weeks. Five infants had a hematocrit less than 30% (group 2). Their mean gestational age (+/- SD) was 32.4 +/- 3.2 weeks and postconceptual age 43.6 +/- 5.5 weeks. Anemic infants had an 80% incidence of postoperative apnea versus 21% in infants with a normal hematocrit (P less than .03). In the infants who developed postoperative prolonged apnea and/or bradycardia, a prior history of apnea was equally present in both groups (21% in group 1 and 20% in group 2). This study shows that anemia in former preterm infants can be associated with an increased incidence of postoperative apnea. \nHaemangioma of the urinary tract: review of the literature. General features. Haemangiomas are benign vascular tumours. They can regress spontaneously as a result of fibrosclerosis, suggesting a conservative approach wherever possible. Asymptomatic haemangiomas do not require treatment. Renal haemangioma. In all, 198 cases have been reported. The lesion is usually solitary and unilateral and occurs most often in the pyramid, and in the mucosa or subepithelial tissue of the pelvis. In some cases a tentative diagnosis of haemangioma has been made by means of selective renal angiography and pre- or per-operative renoscopy. Partial nephrectomy is recommended in cases of minor haemangioma. Ureteric haemangioma. Six cases have been described. When haemangioma is suspected a conservative operation is recommended. Bladder haemangioma. A total of 106 cases have been reported. Many of the tumours had the characteristics of an iceberg, with considerable extravesical extension making endoscopic management less suitable because of the possibility of massive haemorrhage or recurrence. Consequently, many authors prefer local excision. In the case of endoscopic treatment the patient should be prepared for open surgery. Urethral haemangioma. Twenty cases have been described. The lesions often extend further than is immediately apparent. Endoscopic management is recommended for small lesions and, in the case of more extensive lesions, open exploration is advised followed by appropriate urethral reconstruction. \nGastrointestinal complications in 4473 patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Thirty-nine gastrointestinal complications occurred in 35 of 4473 patients (0.78 per cent) who underwent surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass during an 8-year period. The mortality rate when one of these complications occurred was 22 (63 per cent) representing 11.5 per cent of the 191 deaths from all causes in the series. The relative risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication was 1:249 when the heart was not opened, 1:66 when it was and 1:5 after cardiac transplantation. Gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 20) was the most common complication of whom nine (45 per cent) died, followed by intestinal infarction (n = 12) with eight (67 per cent) deaths and acute pancreatitis (n = 6) all of whom died. There was one death after surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 7). No patient survived bowel infarction without operation but resection was possible in five of the eight who underwent surgery, four of whom survived. The results demonstrate that surgical intervention is not associated with undue mortality but inappropriate conservative therapy is poorly tolerated in this high-risk group. \nFamilial enteric neuropathy with pseudoobstruction. We report a case of autosomal dominant chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction secondary to a familial enteric neuropathy. Esophagogastrointestinal manometry studies in the index case showed decreased postprandial contractile frequency with normal amplitude of pressure activity in the stomach and small bowel. Pupillary function and autonomic reflexes were all normal, excluding an extrinsic autonomic neuropathy of the viscera. Histologic examination of the small intestine by hematoxylin and eosin stains revealed normal smooth muscles but a reduced number of neurons in the myenteric plexus without inflammatory cells or neuroNal intranuclear inclusions. Histologic examination of the myenteric plexus using the sections taken along the longitudinal axis of the intestine, stained with silver by the Smith technique, disclosed decreased numbers of argyrophilic neurons and degeneration of neurons and axons; however, there was no reactive increase in the number of glial cell nuclei. The patient's mother had suffered from chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, which did not abate following extensive small bowel resection. This is the third family reported with an autosomal dominant enteric neuropathy unassociated with evidence of extrinsic autonomic or peripheral neuropathy. Subtotal resection of the small bowel was followed by recurrence of the pseudoobstruction syndrome in both affected members of the family. \nDoes the retrocecal position of the vermiform appendix alter the clinical course of acute appendicitis? A prospective analysis. Ninety-four adult patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis were prospectively studied during a 2-year period. Patients were divided into retrocecal (group 1; n = 27 [29%]) and anterior (group 2; n = 67 [71%]) groups according to the position of the appendix. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in duration of symptoms, presenting signs and symptoms, and initial white blood cell count. Furthermore, retrocecal appendicitis was not associated with a higher rate of perforation or increased morbidity. We conclude that the retrocecal position of the appendix does not alter the presentation of appendicitis. \nTransmetatarsal amputation: the role of adjunctive revascularization. Over a 12-year period, 160 transmetatarsal amputations were performed in patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease. The following groups were defined: group 1 - nonreconstructable disease (n = 40); group 2 - transmetatarsal amputation in conjunction with distal revascularization (n = 99); group 3 - reconstructable disease but transmetatarsal amputation performed without simultaneous revascularization (n = 21). There were nine early deaths in the entire series, for an operative mortality rate of 5.6%. The lowest rate of transmetatarsal amputation healing (24%) occurred in group 1. An 86% healing rate was achieved in group 3, but in seven cases (33%) some type of revascularization was required within 3 months of the amputation. In group 2 the healing rate was 62% but reached 83% where the bypass remained patent for at least 3 months after the amputation. Long-term patency rates also affected healing. Healing was not influenced by the number of local procedures (single vs multiple). The presence of severe infection or extensive necrosis necessitated open transmetatarsal amputation in 89 cases; the remaining 71 amputations involved primary closure. Since many patients were treated at a time when diagnostic modalities as well as the operative indications and techniques differed somewhat from the current practice, much of the information regarding group I patients in particular should be considered as a negative historical control and any conclusion from our data should be adjusted accordingly. Healing after amputation at the transmetatarsal level can be expected in the majority of instances in which revascularization can be performed with predictable patency, even when the standard criteria for performing such amputations are liberalized. \nIdiopathic gastroparesis in patients with unexplained nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting are symptoms sometimes associated with motor dysfunction. We compared a group of young patients suffering from chronic nausea and/or vomiting and normal upper gastrointestinal x-ray series with a control group. The members of both groups underwent isotopic examinations of their stomachs. The aim of the study was to find a simple method of checking the stomach and proving a motor dysfunction in a group of patients with chronic, inexplicable nausea and vomiting. Patients and controls fasted for at least 6 hr were given 0.5 mCI of [99mTc] diethylene triaminopentaacetic acid orally in 150 cc milk with 50 g cornflakes. A time-activity curve was obtained and radioactivity over the stomach was recorded exponentially. The parameter of the T1/2 emptying time was used. In normal controls T1/2 emptying time ranged from 18 to 26 min. Twenty-five symptomatic patients were examined, three of whom achieved normal values, but 22 patients showed pathologic results ranging from 36 to 184 min. In patients with chronic nausea and/or vomiting an isotopic examination of the stomach may provide a simple and rapid diagnostic method of evaluation. \nCorrection of a human beta S-globin gene by gene targeting. As a step toward using gene targeting for gene therapy, we have corrected a human beta S-globin gene to the normal beta A allele by homologous recombination in the mouse-human hybrid cell line BSM. BSM is derived from a mouse erythroleukemia cell line and carries a single human chromosome 11 with the beta S-globin allele. A beta A-globin targeting construct containing a unique oligomer and a neomycin-resistance gene was electroporated into the BSM cells, which were then placed under G418 selection. Then 126 resulting pools containing a total of approximately 29,000 G418-resistant clones were screened by PCR for the presence of a targeted recombinant: 3 positive pools were identified. A targeted clone was isolated by replating one of the positive pools into smaller pools and rescreening by PCR, followed by dilution cloning. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the isolated clone had been targeted as planned. The correction of the beta S allele to beta A was confirmed both by allele-specific PCR and by allele-specific antibodies. Expression studies comparing the uninduced and induced RNA levels in unmodified BSM cells and in the targeted clone showed no significant alteration in the ability of the targeted clone to undergo induction, despite the potentially disrupting presence of a transcriptionally active neomycin gene 5' to the human beta A-globin gene. Thus gene targeting can correct a beta S allele to beta A, and the use of a selectable helper gene need not significantly interfere with the induction of the corrected gene. \nN-myc genomic content and DNA ploidy in stage IVS neuroblastoma. DNA ploidy and N-myc genomic content were analyzed in a series of stage IVS neuroblastomas by flow cytometry and Southern blot hybridization, respectively. Of the 12 stage IVS neuroblastomas studied, nine were aneuploid (DNA index [DI] greater than 1), two were diploid (DI = 1), and one was not assessable for DNA content due to insufficient tumor material. N-myc gene amplification was present in two of 12 tumors. None of the aneuploid tumors exhibited N-myc amplification. Among the aneuploid neuroblastomas, the DIs were between 1.27 and 1.60, ie, in the near-triploid range. The follow-up from diagnosis ranged from 1 to 41 months (mean, 20 months). The nine neuroblastomas with near-triploid DNA content were free of disease at the end of the follow-up period. In contrast, a rapid and fatal tumor progression was observed for the three neuroblastomas with N-myc amplification and/or diploidy. Although involving only a limited series, these results strongly suggest that the combined analysis of DNA ploidy and N-myc genomic content could predict clinical outcome in stage IVS neuroblastoma and should help to identify patients for whom a more aggressive therapy is required. \nLong-term results after lateral cranial base surgery. The surgical management of patients with slow-growing benign temporal bone neoplasms has been criticized because of its significant morbidity and mortality compared with results after radiation therapy, but long-term control by irradiation remains unproved. Long-term surgical results have not been studied previously. One hundred twenty-nine skull base operations were performed in 126 patients at the Otology Group, Nashville, Tenn., from January 1970 through May 1987. Fifty-eight patients responded to questionnaires focusing on recovery from loss of cranial nerves. All patients regained some degree of facial function (class V or better), no alimentary tubes or tracheotomies were in use, and no patients had debilitating aspiration. Long-term compensation from the cranial nerve deficits of lateral skull base surgery can be expected in most patients and should not be used as an argument for irradiation in patients with a long life expectancy at time of diagnosis. \nIntracerebral temperature in neurosurgical patients. Recent laboratory results have indicated that the ischemic brain is very sensitive to minor variations in temperature. This has created new interest in hypothermia and brain temperature. There is, however, very little information available regarding human intracerebral temperature and its relation to body core temperature during normal and pathological circumstances. We therefore made continuous measurements of the temperature of the lateral ventricle in 15 neurosurgical patients utilizing a newly developed technique with copper-constantan thermocouples introduced through a plastic catheter also used for monitoring intracranial pressure. The intraventricular temperature was higher than the rectal temperature during approximately 90% of all measurements. The largest temperature gradient measured was 2.3 degrees C. Usually the difference between the temperature of the rectum and the brain was much smaller, the mean value being 0.33 degrees C. For the patients in the most severe condition, the rectal temperature was sufficiently close to the brain temperature to afford a reliable basis for adequate clinical judgment. \nThe potential roles of leukotrienes in bronchial asthma. Leukotrienes (LTs), in particular LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, have been shown to be capable of participating in the induction of three related processes observed during the immediate reaction in bronchial asthma: edema formation, mucus secretion, and muscle contraction. Despite impressive evidence potentially implicating the LTs, the role of LTs in asthma is still unproved, and a positive answer to their critical actions in causing airflow obstruction will require studies with specific antagonists. \nFunctional recovery of hibernating myocardium after coronary bypass surgery: does it coincide with improvement in perfusion? To determine the relationship between functional recovery and improvement in perfusion after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), 49 patients were studied. Radionuclide angiography was performed before, 1 month after, and 6 to 12 months after CABG to evaluate regional wall motion. Exercise thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging was done before and 1 month after CABG to assess regional perfusion. Preoperative asynergy was observed in 108 segments, and 74 of them showed an improvement in wall motion 1 month after CABG (segment A). Sixty-six of these segments (89%) were associated with an improvement in perfusion. Eight segments that had not improved 1 month after CABG demonstrated a delayed recovery of wall motion 6 to 12 months after CABG (segment B). However, seven of eight segments (88%) already showed an improvement in perfusion 1 month after CABG. A total of 82 segments exhibited functional recovery after CABG and were considered hibernating segments. In the preoperative study segment B more frequently had areas of akinesis or dyskinesis than segment A (75% vs 34%, p less than 0.05). The mean percent thallium-201 uptake in segment B was lower than that in segment A (74% +/- 9% vs 83% +/- 8%, p less than 0.05). Functional recovery of hibernating myocardium usually coincided with an improvement in perfusion. However, delayed functional recovery after reperfusion was observed in some instances. Severe asynergy and severe thallium-201 defects were more frequently observed in these segments with delayed recovery. Hibernating myocardium might remain stunned during those recovery periods. \nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection and diffuse polyneuropathy. Implications for rehabilitation medicine. Patients at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection require rehabilitation services. These patients present problems for each of the disciplines in a rehabilitation team, and all team members must confront the psychosocial and ethical issues involved with the disease. Patients with HIV infection may have polyneuropathy with multisystem involvement, including dysphagia, autonomic dysfunction, respiratory failure, bowel and bladder dysfunction, generalized weakness, a painful sensory neuropathy, and depression. Guidelines are presented for determining if inpatient rehabilitation or other settings are appropriate. Case management is a valuable strategy for the rehabilitation of patients with this complicated disorder. \nIntestinal absorption of cholecalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in patients with both Crohn's disease and intestinal resection. We compared the intestinal absorption of cholecalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in patients with Crohn's disease and resections of the small bowel. Patients were subgrouped into those with small (less than 100 cm), intermediate (100-300 cm), and large (greater than 300 cm) resections. [3H]cholecalciferol or [3H]25-hydroxycholecalciferol were given orally and serial blood samples were taken for measurement of plasma radiolabeled vitamin. Absorption of both forms of the vitamin decreased with extent of resection but 25-hydroxycholecalciferol absorption was always greater than that of cholecalciferol. When compared with normal control subjects, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol absorption in these patients was better maintained than that of cholecalciferol. These data indicate that vitamin D malabsorption reflects the extent of distal small-bowel resection in Crohn's disease. Treatment with oral cholecalciferol is sufficient in those with small or moderate resections but oral 25-hydroxycholecalciferol supplementation may be preferred in those with a severe short-bowel syndrome. \nZinc sulphate therapy for Wilson's disease after acute deterioration during treatment with low-dose D-penicillamine. A 30-year-old woman with Wilson's disease was treated with low-dose D-penicillamine. After 12 days, treatment was changed to zinc sulphate because of severe neurological deterioration. The patient subsequently improved within a few days. During a follow-up period of 20 months, the effectiveness of therapy was evaluated by measuring copper and zinc levels in plasma and urine, and by 64Cu-loading tests. We conclude that sulphate therapy may be a satisfactory alternative, even when rapid deterioration occurs in the early stages of D-penicillamine treatment. \nCardiovascular risk factors in primary hyperparathyroidism: a 15-year follow-up of operated and unoperated cases. The need for treatment of mild and apparently asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is questioned, but a raised incidence of cardiovascular disease has been regarded as evidence in favour of surgery. While it is well known that several risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose tolerance) are overrepresented in HPT, it is not known whether surgery provides long-term normalization in these respects and reduces the risk of premature death. In a 15-year follow-up of a cohort of 172 subjects in whom mild hypercalcaemia was initially detected during a health screening, it was found that 56 subjects had died. 17 individuals had been operated on for HPT, 47 individuals were persistently hypercalcaemic, while 45 subjects had serum calcium within the normal range (seven individuals were lost to follow-up). There had been no significant differences in blood pressure between these groups of mildly hypercalcaemic patients and age- and sex-matched controls at the initial screening, but at follow-up blood pressure was significantly higher not only in subjects with persistent hypercalcaemia, but also in those who had been successfully operated on for HPT. Neither of the hypercalcaemic groups showed any significant deviations from the controls with regard to indices of lipid or glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that there is no simple cause-and-effect relationship to account for the propensity toward high blood pressure in primary HPT. Consequently it cannot be assumed that surgery for HPT will eliminate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with mild HPT. \nMaturation of respiratory reflex responses in the piglet. Stimulation of chemo-, irritant, and pulmonary C-fiber receptors reflexly constricts airway smooth muscle and alters ventilation in mature animals. These reflex responses of airway smooth muscle have, however, not been clearly characterized during early development. In this study we compared the maturation of reflex pathways regulating airway smooth muscle tone and ventilation in anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated 2- to 3- and 10-wk-old piglets. Tracheal smooth muscle tension was measured from an open tracheal segment by use of a force transducer, and phrenic nerve activity was measured from a proximal cut end of the phrenic nerve. Inhalation of 7% CO2 caused a transient increase in tracheal tension in both age groups, whereas hypoxia caused no airway smooth muscle response in either group. The phrenic responses to 7% CO2 and 12% O2 were comparable in both age groups. Lung deflation and capsaicin (20 micrograms/kg iv) administration did not alter tracheal tension in the younger piglets but caused tracheal tension to increase by 87 +/- 28 and 31 +/- 10%, respectively, in the older animals (both P less than 0.05). In contrast, phrenic response to both stimuli was comparable between ages: deflation increased phrenic activity while capsaicin induced neural apnea. Laryngeal stimulation did not increase tracheal tension but induced neural apnea in both age groups. These data demonstrate that between 2 and 10 wk of life, piglets exhibit developmental changes in the reflex responses of airway smooth muscle situated in the larger airways in response to irritant and C-fiber but not chemoreceptor stimulation. \nAbrupt vessel closure following platelet transfusion post-PTCA. A successful PTCA was complicated by abrupt closure following a platelet transfusion which was given for control of local bleeding. Possible mechanisms of abrupt closure are discussed. Recommendation is made to avoid giving platelet transfusion following PTCA. \nPorencephalic cyst: a complication of fetal intravascular transfusion. A case of unilateral porencephalic cyst as a result of intravascular intrauterine transfusion is reported. Although other factors may have contributed, fetal bradycardia and relative hyperviscosity as a result of increased fetal hematocrit value were considered to be related to this event. Because some authors recommend direct intravascular transfusion to supraphysiologic hematocrits to prolong the interval between procedures, we would caution the use of this approach on the basis of theoretic considerations and the occurrence of this complication. \nInfrapopliteal bypass for severe ischemia: comparison of autogenous vein, composite, and prosthetic grafts. Results of 253 consecutive bypass grafts to infrapopliteal arteries were reviewed. Most (92%) were placed for rest pain (103) or tissue loss (130). Autogenous veins were used in 175 (69%) cases, composite vein-prosthetic grafts were used in 45 (18%), and prosthetic grafts alone were used in 33 (13%). Follow-up ranged from 0 to 101 months (mean, 19 months); 37 grafts (15%) were lost to follow-up. The operative mortality rate was 4%, and 5-year patient survival rate was 44%. Limb salvage was 82% at 5 years. The 5-year patency of vein grafts (63%) exceeded that of both composite (28%) and prosthetic (7%) grafts (p = 0.005 and p = 0.00007, respectively); but the patency of composite and prosthetic grafts did not differ significantly (p = 0.29). The patency of reversed vein (59%) and in situ vein grafts (74%) was not significantly different at 5 years (p = 0.34). Patency was also not affected by the site of the proximal or distal anastomoses or diabetes. The major determinant of long-term patency in infrapopliteal reconstructions continues to be graft material. Composite grafts offered no clear advantage over prosthetic grafts, and both should be used only when there is no other alternative to amputation. \nExperience with rehabilitation in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) represent a novel referral population for rehabilitation services. Limited information about the rehabilitation needs of individuals with human immunodeficiency virus infection is available. We reviewed 51 consecutive patients with AIDS referred to a rehabilitation consult service. Common problems encountered included generalized deconditioning (27%) and neurologic dysfunction (45%). Neurologic presentations were diverse and included hemiparesis, diffuse cognitive dysfunction and dementia, myelopathy, myopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Other patients were referred for wound care as well as the management of the local effects of Kaposi's sarcoma, various musculoskeletal syndromes and new onset blindness. Problems identified included impaired mobility (76%), difficulty with self-care (57%), impaired cognition (29%) and uncontrolled pain (37%). Among the rehabilitation interventions utilized were therapeutic exercise (73%), gait aids (45%), bathroom and safety equipment (45%), orthotics (29%), vocational counseling (4%), pain management (29%) and whirlpool treatments (10%). Five patients were too ill or refused treatment. We conclude that AIDS patients referred for rehabilitation have a wide variety of physical deficits, demonstrate a considerable degree of functional impairment and may require multiple rehabilitation interventions. \nAdnexal torsion. An unusual cause of abdominal pain in postmenopausal women. Adnexal torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain in older women. Because the presenting symptoms and signs are vague, the diagnosis is not often considered. Lower abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting are usual in patients with torsion. Ultrasonography or computed tomography are useful diagnostic tests. Two case reports of older patients with adnexal torsion are presented to emphasize the diagnostic features of this entity, including lower abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal mass. Although the condition is uncommon, adnexal torsion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain. \nGenetic analysis of autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus in mice Two genes, Idd-3 and Idd-4, that influence the onset of autoimmune type 1 diabetes in the nonobese diabetic mouse have been located on chromosomes 3 and 11, outside the chromosome 17 major histocompatibility complex. A genetic map of the mouse genome, analysed using the polymerase chain reaction, has been assembled specifically for the study. On the basis of comparative maps of the mouse and human genomes, the homologue of Idd-3 may reside on human chromosomes 1 or 4 and Idd-4 on chromosome 17. \nEffect of Helicobacter pylori infection on the severity of gastroduodenal mucosal injury after the acute administration of naproxen or aspirin to normal volunteers. This study asked whether Helicobactor pylori infection accentuated the severity of NSAID-induced mucosal injury of the stomach or duodenum. We evaluated the severity of acute mucosal injury and H. pylori status in 61 normal volunteers (ages 22-43 yr) receiving naproxen (1000 mg, n = 30) or aspirin (3900 mg, n = 31) daily for 7 days. NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal mucosa each were endoscopically graded separately for hemorrhages and erosions-ulcers on a scale of 0 to 4. H. pylori infection was identified by a sensitive and specific ELISA. Nine of the 30 subjects in the naproxen group and 12 of the 31 subjects in the aspirin group were H. pylori positive (p = NS). There was no statistically significant difference between the frequency of mucosal hemorrhage in those with and those without H. pylori infection (44% compared with 33% for those receiving naproxen and 90% of those receiving ASA, p = NS for each). There were also no differences in the frequency or severity of erosive mucosal injury seen, e.g., acute ulcers were found in 16.5% and 17.5% of infected and uninfected subjects, respectively. We conclude that the presence of H. pylori infection does not influence the degree or type of mucosal damage associated with the acute administration of naproxen or aspirin. \nDown syndrome due to de novo Robertsonian translocation t(14q;21q): DNA polymorphism analysis suggests that the origin of the extra 21q is maternal. Down syndrome is rarely due to a de novo Robertsonian translocation t(14q;21q). DNA polymorphisms in eight families with Down syndrome due to de novo t(14q;21q) demonstrated maternal origin of the extra chromosome 21q in all cases. In seven nonmosaic cases the DNA markers showed crossing-over between two maternal chromosomes 21, and in one mosaic case no crossing-over was observed (this case was probably due to an early postzygotic nondisjunction). In the majority of cases (five of six informative families) the proximal marker D21S120 was reduced to homozygosity in the offspring with trisomy 21. The data can be best explained by chromatid translocation in meiosis I and by normal crossover and segregation in meiosis I and meiosis II. \nOxygen transport in cardiogenic and septic shock. OBJECTIVE: To review clinical studies of oxygen transport in cardiogenic and septic shock. DESIGN: Descriptive and prospective studies. SETTING: University hospital multi disciplinary ICU. PATIENTS: Critically ill cardiogenic and septic shock patients greater than 18 and less than 80 yrs of age. INTERVENTIONS: The responses to volume loading with colloid or crystalloid and infusion of catecholamines are documented with baseline hemodynamic and oxygen transport measurements before and after administration of catecholamines. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen patients in cardiogenic shock were studied. In three patients, invasive systemic mean arterial pressure was greater than 80 mm Hg and cardiac index was greater than 2.0 L/min.m2. In all patients, there were increases in oxygen extraction ratio that averaged 48 +/- 18 (SD) %. However, in 30 septic shock patients, extraction ratio was 24 +/- 2%. In both groups, the response to therapy was an increase in mixed venous oxygen saturation from 54 +/- 16% to 69 +/- 8% in cardiogenic patients (p less than .001) and from 75 +/- 2% to 80 +/- 1% in septic shock (p less than .01). CONCLUSIONS: There are widely differing oxygen transport patterns in cardiogenic and septic shock that may have implications for therapy. \nRepair of a cerebrospinal fluid perilymph fistula primarily through the middle ear and secondarily by occluding the cochlear aqueduct. A 35-year-old man had a 5-year history of fluctuating hearing loss in his only hearing ear. History and diagnostic tests indicated a perilymph fistula, a diagnosis subsequently confirmed by exploration. Primary and secondary repairs temporarily ameliorated symptoms. A spinal fluid to middle ear fluid pathway was identified by radioactive tracer. A patent cochlear aqueduct indicated on computed tomography scan was found and repaired through a posterior cranial fossa approach. Hearing was preserved, remaining relatively stable during the 2-year follow-up period. \nNew trends in gallstone management. Many new therapies for the management of gallstone disease have been pioneered in the past decade. The object of this review is to equip the surgeon with the answers to all of the questions a patient will ask about gallstone therapy; the review is therefore didactic as well as comprehensive. \nCardiac performance indices during hypervolemic therapy for cerebral vasospasm. The effect of hypervolemic preload enhancement on cardiac performance was systematically analyzed in nine patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patients ranged in age from 34 to 63 years, and none had a history of cardiac disease. Each patient underwent placement of a flow-directed balloon-tipped catheter and the following measurements were taken during hypervolemic therapy: pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), and left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI). After baseline measurements were recorded, hetastarch or plasmanate was infused intravenously at 300 cc/hr. Thermal output determination and pressures were measured every 15 minutes. The PAWP did not correlate in a statistically significant fashion with the CVP in the ranges recorded; however, a statistically significant correlation did exist between PAWP increases and increases in CI, SVI, and LVSWI (p less than 0.01). There was no statistical correlation between PAWP increases above 14 mm Hg and improvement in cardiac performance as evidenced by CI, SVI, and LVSWI measurements. It is concluded that CVP is an unreliable index of cardiac performance during hypervolemic therapy and that, in previously healthy individuals, a PAWP of 14 mm Hg is associated with maximum cardiac performance. \nHistologic and ultrastructural findings of tissue ingrowth. The Leeds-Keio prosthetic anterior cruciate ligament. A light and electron microscopy investigation was performed on a Leeds-Keio ligament removed because of rupture 18 months after implantation to repair an anterior cruciate ligament. The investigation showed fibrous connective tissue on the plane of the main stress force. There was elastin and adequate vascularization interspersed with Type I collagen fibrils in the area most distant from the ligament. The tissue near the Dacron fibers was highly cellular with a matrix of infrequent, thin collagen fibrils and abundant fine granular material. The growth of the host tissue occurred in and around a Leeds-Keio ligament in response to tensile stresses. \nSurgical method for treatment of syndactyly with osseous fusion of the distal phalanges. For the interdigital space plasty to correct a syndactyly with fusion of the distal phalanges, we adopted a new operative procedure, covering the exposed distal bone with local rectangular flaps designed transversely on both dorsal and volar surfaces. A full-thickness skin graft from the groin region covers the remaining raw surface. The procedure was performed in six patients, and the flaps measured 6 mm (width) x 12 to 16 mm (length) in four patients, 5 x 15 mm in one patient, and 5 x 18 mm in one patient. Partial necrosis was observed in only one patient, in whom a narrow flap of 5 x 18 mm was used. In the other five patients, however, the results were satisfactory on both external appearance and function during the follow-up period of 3 to 6 years. \nFlexible cystoscopy compared with ultrasound in the detection of recurrent bladder tumours. A combination of transrectal and transabdominal ultrasound was compared with flexible cystoscopy as a means of detecting recurrent bladder tumours. The study group comprised 50 patients who had previously had rigid cystoscopy. They underwent combination ultrasound in the out-patient department 1 week before flexible cystoscopy. Combination ultrasound identified 25 patients with recurrent tumours and flexible cystoscopy identified 26. Thirty-four patients (68%) preferred ultrasound, 10 (20%) preferred flexible cystoscopy, 3 (6%) preferred general anaesthesia and rigid cystoscopy and 3 (6%) had no preference. The main objection to ultrasound was the use of the transrectal probe. \nAmbulatory stab evulsion phlebectomy for truncal varicose veins. The management of primary varicose veins is evolving. Recovery time, cost, recurrence rate, and cosmesis are critical determinants. Classic \"high ligation\" and ankle-to-groin stripping is expensive, results in a long convalescence, and may produce unacceptable scarring and possible permanent nerve injury. This report describes the technique of stab evulsion phlebectomy performed in an outpatient setting. Under loco-regional anesthesia, and after high ligation, existing tributary and trunk varicosities are evulsed with specially designed hooks. The multiple stab incisions, 1.5- to 3-mm long, are closed with adhesive strips. Fifty-six patients, with 69 involved limbs, have been operated on during the past 9 months. Postoperative pain and complications were minimal. Convalescence was eliminated and all patients immediately resumed normal daily activities. Cosmesis was excellent. This technique is based on hemodynamically accurate principles. It effectively removes all varicosities, eliminates the proximal source of reflux, and disconnects potentially outflowing perforators, yet leaves in situ undamaged trunk veins, which may be used as potential vein grafts. \nPrimary central nervous system",
