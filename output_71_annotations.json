Published radiobiological data support the concept that all the major morbidities attributed to conventional neuraxis radiotherapy will be reduced by the currently described technique without reducing tumour control rates. \nMechanical obstruction to ventilation from an ovarian cyst during pregnancy. This report documents the danger of the gravid uterus fixing a large ovarian cyst in a position disadvantageous to diaphragmatic excursion and thereby obstructing ventilation. A 34-year-old pregnant patient presented at 18 weeks amenorrhoea with a large ovarian cyst. She gave a history of exertional dyspnoea and orthopnoea. Clinical examination revealed a grossly enlarged abdomen and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths.min-1. Intraoperatively, ventilation was markedly impaired resulting in cyanosis and bradycardia. This was relieved by drainage of the ovarian cyst. A left lateral tilt with manual traction on the tumour may have avoided this problem. Should the above measures be inadequate, immediate drainage of the cyst is essential. Severe respiratory distress may require ultrasound-guided, percutaneous, aspiration of the cyst preoperatively. However, as in this patient, the absence of gross signs of respiratory failure does not preclude acute ventilatory failure after induction of anaesthesia. \nDifferent lectin-binding patterns in primary breast cancers and their metastases. The expression of glycoconjugates in primary tumors and their metastases in 18 consecutive cases of metastasized breast cancer was studied by use of lectin histochemistry. Paraffin sections were stained with a panel of seven fluorochrome-labeled lectins with defined sugar specificities. The study revealed variation in the lectin binding patterns of individual cancers. In the primary tumors the lectin reactivity was diversified, whereas in their respective metastases it was rather homogeneous. This finding indicates that there is intratumoral heterogeneity in the primary cancers, whereas the selected subclones of malignant cells with restricted glycoconjugate expression seem to give rise to metastases. \nA report of familial carotid body tumors and multiple extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. A case of familial carotid body tumors and multiple extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas is reported. The carotid body tumors, resected previously, were bilateral and associated with 4 intra-abdominal extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. Magnetic resonance imaging was far superior to computerized tomography and 131iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine in visualizing the intra-abdominal lesions, and may soon become the imaging technique of choice in the evaluation of patients with suspected pheochromocytoma. \nPrevention of alloimmunization in patients with acute leukemia by use of white cell-reduced blood components--a randomized trial. Platelet refractoriness arising from HLA alloimmunization is a serious complication of transfusion therapy. In a prospective randomized trial, white cell (WBC)-reduced blood components were compared to standard platelet and red cell concentrates with respect to alloimmunization, refractoriness, and platelet increments after transfusion. Sixteen of 31 adult acute leukemia patients received only WBC-reduced platelet concentrates (PCs) and red cells (RBCs), with fewer than 10(6) WBCs per unit. Fifteen control patients received standard blood components with a mean of 0.1 x 10(9) (PCs) and 1 x 10(9) (RBCs) WBCs per unit. Platelet loss during cotton-wool filtration averaged 14 percent (range, 3-32%) from fresh PCs and 24 percent (range, 9-62%) from stored PCs. Filtration did not change corrected increments (CI) measured after transfusion of fresh PCs. The Cl 1 hour after filtration of stored PCs diminished by 27 percent, but the difference was smaller after 18 hours, which suggests better survival of WBC-reduced platelets. The number of platelet units transfused did not differ in the two groups. No patient in the WBC-reduced group developed permanent platelet refractoriness; transient HLA antibodies of low titer developed in two patients. In the control group, one patient became refractory because of immunization and two developed transient HLA antibodies. It can be concluded that the reduction of WBCs in blood components can effectively prevent alloimmunization. \nBasophil-bound and serum immunoglobulin E directed against Helicobacter pylori in patients with chronic gastritis. The immunoglobulin (Ig) E immune response in patients with Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis has been evaluated. Of 26 patients with H. pylori infection, 22 (84%) tested positive for basophil-bound specific IgE (determined by the histamine release test) and 18 (69%) for serum specific IgE (determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). In contrast, only 1 of 17 persons in whom the bacterium was not detected presented cell-bound and serum specific IgE. In the 4 histamine release test--positive but enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay--negative patients, removal of antibody from the basophil surface by acid elution showed that histamine release occurred through an IgE-dependent mechanism. When normal basophils, passively sensitized with serum from IgE-positive patients, were exposed to the H. pylori antigen, a significant release was observed, confirming the class specificity of the response. Inhibition experiments with bacteria other than H. pylori showed that the IgE antibody was specifically directed against this organism. The percentage of antigen-induced histamine release did not correlate with serum specific IgE level. However, the response of basophils to antigenic challenge was proportional to IgE-dependent cellular releasability. This finding suggests that target cell sensitivity may be the most important factor in determining the entity of biological response to the antigenic challenge. The ability of H. pylori to induce a specific IgE immune response could answer key questions regarding the mechanisms inducing gastric inflammation. \nPersonality traits in the mechanisms of interferential therapy for osteoarthritic knee pain. The role of hypochondriacal, depressive, and hysterical personality traits in response to interferential therapy (IFT) was studied in 50 patients with chronic knee osteoarthrosis. Personality traits were assessed through the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Each patient received ten sessions of IFT during two weeks. Pain relief was assessed subjectively (with a numerical pain-relief scale) at the end of treatment and one week later in a single-blind method. Patients who experienced pain relief of 50% or more were considered responders (n = 22). Those who experienced pain relief of 25% or less were considered nonresponders (n = 24). No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups on any of the personality traits studied. These personality traits apparently have no effect on the response of osteoarthritic knee pain to IFT. \nHuman gallbladder morphology after gallstone dissolution with methyl tert-butyl ether. The effects of methyl tert-butyl ether exposure on the human gallbladder in five patients who were treated for gallstones by contact dissolution is described. Two patients underwent cholecystectomy within 1 week of methyl tert-butyl ether treatment, one patient 2 weeks after, another 10 weeks after, and one 12 weeks after. Indications for cholecystectomy were bilirubinate stones (resistant to methyl tert-butyl ether), catheter dislodgement, bile leakage, and gallstone recurrence (2 patients). Gallstones were dissolved completely in three patients, there was approximately 50% stone reduction in one patient, and no dissolution occurred in the fifth patient. Each gallbladder was examined grossly and histologically. Electron microscopic evaluation was performed in one cases. Typical inflammatory findings of chronic cholecystitis were observed in each gallbladder and were most conspicuous in the submucosa; the mucosal and serosal surfaces were intact. Mild acute inflammatory changes were noted in the submucosa in the two patients with the shortest interval between methyl tert-butyl ether administration and cholecystectomy. There were no ulcerations in the mucosa and no unusual wall thickening or fibrosis in any patient. These observations support the safety of methyl tert-butyl ether perfusion in the human gallbladder; the mild acute changes may be a transient and reversible phenomenon. \nExtensive hepatic granulomas associated with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. A case of T-cell lymphoma presenting with marked hepatosplenomegaly and extensive hepatic granulomas is described. A 55-yr-old female experienced long-term liver damage showing histological triaditis with atypical lymphoid cell infiltration and erythrophagocytosis. The patient developed marked hepatosplenomegaly and eventually died of respiratory failure. Neither systemic lymphadenopathy nor hematological disorder was noted until her death. Autopsy revealed small atypical lymphoid cells positive for T-cell marker, as well as extensive infiltration of generalized organs, including the liver, spleen, and lungs. As a result of diffuse proliferation of atypical lymphoid cell admixed with variable reactive cells, mainly at the T-zone, the lymph nodes underwent effacement of normal architecture; however, the peripheral sinuses and the fibrous capsule remained relatively well preserved. These histological features were consistent with a diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL). It is interesting to note that there were numerous epithelioid granulomas admixed with a small number of atypical lymphoid cells within the hepatic parenchyma. The atypical lymphoid cells may be responsible for the granulomatous reaction in the liver. To our knowledge, there have been no other reported cases of PTL that presented with numerous epithelioid granulomas confined to the liver. \nAggressive malignant hemangiopericytoma in the neck. Hemangiopericytomas are rare vascular tumors, one fourth of which occur in the head and neck. These lesions are characteristically slow growing and slow to metastasize. We describe an otherwise healthy patient with a hemangiopericytoma on the left side of his neck that metastasized to his chest wall within 3 months after the tumor was first observed. The metastasis occurred while the patient was receiving radiation therapy. The patient died soon afterward. This case illustrates the aggressive malignant potential of hemangiopericytomas. \nImmunization response varies with intensity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy. Twenty-four children receiving maintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were given booster doses of tetanus-diphtheria combined toxoids. One month later, 19 of the 24 children were given Haemophilus influenzae B oligosaccharide-cross-reacting material conjugate vaccine. Following immunization, all patients had protective antibody titers against tetanus, 92% had protective antidiphtheria titers, and 84% had protective titers against H influenzae. Preimmunization titers, postimmunization titers, and response to immunization varied according to the intensity of therapy. There was no correlation with duration of therapy or quantitative hematologic values in the peripheral blood. These observations support the recommendation that children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia should be immunized against H influenzae B. \nAnomalous insertion of papillary muscle directly into anterior mitral leaflet in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Significance in producing left ventricular outflow obstruction. BACKGROUND. Obstruction to left ventricular outflow in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is usually due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Occurrence of structural mitral valve abnormalities in HCM and their significance in producing outflow obstruction (even in the absence of typical systolic anterior motion) has not been fully appreciated. METHODS AND RESULTS. Analysis of 78 mitral valves excised from patients with obstructive HCM showed that 10 (13%) had anomalous insertion of one or both left ventricular papillary muscles directly into the anterior mitral leaflet. This malformation was identified by echocardiography, which demonstrated direct continuity between the hypertrophied papillary muscle and mitral leaflet, resulting in a long rigid area of midcavity narrowing that appeared to be solely or largely responsible for outflow obstruction. Basal subaortic pressure gradients were large (70-150 mm Hg). Mitral valve replacement reduced the outflow gradient substantially to 0-15 mm Hg in four patients with postoperative cardiac catheterization. However, two other patients who underwent septal myotomy/myectomy had persistent symptoms and incomplete relief of obstruction (gradients 60 and 70 mm Hg) because of continued midcavity apposition of papillary muscle and ventricular septum. CONCLUSIONS. Anomalous papillary muscle insertion into anterior mitral leaflet represents a mechanism of obstruction to left ventricular outflow in patients with HCM and differs considerably from typical dynamic obstruction caused by mitral valve systolic anterior motion that occurs in many other patients with HCM. Recognition of this malformation emphasizes the diverse morphological expression of HCM and also has important clinical implications for patients requiring operation because the gradient is likely to persist even after adequate myotomy/myectomy; consequently, mitral valve replacement would appear to be the operation of choice in most such patients. \nCoronary stenting with a new, radiopaque, balloon-expandable endoprosthesis in pigs. BACKGROUND. Intracoronary stents may be effective when used as \"bail-out\" devices for acute complications after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Furthermore, preliminary reports have demonstrated some promising results with stents with regard to the reduction of restenosis. Several stent devices are available for preclinical and clinical evaluation. The use of these stainless-steel stents has been limited by poor visibility during fluoroscopy and thrombogenicity during the first days to weeks after implantation. We therefore investigated the immediate and short-term effects on arterial patency of a new, radiopaque, balloon-expandable coil stent in normal coronary arteries of pigs. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 10 animals, a stent was placed in two of the three epicardial coronary arteries. During the implantation procedure, the animals received heparin; after the procedure, no antithrombotic drugs were administered. After 1 week (five animals and 10 stents) or 4 weeks (five animals and 10 stents), repeat angiography was performed, followed by pressure-fixation of the coronary arteries for light and electron microscopic examination. Angiographic analysis revealed that all stented coronary segments were patent and without signs of intraluminal defects. Scanning electron microscopy showed complete endothelial covering of all stents within 7 days. Light microscopy showed a reduced tunica media locally under the stent wires, which resulted from exerted pressure. The neointima on top of the stent wires measured 56 microns (range, 42-88 microns) after 1 week and 139 microns (range, 84-250 microns) after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS. Results from this study show that this radiopaque endoprosthesis can be safely placed in normal coronary arteries of pigs. After 4 weeks, all stents were patent and there was no need for additional antithrombotic treatment, whereas neointimal proliferation was limited. \nFocal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: assessment with contrast-enhanced TurboFLASH MR imaging. Twenty-two patients with 25 cases of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) proved with pathologic study were imaged with a TurboFLASH (fast low angle shot) sequence combined with bolus administration of gadolinium tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid (DOTA), spin-echo (SE) T2-weighted sequences, and postcontrast T1-weighted sequences. FNH-liver signal-difference-to-noise ratios were quantified; the features of the central scar were qualitatively analyzed. On SE T2-weighted images, all FNHs were hyperintense; in two cases the central scar exhibited a high signal intensity associated with hypointense areas corresponding to fibrous tissue within the branches of the scar. Unenhanced TurboFLASH images always demonstrated the FNHs as hypointense and always depicted the central scar as a hypointense area within the lesion. After bolus injection, arterial enhancement of FNH was clearly seen, and in 10 of 25 lesions, enhancement within the scar was seen 40-80 seconds after injection. Both unenhanced and enhanced TurboFLASH sequences produced the best signal-difference-to-noise ratios in comparison with T2-weighted images. \nSolitary extradural cavernous hemangiomas in the spinal canal. Report of five cases. Five cases of solitary extrathecal cavernous hemangioma in the spinal canal are reported. In one case, two coexistent massive cerebral venous medullary malformations were found. The symptomatology and prognosis of extrathecal spinal cavernous hemangiomas are discussed, as is the significance of various diagnostic measures. The patient material further permitted a rough calculation of the incidence of symptomatic extrathecal cavernous hemangiomas in the spinal canal. \nAdverse psychologic consequences of positive cytologic cervical screening. Cervical cancer is still widely prevalent in the female population. This study explores the relationship of cervical cancer screening, positive versus negative Papanicolaou's test results, and psychologic status among lower-income minority women. All patients were interviewed 3 months after they had received initial test results. One hundred six women with normal Papanicolaou's test results were compared with 118 women who were referred for colposcopic examination for follow-up of positive test results. Women with positive Papanicolaou's-test results showed statistically significant elevations in worries about cancer and impairments in mood, daily activities, sexual interest, and sleep patterns. More fine-grained analyses revealed that the effects of positive results were most pronounced among those women who did not comply with colposcopy (n = 53). These findings suggest that lack of compliance with follow-up may maintain high levels of uncertainty about disease and may interfere with successful psychologic adaptation. Health education targeted to psychologically vulnerable individuals may reduce psychologic distress and enhance compliance. \nHypothyroidism resulting from generic levothyroxine failure. In today's cost-conscious health care system, generic preparations should be prescribed whenever possible provided that safety and efficacy are not compromised. Several reports, however, suggest that generic levothyroxine may not always be interchangeable with the proprietary preparations. Such interchangeability is critical because patients are likely to receive different brands of levothyroxine during the life of their treatment. We report a case of severe hypothyroidism that developed in a patient who had been well controlled before receiving a generic levothyroxine preparation. Analysis of the patient's tablet by high-pressure liquid chromatography showed that the levothyroxine content was approximately 30 percent less than its labeled content and outside current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. It is likely that poor tablet bioavailability was a contributory factor. Euthyroidism was achieved with the same dose of a more potent and possibly more bioavailable brand-name product. Until levothyroxine products become more uniform and the FDA confers therapeutic equivalence, product substitution with expense as the principal consideration should be avoided. \nRisk factors for pancreatic cellular injury after cardiopulmonary bypass BACKGROUND. Pancreatitis is a known complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Although ischemia is believed to be a factor, the cause of pancreatitis after cardiopulmonary bypass remains unknown. METHODS. We prospectively studied 300 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Serum amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, and serum lipase were measured on postoperative days 1,2,3,7, and 10. Pancreatic cellular injury was defined as the presence of hyperamylasemia (greater than 123 U per liter) with an increase in either the serum level of lipase (greater than 24 U per liter) or the peak level of pancreatic isoamylase. Trypsinogen-activation peptides, which indicate intrapancreatic enzyme activation, were measured in the urine of the last 101 patients studied. RESULTS. Evidence of pancreatic cellular injury was detected in 80 patients (27 percent), of whom 23 had associated abdominal signs or symptoms and 3 had severe pancreatitis (2 with pancreatic abscess and 1 with necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis). Two of 19 postoperative deaths were secondary to pancreatitis. In multivariate analyses, the development of pancreatic cellular injury was significantly associated with preoperative renal insufficiency, valve surgery, postoperative hypotension, and perioperative administration of calcium chloride. The administration of more than 800 mg of calcium chloride per square meter of body-surface area was an independent predictor of pancreatic cellular injury, and the increase in risk was dose-related. No differences were found in the level of trypsinogen-activation peptides between patients who had pancreatic cellular injury and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS. Pancreatic cellular injury, as indicated by hyperamylasemia of pancreatic origin, is common after cardiac surgery. The administration of large doses of calcium chloride is an independent predictor of pancreatic cellular injury and may be a cause of it. \nThe golden hours of the myocardial infarction: nonthrombolytic interventions. Emergency care of patients with acute myocardial infarction requires active decision making to use agents that may improve morbidity and mortality. Thrombolysis remains the primary tool to accomplish this goal. Other pharmacologic agents, including lidocaine, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and aspirin, have been used acutely in myocardial infarction in the hopes of preventing death and salvaging myocardium. The decision to select one or all of these agents requires a knowledge of the clinical evidence of their efficacy and risk-to-benefit ratios. The clinical studies of the use of these agents acutely in the management of myocardial infarction are reviewed. \nLower limb problems in diabetic patients. What are the causes? What are the remedies? Peripheral neuropathy, infection, and peripheral vascular disease can produce serious problems in diabetic patients, particularly in the lower limbs. Ulceration of the foot may progress to gangrene and ultimately necessitate amputation. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy causes sensory loss. Such loss in patients with peripheral vascular disease creates a high risk for foot ulcers, which are vulnerable to infection. Treatment includes relief of neuropathic pain and antibiotic therapy for infection. Pentoxifylline (Trental) improves microvascular flow and appears to be effective against peripheral vascular disease. Aldose reductase inhibitors are being investigated as therapy for diabetic neuropathy. Prevention is the mainstay of management in these patients. Patient education is essential to help maintain health and prevent the potential adverse effects of diabetes. \nAssessment of 21-[18F]fluoro-16 alpha-ethyl-19-norprogesterone as a positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical for the detection of progestin receptors in human breast carcinomas. We have used 21-[18F]fluoro-16 alpha-ethyl-19-norprogesterone (FENP) for imaging progestin receptors by PET in patients with primary carcinoma of the breast. In vitro binding and in vivo tissue distribution studies in rats have shown that FENP has high specific activity, high affinity for progestin receptors, and receptor-mediated uptake in target tissues. Eight patients with primary breast carcinoma were studied. Breast carcinoma was identified correctly in 50% of the patients with progestin-receptor-positive tumors; however, the FENP uptake was not correlated with progestin-receptor levels. We noted a low target-to-background ratio in humans, with high relative activity in the spine, blood pool, and normal breast tissue. Our findings indicate that FENP is not a suitable agent for imaging progestin receptors in humans. \nComparison of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone in acute myocardial infarction. Urochinasi per via Sistemica nell'Infarto Miocardico (USIM) Collaborative Group. In a randomized trial of the effects on in-hospital mortality of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone, 2,531 patients with acute myocardial infarction in 89 coronary care units were enrolled for greater than 30 months. Patients admitted within 4 hours of the onset of pain were randomized to receive either intravenous urokinase (a bolus dose of 1 million U repeated after 60 minutes) plus heparin (a bolus dose of 10,000 U followed by 1,000 IU/hour for 48 hours) or heparin alone (infused at the same rate). Complete data were obtained in 2,201 patients (1,128 taking urokinase and 1,073 taking heparin). At 16 days, overall hospital mortality was 8% in the urokinase and 8.3% in the heparin group (p = not significant). Among patients with anterior infarction, mortality was 10.3% in the urokinase and 13.9% in the heparin group (p = 0.09; relative risk = 0.73). The incidence of major bleeding (urokinase 0.44%, heparin 0.37%) as well as the overall incidence of stroke (urokinase 0.35%, heparin 0.20%) was similar in the 2 groups. The rates of major in-hospital cardiac complications (reinfarction, postinfarction angina) were also similar. \nA case report of malignant pleural mesothelioma with long-term disease control after chemotherapy. Long duration of responses to chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is rare. The authors report a patient with inoperable MPM who achieved complete remission with combination chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C (FM) induced another remission after recurrence of the tumor. Retreatment with FM after chemotherapy had been stopped for 20 months yielded another continuing response. The overall tumor-control time is more than 4 years. Literature reviews and the authors' results suggest that MPM may be a chemosensitive tumor in some patients. Additional evaluations of CAP, FM, and methotrexate combination regimens in this disease should be considered. \nTonic pain perception in the mouse: differential modulation by three receptor-selective opioid agonists. The proposition that tonic nociception models are more analogous to clinical pain than traditional acute models prompted our previous development of a modified mouse paw formalin test. To discern possible modulatory roles and site(s) of action of endogenous opioid systems, the receptor-preferring agonists sufentanil (mu), U-50,488H (kappa) and [D-Pen2,5]enkephalin (DPDPE, delta) were evaluated for antinociceptive activity in the formalin paradigm by systemic (except DPDPE), spinal and supraspinal routes. All observations were done under blind conditions. Doses causing overt behaviors that indicated a breach of receptor specificity (during the observation period) were rejected. Higher doses of centrally administered DPDPE (greater than 0.3 micrograms/mouse, intrathecal; greater than 3 micrograms/mouse, intracerebroventricular) induced a behavioral syndrome traditionally associated with mu agonism, and thus were not considered for this study. A50 values from behaviorally acceptable dose ranges for mean percent analgesia (reduction of paw licking compared to controls) were: trans-(+/- )-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[U-50,488H 2-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate,U-50,488H--3200 nmol/kg, subcutaneous, 1100 nmol/kg, intrathecal and 314 nmol/kg, intracerebroventricular; sufentanil--11.1 nmol/kg, subcutaneous, 8.6 nmol/kg, intrathecal; and DPDPE--inactive. On the basis of our dose-response data, we suggest that, in mice, kappa and mu, but not delta, opioid receptors modulate tonic pain perception at both spinal and supraspinal loci. The results also support inclusion of the modified formalin test in preclinical evaluations of potential kappa agonists. \nMyocardial infarct size reduction by the synergistic effect of hyperbaric oxygen and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Fasting mongrel dogs underwent hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment, and simultaneous HBOT and rt-PA treatment following prior experimental left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 2 hours. Thrombosis in and around a copper coil was recorded angiographically at regular intervals, and immediately prior to treatment conclusion. Controls (n = 10) were untreated. Group two animals (n = 10) were treated additionally with 90 minutes of HBOT at 2 atm absolute. Group three animals (n = 8) were treated additionally with 50 mg rt-PA over 90 minutes. Group four animals (n = 10) were treated additionally with simultaneous HBOT and rt-PA over 90 minutes. Myocardial injury was determined by a combination of triphenyltetrazolium chloride histochemical staining and by formazan dye extraction. Damage was measured as a percent of left ventricular cross-sectional area studied. HBOT alone restored 35.9% of oxidative enzyme activity (p greater than 0.001). Treatment with rt-PA alone restored 48.9% of enzyme activity (p greater than 0.001). The combination of HBOT and simultaneous rt-PA resulted in 96.9% restoration of oxidative enzyme activity versus the control group (p greater than 0.001). \nSequence variations in the 5' flanking and IVS-II regions of the G gamma- and A gamma-globin genes of beta S chromosomes with five different haplotypes. We have amplified and sequenced the 5' flanking and the second intervening sequence (IVS-II) regions of both the G gamma- and A gamma-globin genes of the beta S chromosomes from sickle cell anemia (SS) patients with homozygosities for five different haplotypes. The sequencing data, compared with previously published sequences for the normal chromosomes A and B, show many similarities to chromosome B for haplotypes 19, 20, and 17, while haplotypes 3 and 31 are remarkably similar to chromosome A and also similar to each other. Several unique mutations were found in the 5' flanking regions (G gamma and A gamma) of haplotypes 19 and 20 and in the IVS-II segments of the same genes of haplotypes 19, 20, and 17; the IVS-II of haplotypes 3 and 31 were identical to those of chromosome A. Dot-blot analyses of amplified DNA from additional SS patients with specific probes have confirmed that these mutations are unique for each haplotype. The two general patterns that have been observed among the five haplotypes have most probably arisen by gene conversion events between the A and B type chromosomes in the African population. These patterns correlate with high and low fetal hemoglobin expression, and it is speculated that these and other yet unknown gene conversions may contribute to the variations in hemoglobin F and G gamma levels observed among SS patients. In vitro expression experiments involving the approximately 1.3-kb 5' flanking regions of the G gamma- and A gamma-globin genes of the beta S chromosomes with the five different haplotypes failed to detect differences between the levels of expression, suggesting that the sequence variations observed between these segments of DNA are not the primary cause of the differences in hemoglobin F levels among the SS patients. \nLeft ventricular regional wall motion assessment by radionuclide ventriculography: a comparison of cine display with Fourier imaging Radionuclide ventriculography and contrast ventriculography were performed in two comparable projections on 50 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The efficacy of conventional cine display and Fourier image analysis of the radionuclide ventriculogram was compared using contrast ventriculography as the gold standard. Of seven different combinations of Fourier images, the combination of left anterior oblique amplitude and phase and left posterior oblique amplitude and phase provided the highest sensitivity (87%), specificity (83%), accuracy (86%), and kappa coefficient (0.64). To increase statistical power, segment data were collapsed to global data in which a heart was considered normal if all segments were normal and abnormal if one or more segments were abnormal. Fourier images had higher sensitivity (Fourier 87%, cine 47%); lower specificity (Fourier 83%, cine 92%), higher accuracy (Fourier 86%, cine 58%), and higher kappa coefficient (Fourier 0.64, cine 0.25), and these differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.01). \nVariable histotoxicity of histoacryl when used in a subcutaneous site: an experimental study. Histoacryl (butyl-2-cyanoacrylate) is one of the least histotoxic cyanoacrylate derivatives and is used as a tissue adhesive. Clinical applications primarily include skin closure (blepharoplasty incisions, etc.). In a recent study, we demonstrated that Histoacryl elicits minimal histotoxicity when used to glue bone grafts to rabbit-ear cartilage. Acute inflammation was limited to areas where Histoacryl escaped from between the bone graft and ear cartilage to contact well-vascularized soft tissue. In this study, Histoacryl was applied between bone graft and cartilage in one rabbit ear and adjacent to well-vascularized soft tissue with no graft in the opposite ear. Histologic analysis revealed minimal if any inflammation when small amounts of glue was used in the nonvascular region between bone graft and cartilage. However, subcutaneous implantation contacting well-vascularized soft tissue resulted in increased acute inflammation and prolonged foreign-body giant-cell response. Further studies are required to rule out any long-term problems associated with subcutaneous implantation of Histoacryl. \nStroke and hypertension and its prevention. Systolic and diastolic hypertension in both men and women is a well-established risk factor for the development of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Antihypertensive treatment decreases the risk, but questions remain as to the precise level of hypertension to be treated, whether the effects of antihypertensive treatment are blunted with increasing age, and the best type of antihypertensive drug or combination of drugs to be used. Further questions remain concerning the incidence of pseudohypertension and the potentially harmful effects of its treatment on the brain, and the possibility that fluctuations in blood pressure may be worse than elevation alone. A pragmatic approach would be to treat hypertension with vigor in the young, with caution in the mature, and with reluctance in the old. \nManagement options in fulminant hepatic failure. The diagnosis of FHF carries with it a high mortality rate. Though the early results of OLT for FHF are encouraging, some have called for caution as these results are in a select population and may be similar to the optimistic early reports of now-discredited therapies. However, OLT differs fundamentally from all other interventions and, as such, it is ethically unjustified to withhold potentially life-saving therapy from patients with a predicted mortality in excess of 60%. Therefore, patients with FHF should be transferred at an early stage to an experienced liver unit where the option of liver transplantation can be considered. \nPredictors of relapse into major depressive disorder in a nonclinical population. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to describe, the natural history of major depressive disorder in a large group of nonclinical subjects. In particular, the analysis determined demographic and clinical risk factors for the recurrence of major depressive disorder. METHOD: Relatives, comparison subjects (matched to relatives for age and sex), and spouses of affectively ill probands underwent structured clinical assessments before and after a 6-year interval. RESULTS: Of 396 individuals who had had only major depressive disorder that ended before the initial evaluation, 33.8% (N = 134) developed a new episode during the 6-year follow-up period. Youth, but not sex, was an important demographic risk factor. The presence of minor depression at the time of initial evaluation and the number of symptoms recalled from the worst previous episode were additional clinical risk factors. At the initial evaluation, 200 other subjects had described a previous history of both major depressive disorder and a nonaffective mental disorder. When compared to the subjects who recalled only a history of major depressive disorder, these subjects were more likely to have been in an episode of chronic intermittent depression at the initial evaluation and to recall a greater number of episodes as well as a greater number of symptoms in the worst episode. A history of a nonaffective mental disorder significantly increased the risk of relapse into major depressive disorder. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree well with a recent review of clinically based follow-up studies. Thus, youth and a history of nonaffective illness are important risk factors for the recurrence of major affective disorder in a broad variety of settings. \nPostoperative epidural morphine is safe on surgical wards. The use of epidural morphine for postoperative analgesia outside of intensive care units remains controversial. In this report our anesthesiology-based acute pain service documents experience with 1,106 consecutive postoperative patients treated with epidural morphine on regular surgical wards. This experience involved 4,343 total patient days of care and 11,089 individual epidural morphine injections. On a 0-10 verbal analog scale, patient-reported median pain scores at rest and with coughing or ambulation were 1 (inter-quartile range 3) and 4 (interquartile range 4), respectively. The incidence of side effects requiring medication were as follows: pruritus 24%, nausea 29%, and respiratory depression 0.2%. There were no deaths, neurologic injuries, or infections associated with the technique. Migration of epidural catheters into the subarachnoid space and into epidural veins each occurred twice. Overall, 1,051 of the 1,106 patients (95%) experienced none of the following problems: catheter obstruction, premature dislodgement, painful injections, catheter migration, infection, or respiratory depression. We conclude that postoperative pain can be safely and effectively treated with epidural morphine on surgical wards. \nRecombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoid cancer. BACKGROUND. The period of neutropenia after autologous bone marrow transplantation results in substantial morbidity and mortality. The results of previous phase I-II clinical trials suggest that recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) may accelerate neutrophil recovery and thereby reduce complications in patients after autologous bone marrow transplantation. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at three institutions. The study design and treatment schedules were identical, and the results were pooled for analysis. One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Sixty-five patients received rhGM-CSF in a two-hour intravenous infusion daily for 21 days, starting within four hours of the marrow infusion, and 63 patients received placebo. RESULTS. No toxic effects specifically ascribed to rhGM-CSF were observed. The patients given rhGM-CSF had a recovery of the neutrophil count to 500 x 10(6) per liter 7 days earlier than the patients who received placebo (19 vs. 26 days, P less than 0.001), had fewer infections, required 3 fewer days of antibiotic administration (24 vs. 27 days, P = 0.009), and required 6 fewer days of initial hospitalization (median, 27 vs. 33 days; P = 0.01). There was no difference in the survival rate at day 100. CONCLUSIONS. In patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoid neoplasia, rhGM-CSF significantly lessens morbidity. Further studies will be required to establish its optimal dosage and schedule of administration. \nFrequency of deep venous thrombosis in asymptomatic patients with coronary artery bypass grafts. The frequency of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery has not been established. Therefore to estimate the frequency of clinically silent DVT, we performed ultrasound examinations of the leg veins in 29 asymptomatic CABG patients before hospital discharge. We used high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography with color Doppler imaging. Fourteen (48.3%, 95% confidence interval 30.1 to 66.4%) had 20 documented leg vein thromboses, and all but one patient had DVT limited to the calf veins. Of the 20 thrombi 10 (50.0%) were present in the leg ipsilateral and 10 (50.0%) in the leg contralateral to the saphenous vein harvest site. None of the DVTs were suspected clinically. DVT was not associated with any local sign attributed to saphenous vein harvest such as pitting edema, incisional drainage, or local tenderness or with any putative risk factor for DVT such as cigarette use, distant history of malignancy, or varicose veins. Follow-up of these patients 5 to 11 months after CABG surgery showed no clinical evidence of DVT or pulmonary embolism. Our findings indicate that asymptomatic DVT of the calf occurs with surprisingly high frequency, 44.8% after CABG surgery. Future studies in patients undergoing CABG surgery should address the natural history of asymptomatic DVT, determine its clinical importance, and develop optimal strategies for prophylaxis and treatment. \nExpansion of immature thymic precursor cells in peripheral blood after acute marrow suppression. Leukemoid reactions occur in response to a number of infectious agents and sometimes may be associated with bone marrow suppression. After acute suppression of the bone marrow, a resurgent hyperplasia occurs that may appear as synchronous maturation of a single cell type. The authors describe the case of a 13-year-old child in whom a remarkable lymphocytosis developed during a period of pancytopenia associated with a febrile syndrome resembling Ehrlichiosis. Most of these lymphoid cells were morphologically similar to large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), but many appeared to be less mature. Immunophenotypic studies demonstrated most of these lymphoid cells to be immature T cells at an \"intermediate\" or \"transitional\" stage of thymocyte differentiation characterized by the CD1-CD3+CD4-CD8- phenotype, as well as positivity for nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. In T-cell ontogeny, this stage represents a transition between thymic precursors and mature thymocytes. Their presence in the peripheral blood of this child is thought to represent a lymphocytic leukemoid response to his infection. Cases such as this may be confused with malignancy. \nPreventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Severe upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious adverse effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the elderly are at increased risk of developing this complication. Bleeding episodes can be prevented. Replacing NSAIDs with acetaminophen may be appropriate when a simple analgesic is needed that eliminates the risk of GI bleeding. Using the lowest effective NSAID dose may decrease the incidence and severity of NSAID gastropathy. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists, sucralfate, and misoprostol have been studied for the prevention of NSAID gastropathy, but only misoprostol prevents mucosal injury in both the stomach and duodenum. Patients who have a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastric bleeding from NSAIDs are candidates for prophylactic measures. Although other patients are at risk, no one knows who should receive prophylactic therapy for NSAID gastropathy. Future studies should attempt to define patient populations that warrant prophylactic therapy. \nAn analysis of ten-year trends in infections in adults on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Infectious complications are the Achilles heel of CAPD. To determine trends in these events, we analyzed the CAPD related infections of 303 adults on CAPD at a single university center between 1979 and 1989. During this decade the percentage of insulin-dependent diabetics increased from 14% to 39% (p less than 0.005). Peritonitis rates fell from 2.4 episodes/y in 1979 to 0.8 episodes/y in 1989. The proportion of patients with multiple episodes of peritonitis decreased (40% of the patients in 1979-1982 vs 15% in 1983-1989, p = 0.0001) while the proportion of patients with no episodes of peritonitis increased during the same periods (29% vs 49%, p = 0.005). The proportion of peritonitis episodes due to S. aureus rose over the 10-year period (p = 0.005), while those due to S. epidermidis decreased (p less than 0.10). The overall incidence of S. aureus peritonitis remained unchanged. Catheter infection rates initially increased and then fell during the decade; S. aureus remained the predominant cause. The proportion of peritonitis episodes associated with catheter infection rose (13% in 1982 vs 24% in 1989, p = 0.025), and in 1989, 80% of these episodes were caused by S. aureus. Catheter loss was also primarily due to S. aureus infections in 1989 (80%). Infections due to P. aeruginosa were a persistent problem. The proportion of patients transferring to hemodialysis each year paralleled catheter loss rates, which in turn appeared to be more related to catheter infection rates than to peritonitis rates. We conclude that control of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa will be the key to future reductions in the infectious complications of CAPD patients. \nThe silence: the asbestos industry and early occupational cancer research--a case study. To gain insight into corporate activities regarding the identification of occupational carcinogens earlier in this century, the actions of one industry, the asbestos industry, were reviewed. This industry, in concert with many of its insurers, systematically developed and then suppressed information on the carcinogenicity of asbestos. The development of warnings for those exposed to the asbestos was delayed. As a result, millions of workers were exposed to the carcinogen and hundreds of thousands died. These events are placed into the context of similar activities in other industries during this time. \nCoronary artery bypass grafting in the octogenarian. We have performed coronary bypass grafting in 25 patients 80 years of age or more. The patients' preoperative conditions were characterized by recent myocardial infarction (16/25, or 64%), obesity (15/25, or 60%), hypertension (14/25, or 56%), and left ventricular dysfunction (21/25, or 84%). There were no deaths in the hospital or within 30 days of operation (0/25, or 0%). Postoperative complications occurred in five cases (20%). Complications were leg incision infection (2/25, or 8%), urinary tract infection (1/25, or 4%), stroke (1/25, or 4%), and transient neurologic deficit (1/25, or 4%). There were no instances of reoperation for bleeding, perioperative myocardial infarction, renal failure, pulmonary failure, intraaortic balloon pump use, or sternotomy infection in these patients. Eleven patients (44%) were hospitalized for fewer than 10 days after operation, and all but two (23/25, or 92%) were discharged within 20 days after operation. All patients were followed up, and survival and New York Heart Association functional class were determined. Cumulative survival rate was 94% at 1 year and 88% at 5 years. The cumulative percent survival rate with class I or II function was 92% at 1 year and 80% at 5 years. No patient had recurrent angina. \nMyocardial oedema and ventricular function after cardioplegia with added mannitol. Myocardial oedema may contribute to the impaired myocardial performance which commonly follows open heart surgery with cardioplegia-induced cardiac arrest. The rate of oedema formation during crystalloid cardioplegia and the relation of this to changes in ventricular compliance and ventricular function following reperfusion were studied using an isolated rabbit heart preparation. Myocardial tissue water content increased during cardioplegic arrest and the water content prior to reperfusion demonstrated an inverse correlation with ventricular function after reperfusion. In further studies the effect of adding mannitol to a standard crystalloid cardioplegic solution was investigated. The preparations were divided into two groups: nine were administered a standard cardioplegic solution (Plegisol*) (control group) and a further eight were administered the same solution mixed with mannitol to adjust the osmotic pressure to 360 mOsmol.L-3 (mannitol group). The mannitol group demonstrated less increase in RV water content and superior LV dP/dtmax following reperfusion. It is concluded that mannitol enhances protection of the myocardium during cardioplegic cardiac arrest. \nSternohyoid muscle biopsy. A diagnostic technique in respiratory failure of neuromuscular origin. Patients with neuromuscular disease may develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. We describe a sternohyoid muscle biopsy technique as a diagnostic aid in such patients undergoing tracheostomy for prolonged ventilatory support. The biopsy procedure is quick and without added discomfort or morbidity for the patient. Our preliminary observations in three patients suggest that the sternohyoid muscle biopsy may be a useful diagnostic tool in this selected group of patients. \nMechanical complications associated with mentor inflatable penile prosthesis. The Mentor inflatable penile prosthesis was developed in an attempt to decrease the mechanical failure rate of the various prostheses' components. We herein report on the reliability of the device in 46 men implanted with the Mentor device from December 1982 to June 1987. Prior to manufacturer device modification in 1985, mechanical failure mainly attributable to input tubing cracks occurred in 10 of 30 implantations. Since device improvement in April 1985, the mechanical failure rate has decreased to 4 percent. The Mentor inflatable penile prosthesis has been a mechanically reliable device since design improvement in 1985. \nPituitary hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone in secondary amenorrheic women associated with simple weight loss. OBJECTIVE: To investigate endocrine dysfunction in simple weight loss amenorrhea. DESIGN: We studied pituitary hormone responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in 10 women with simple weight loss amenorrhea. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital, University of Tokushima at Tokushima, Japan. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Secondary amenorrheic women associated with simple weight loss who did not have anorexia nervosa. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous injection of 500 micrograms of synthetic TRH. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyrotropin, and prolactin were measured before and 15, 30, and 60 minutes after TRH injection. RESULTS: In normally menstruating women on day 7 of the cycle TRH did not affect serum LH and FSH levels. In women with simple weight loss amenorrhea, however, TRH raised serum LH and FSH levels significantly (P less than 0.01, respectively). Prolactin response to TRH was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in women with simple weight loss amenorrhea than in normally menstruating women. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that TRH causes a significant rise in serum LH and FSH and the impaired prolactin response in women with simple weight loss amenorrhea. \nRisk factors in relation to postoperative complications and mortality after total gastrectomy in aged patients. To clarify the risk factors contributing to postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing total gastrectomy, 84 patients with primary gastric cancer were evaluated. Twenty-seven patients were older than 65 years of age; they had much more preoperative cardiac (P = 0.00003), respiratory (P = 0.0008), and multiorgan impairment (P = 0.009) than did the control group (age less than 65 yrs). Although overall morbidities (44.4% vs. 19.2%; P = 0.01) and overall septic complication rates (33.3% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.02) were higher in aged patients, no significant differences between the two groups were found in the incidence of major surgical complications (18.5% in aged patients vs. 10.5% in control groups; P = NS), serious septic (sepsis score greater than 10) complications (18.5% vs. 7.0%; P = NS) and hospital mortalities (11.1% vs. 3.5%; P = NS). In older patients the occurrence of multiorgan impairment and malnutrition was significantly related to postoperative complication rates. These results suggest that the degree of organ impairment rather than age is predictive of postoperative difficulty and should be used in assessing preoperative risk. \nInterferon gamma response region in the promoter of the human DPA gene. The interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) response region of the human class II major histocompatibility complex gene, DPA, has been localized to a 52-base-pair (bp) DNA fragment in the proximal promotor at -107 to -55 bp after transfection into HeLa cells of a series of 5', 3', and gap deletion mutants linked to a reporter gene, human growth hormone, as well as of synthetic oligonucleotides fused to the heterologous promoter thymidine kinase. The 52-mer sequence contains the X and Y box elements conserved in all class II genes; their presence is indispensable for IFN-gamma inducibility. Furthermore, an additional 5 bp immediately 5' of the X box of the DPA gene are necessary and sufficient for IFN-gamma induction. This region may contain an IFN-gamma response element. A closely related sequence has also been found in the vicinity of the critical deletion sites of three other well-studied class II gene promoters, all of which require a much longer sequence 5' of the X box. A fourth element, the W element, located about 15 bp 5' of the X box in all class II genes, is clearly of little importance in IFN-gamma inducibility of the DPA gene. \nMicrovascular permeability increases early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury. To test the hypothesis that microvascular injury is involved in the pathophysiology of acid-induced esophagitis, the effect of acid perfusion on intraluminal plasma protein loss was studied in relation to histological changes. Four groups of opossums (n = 6 in each) were perfused with either normal saline control) or 10, 20, or 100 mmol/L isoosmolar hydrochloric acid at 2 mL/min for 90 minutes using a midesophageal catheter. The distal esophagus was cannulated via a gastrostomy, and the effluent was collected and measured for intraluminal loss of IV injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. Plasma protein loss in the control group was constant with a total loss of 3.40 +/- 0.69 mg/g dry wt. Perfusion of 10, 20, and 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid increased total protein loss to 8.06 +/- 2.62, 13.94 +/- 2.72, and 27.34 +/- 4.34 mg/g dry wt, respectively. The protein loss was not associated with intraluminal blood loss, as measured by previously injected 51Cr-labeled autologous red blood cells. Histological changes, scored by a blinded observer, were significant only between control animals and those perfused with 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid. Separate studies using the vascular tracer monastral blue B demonstrated an increase in labeling of lamina propria blood vessels that varied directly with the concentration of acid perfusate, thereby providing direct morphological evidence of microvascular injury. These studies suggest that increased microvascular permeability occurs early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury. \nPatterns of gene expression that characterize the colonic mucosa in patients at genetic risk for colonic cancer. We have used a computer-driven scanning and image-processing system to identify a panel of 30 cDNA clones whose pattern of expression in individual biopsy specimens distinguishes the flat, normal-appearing colonic mucosa of patients in two genetic groups at high risk for development of colorectal cancer from that of normal colonic mucosa in low-risk individuals. The two high-risk groups, familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, are indistinguishable based on the pattern of expression of the 30 selected clones. This suggests that the extensive pleiotropic effects of the inherited loci, which may play an important role in the mechanism of increased risk and early onset of the disease, are similar in these populations. \nMolecular genetic considerations in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma tumorigenesis is consistent with a model by which tumorigenesis results if both alleles at the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus (RBI) are altered. Additional genetic evidence strongly suggests that another obligate event in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis is the homozygous alteration of another gene, p53. Both the RB1 gene and p53 have been proposed to act as tumor-suppressor genes, suggesting that, in this instance, tumorigenesis is the result of the loss of gene function of these two genes, rather than a gain of function. \nOvarian cancer screening: potential effect on mortality. Serum tumor markers and ultrasonography are being investigated as possible ovarian cancer screening tests. Data from the United States on ovarian cancer incidence and survival were used to estimate the potential benefit on ovarian cancer mortality from screening tests of various sensitivities. A test with 80% sensitivity could reduce ovarian cancer mortality by 50% if all screening-detected cases were to experience current stage I survival rates; the benefit would be greatest among women aged 45 or older. For each cancer detected there would be at least 50 false-positive screening tests unless test specificity is greater than 98%. If our most optimistic assumptions about screening could be met, then universal periodic screening of women aged 45 to 74 would result in about 5000 additional 5-year survivors of ovarian cancer annually. Uptake of existing screening tests is far less than universal; thus we would expect the impact of any ovarian cancer screening program to fall short of these projections. \nRare presentation of a parapharyngeal schwannoma. Schwannoma, or neurilemmoma, is included in the differential diagnosis of masses in the parapharyngeal space. Schwannomata do not usually cause acute inflammation, and therefore do not tend to present as emergencies as in this case, in which there was acute respiratory embarrassment. \nIntracellular free magnesium and high energy phosphates in the perfused normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rat heart. A 31P NMR study. We have employed 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to examine the relationship between cytosolic free Mg2+ ([Mg2+]in), intracellular pH, high energy phosphates, and genetic hypertension using the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY) as a control and the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as a model for essential hypertension. The mean systolic blood pressures (measured using the tail cuff method) of control and hypertensive rats (aged 7 to 12 weeks) were 113 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- 2 SE, n = 14) and 162 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean +/- 2 SE, n = 17), respectively. Intracellular free Mg2+ levels were significantly depleted in the isolated Langendorff perfused hypertensive rat hearts (452 +/- 39 mumol/L, mean +/- 2 SE, n = 17) compared to control hearts (756 +/- 52 mumol/L, n = 14); however, intracellular pH did not differ in the SHR hearts (7.02 +/- 0.03, mean +/- 2 SE, n = 7) compared with controls (7.03 +/- 0.03, n = 7). Although we could not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the levels of P-creatine or ATP, intracellular Pi was two-fold higher (5.71 +/- 2.28 mmol/L v 2.92 +/- 0.66 mmol/L, n = 4) and the phosphorylation potential, [MgATP]/[MgADP][Pi], was correspondingly lower (3.0 X 10(4) +/- 1.6 x 10(4) v 8.3 X 10(4) +/- 1.4 X 10(4) (mol/L)-1, n = 4) in SHR compared to WKY hearts. These data demonstrate free magnesium depletion in heart muscle and indicate an alteration in cardiac bioenergetics in essential hypertension. \nDirect derivation of conditionally immortal cell lines from an H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mouse. Studies on cell lines have greatly improved our understanding of many important biological questions. Generation of cell lines is facilitated by the introduction of immortalizing oncogenes into cell types of interest. One gene known to immortalize many different cell types in vitro encodes the simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor (T) antigen (TAg). To circumvent the need for gene insertion in vitro to generate cell lines, we created transgenic mice harboring the SV40 TAg gene. Since previous studies have shown that TAg expression in transgenic mice is associated with tumorigenesis and aberrant development, we utilized a thermolabile TAg [from a SV40 strain, tsA58, temperature sensitive (ts) for transformation] to reduce the levels of functional TAg present in vivo. To direct expression to a broad range of tissues, we used the mouse major histocompatibility complex H-2Kb promoter, which is both widely active and can be further induced by interferons. tsA58 TAg mRNA was expressed in tissues of all animals harboring the hybrid construct. Development of all tissues was macroscopically normal except for thymus, which consistently showed hyperplasia. Fibroblast and cytokeratin+ thymic epithelial cultures from these mice were readily established without undergoing crisis and were conditionally immortal in their growth; the degree of conditionality was correlated with the levels of tsA58 TAg detected. One strain of H-2Kb-tsA58 mice has been bred through several generations to homozygosity and transmits a functional copy of the transgene. \nConcomitant medical disease and headache. The treatment of headache disorders in patients with concomitant medical illness constitutes one of the more challenging areas of headache therapy. As new agents are added to our pharmacologic armamentarium, it will become easier to tailor therapy to our patients. The physician who treats the headache patient with concomitant medical illness must be particularly aware of drug side effects and pharmacology in order to prevent a worsening of underlying medical conditions or an exacerbation of headaches. \nUtilizing lung sounds analysis for the evaluation of acute asthma in small children. One of the most difficult aspects of management of acute asthma in the small child is the clinician's inability to quantitate the response or lack of response to bronchodilator agents because of the inability of a child this age to perform objective lung measurements in the acute state. The present study was designed to evaluate bronchodilator responsiveness in children between 2 and 6 years of age with wheezing by means of a computerized lung sound analysis, computer digitized airway phonopneumonography. Children between ages 2 and 6 who were experiencing acute exacerbations of asthma were included in this study population. The 43 children were evaluated by physical examination, pulmonary function testing, if possible, by use of (spirometry or peak flow meter) and transmission of lung sounds to a computer using an electronic stethoscope to obtain a phonopneumograph with sound intensity level determinations during tidal breathing. A control group of 20 known asthmatic patients between the ages of 8 and 52 years who also presented to the office with acute asthma were evaluated similarly. In each of these individuals, a physical examination was followed by complete spirometry as well as computer digitized airway phonopneumonography recordings. Following initial measurements, all patients were treated with nebulized albuterol (0.25 mL in 2 mL of saline). Five minutes after completion of the nebulization all patients were reexamined and repeat pulmonary function tests were performed followed by CDAP recordings. In the study group of children, the mean pretreatment sound intensity level was 1,694 (range 557 to 4,950 SD +/- 745). \nUse of femoral venous catheters in critically ill adults: prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of clinically important complications of femoral venous catheters. DESIGN: Prospective survey of major and minor complications. SETTING: A mixed medical/surgical ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-three patients admitted to the ICU who underwent femoral venous catheterization over a 2-yr period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 150 catheters inserted in 123 patients for a mean duration of 6.4 days. There were no major complications including catheter-related sepsis. Minor complications consisted of arterial puncture (9.3%), local bleeding (10%), and local inflammation (4.7%). Critical care fellows had a significantly lower rate (6%) of insertion complications than interns or medical students (16%). We did not specifically look at the frequency of deep venous thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Femoral venous catheterization offers an alternative site of insertion to the subclavian and jugular veins for central venous access in the critically ill. The occurrence rate of clinically important complications is acceptably low. \nPrevalences of endoscopic and histological findings in subjects with and without dyspepsia OBJECTIVE--To examine the association between dyspeptic symptoms and endoscopic and histological diagnoses. DESIGN--Cross sectional study of people with dyspepsia and controls matched for age and sex identified by questionnaire survey of all inhabitants aged 20 to 69. Endoscopy and histological examination was performed with the examiner blind to whether or not the patient had dyspepsia. SETTING--Population based survey in Sorreisa, Norway. SUBJECTS--All people with dyspepsia and age and sex matched people without dyspepsia were offered endoscopy. A total of 309 people with dyspepsia and 310 without dyspepsia underwent endoscopy, giving 273 matched pairs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalences of endoscopic and histological diagnoses made according to internationally accepted standards. RESULTS--In all, 1802 of 2027 (88.9%) people returned the questionnaire. Of the 163 subjects who refused endoscopy, 114 were controls. Of five endoscopic and four histological diagnoses only peptic ulcer disease, endoscopic duodenitis, and active chronic gastritis were diagnosed significantly more often in people with dyspepsia. In all, 30% to 50% of the diagnoses of mucosal inflammation and peptic ulcer disease were made among subjects without dyspepsia, and only 10% of both those with and those without dyspepsia had normal endoscopic findings. CONCLUSIONS--The diagnostic findings, with possible exceptions of peptic ulcer disease and endoscopic duodenitis, showed no association of clinical value with dyspeptic symptoms. The small number of \"normal\" endoscopic findings in both those with and those without dyspepsia challenge well accepted endoscopic and histological diagnostic criteria with relation to the upper gastrointestinal tract. \nOutpatient liver biopsy: one man's experience. As an academically based gastroenterologist, I performed 94 outpatient liver biopsies over a 42-month period, using the standard suction technique. Differential blood count and vital signs were monitored, with no statistically significant postbiopsy changes noted in the group at large. One patient required admission to the hospital for bleeding, and six patients required intramuscular analgesics for pain at the biopsy site. Four patients had bradycardia, and one of them required atropine for bradycardia and hypotension. Outpatient liver biopsy is a safe procedure with low morbidity and complication rate. It would appear that prolonged monitoring is not necessary. \nVagally mediated acid hypersecretion and lesion formation in anesthetized rat under hypothermic conditions. The pathophysiological changes associated with hypothermia were investigated in the rat stomach under anesthetized conditions. The animal was placed in a styrene foam box and the core body temperature was kept between 24 and 36 degrees C using a heat lamp and refrigerant pack. Lowering of body temperature (less than 30 degrees C) produced acid hypersecretion and induced hemorrhagic lesions in the gastric mucosa; these responses reached the maximum at 28 degrees C, and a significant relationship was found between acid output and lesion score. Hypothermia (28 degrees C) also caused a marked increase of gastric contractile activity and mucosal blood flow (MBF), but the ratio of acid output to MBF became greater when compared to that obtained under normothermic conditions. These changes induced by hypothermia (28 degrees C) were completely blocked by vagotomy and were significantly inhibited by atropine, hexamethonium, clonidine, or TRH antiserum. However, lowering body temperature did not significantly affect acid secretory, motility, and ulcerogenic responses induced by carbachol in the vagotomized rat, excluding local mechanisms (suppression of the inhibitory nerves) in the hypothermia-induced changes. We conclude that hypothermia alone stimulates vagally dependent acid secretion and motility, resulting in damage in the gastric mucosa. These changes may be centrally mediated by TRH, which is released in association with the thermogenic response to hypothermia. \nNonneoplastic enhancing lesions mimicking intracanalicular acoustic neuroma on gadolinium-enhanced MR images. The authors describe five patients with nonneoplastic lesions of the facial and/or vestibulocochlear nerves that demonstrated focal enhancement within the internal auditory canal on magnetic resonance (MR) images. MR and surgical findings for four patients with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and one with Ramsay Hunt syndrome were reviewed. Three patients with hearing loss underwent surgical exploration and decompression of the internal auditory canal. The MR findings in all four patients with hearing loss were similar: Focal enhancement of the internal auditory canal was depicted on postcontrast T1-weighted images. Nonneoplastic lesions of the seventh and eighth cranial nerves may show focal enhancement on MR images, which mimics the appearance of a small intracanalicular neuroma. This potential for misdiagnosis may have important therapeutic implications. \nSupratentorial dermoid cysts. Supratentorial dermoid cysts are rare lesions. In eight cases presented here, the lack of recurrence after subtotal removal of the capsule and the good long-term prognosis are emphasized. This finding is in agreement with the literature. The frequent relationship of these lesions with the cavernous sinus suggests a vascular genesis in the development of intracranial dermoid cysts. \nPlasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide in spontaneous atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardias of childhood. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was measured in 13 children between the ages of 1 week and 2 years 9 months during atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia and 15 minutes after the restoration of sinus rhythm. There was a significant decline in atrial natriuretic peptide during sinus rhythm. Plasma concentrations of the peptide were significantly higher during tachycardia in seven infants under 1 year than in the six older children. The heart rates and the duration of tachycardia were not significantly different in the two age groups. Cardiac failure was present in five of seven children under 18 weeks of age during tachycardia but in none of the older children. The plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide did not significantly correlate with duration of tachycardia or heart rate. If tachycardia occurs in young infants the low functional reserve capacity of the developing heart leads to cardiac failure more frequently and it is likely that this was the cause of the significantly higher plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide in the younger children. \nSexual transmission of hepatitis C virus and its relation with hepatitis B virus and HIV OBJECTIVE--To determine the extent of transmission of hepatitis C virus in sexual partners of intravenous drug misusers and to examine the relation between the prevalences of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections in homosexual men and intravenous drug misusers and their sexual partners. DESIGN--Serum samples collected between 1984 and 1988 were tested for hepatitis B virus markers and antibodies against hepatitis C virus by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for HIV antibody by enzyme immune analysis and western blotting. SETTING--Large referral university hospital with an external AIDS clinic in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain. SUBJECTS--243 Intravenous drug misusers, 143 of their regular heterosexual partners, and 105 homosexual men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalences of hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV infections. RESULTS--In all, 178 of the 243 (73%) intravenous drug misusers, 16 out of 143 (11%) of their partners, and 17 of the 105 (16%) homosexual men had antibodies against hepatitis C virus. The presence of hepatitis C virus infection was unrelated to sex, age, the presence of HIV or hepatitis B virus infections, or the Centers for Disease Control stage of HIV. In sexual partners of intravenous drug misusers there were strong correlations between the presence of hepatitis C virus infection and that of HIV (p = 0.001) and hepatitis B virus (p = 0.013) infections. CONCLUSIONS--Intravenous drug misusers have a high risk of acquiring hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV infections, but the presence of hepatitis C virus infection seems to be unrelated to the presence of the other two viruses. Homosexual men have a high prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B virus infections with a low prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection, the presence of which is not related to that of the other two infections. Conversely, heterosexual partners of intravenous drug misusers have low prevalences of the three virus infections, but the presence of hepatitis C virus infection correlates significantly with the presence of HIV and hepatitis B infections. The rate of sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus seems to be low, even in partners of people known to be seropositive for this virus. \nTraumatic asphyxia and blunt cardiac injury: case report and selected review. An unusual case is described featuring traumatic asphyxia and blunt cardiac injury. An association between these is possible but not previously described. Coronary artery contusion, malignant arrhythmias, and a normal electrocardiogram were also noted and discussed. The relevant literature was reviewed. \nTransesophageal color Doppler echocardiography of the normal St. Jude Medical mitral valve prosthesis. Transesophageal color flow Doppler findings are reported in 36 patients with a St. Jude Medical mechanical mitral valve prosthesis who had no auscultatory evidence for prosthetic valve dysfunction. Multiple jets consistent with mitral regurgitation originating from the central and lateral portion of the prosthesis were found in all patients. Maximum jet length ranged from 11 to 51 mm (mean 21 +/- 9 mm). Maximum jet area ranged from 0.2 to 4.1 cm3 (mean 1.2 +/- 0.9 cm2). The color M-mode Doppler interrogation showed two distinct components of the regurgitant jet: brief early systolic flow consistent with valve closure followed by holosystolic regurgitant flow consistent with transvalvular leakage. Four patients (11%) had a maximum regurgitant jet length exceeding 30 mm and absence of early systolic closure regurgitant flow by M-mode color imaging, suggesting clinically silent paravalvular leakage. Two pin-sized paravalvular suture line defects were confirmed in one patient at cardiac transplantation. We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography is a highly sensitive method for detection of mitral regurgitation in the St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis. Clinically silent paravalvular leakage should be suspected if the maximum jet length exceeds 30 mm and color M-mode interrogation fails to demonstrate an early systolic closure regurgitant flow component. \nTotal hip replacement for juvenile chronic arthritis. We review the results of 96 primary total hip replacements in 54 patients with juvenile chronic arthritis at five years or longer after surgery. The mean age at operation was 16.7 years (range 11.25 to 26.6); the follow-up period averaged 11.5 years. The clinical results in terms of pain, range of movement, mobility and function are presented. A revision procedure was required in 24 hips (25%) in 18 patients at an average of 9.5 years after the primary operation. A further 17 hips had radiographic signs of loosening. The factors thought to contribute to this relatively high failure rate in patients with juvenile chronic arthritis are discussed. \nHistory of epilepsy in Chinese traditional medicine. The first known document on epilepsy in China appeared in The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, Huang Di Nei Ching, written by a group of physicians around 770-221 B.C. The description of epilepsy in this book and in many others later published was confined to generalized convulsive seizures. No documentation of absence or simple partial seizures was provided. The first classification of epilepsy, probably by Cao Yuan Fang in A.D. 610, listed five types of epilepsy: \"Yang Dian,\" \"Yin Dian,\" \"Feng (Wind) Dian,\" \"Shih (Wet) Dian,\" and \"Lao (Labor) Dian.\" Later, other classifications named seizures after the cry of animals whose cry the \"epileptic cry\" resembled, or after \"visceral organs\" believed to be responsible for the seizures. The concept of partial versus generalized seizures, however, was not observed in any of these classifications. The treatment of epilepsy, based on principles of \"Yin Yang Wu Xing,\" consisted of herbs, acupuncture, and massage. \nA phase I trial of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta alone and in combination with myelosuppressive doses of 5-fluorouracil in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. We studied escalating doses of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) alone and after a myelosuppressive dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Transient neutropenia, monocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia were observed followed by a 1.3- to 6.0-fold (mean, 3.46-fold) dose-dependent neutrophil leukocytosis (P less than .00001) on the days of IL-1 beta administration. Increases in platelet counts were observed at a median of 14 days (range, 6 to 23) after IL-1 beta administration. Transient hypoglycemia, rebound hyperglycemia, elevations in serum cortisol, and C-reactive protein were observed. Side effects included fever, rigors, and headache in the majority of patients. Hypotension was observed in three of five patients at the highest dose level (0.1 micrograms/kg) and was dose-limiting. Fewer days of neutropenia were noted after 5-FU plus IL-1 beta than after 5-FU alone; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. These data show that IL-1 beta has stimulatory effects in human hematopoiesis. \nLewis blood group antigens (a and b) in human breast tissues. Loss of Lewis-b in breast cancer cells and correlation with tumor grade. The Lewis blood group antigens (Lewis-a [Lea] and Lewis-b [Leb]) and their precursors are present on various normal human epithelial cell surfaces. The authors examined 35 benign and malignant human breast lesions using mouse monoclonal antibodies to synthetic Lea and Leb carbohydrate antigens. Normal breast lobular and ductal epithelium and benign breast lesions showed Leb staining but only occasional Lea staining. In invasive ductal carcinomas of breast, of all grades, a loss of Leb antigen staining was found in 80% of the breast cancer cases. This reduced Leb antigen expression increased with the grade of malignancy. Therefore, the loss of Leb blood group antigens on breast cancer cell surfaces may suggest altered fucosylation patterns in malignant cells and reflect the degree of malignancy and/or invasiveness. \nInfarction in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. A case report. An unusual case of focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver with infarction is presented. The patient, a 16-year-old girl with a three-year history of oral contraceptive use, presented with a two-week history of intermittent abdominal pain. Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver and the role of estrogens in the development of this lesion are discussed. \nAutofluorescence of normal and malignant bronchial tissue. In vivo autofluorescence spectra were obtained in 5 patients with carcinoma in situ, 26 patients with invasive tumors, and 1 patient with severe dysplasia. Significant spectral differences were observed between pre-cancerous, cancerous, and normal bronchial tissues. This difference may afford a method to image and/or detect early lung cancer by using tissue autofluorescence alone. \nMapping of human microtubule-associated protein 1B in proximity to the spinal muscular atrophy locus at 5q13. A polyclonal antiserum directed against the C-terminal domain of dystrophin was used to isolate a cDNA clone encoding an antigenically cross-reactive protein, microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP-1B). Physical mapping of the human MAP-1B locus places its chromosomal location at 5q13, in proximity to the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) locus. SMA is a degenerative disorder primarily affecting motor neurons. Genetic linkage analysis of SMA families using a human dinucleotide repeat polymorphism just 3' of the MAP-1B gene has shown tight linkage to SMA mutations. These mapping data together with the postulated role of MAP-1B in neuronal morphogenesis and its localization in anterior horn motor neurons suggest a possible association with SMA. \nCurrent approaches to chronic pain in older patients. As the population ages, primary care physicians face an increasing number of individuals who suffer from the effects of chronic diseases, including the accompanying chronic pain. This article reviews the common causes of pain in the elderly and suggests a system for assessing its severity. Five different approaches to treating pain in this population are outlined, as are guidelines for managing the potential side effects of treatment. \nMagnetic resonance imaging and late-onset epilepsy. The value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in investigation of patients with late-onset epilepsy has not been studied systematically. We evaluated prospectively the usefulness of MRI in 50 patients with late-onset epilepsy in whom a computed tomography (CT) scan was normal (32), did not allow a definitive diagnosis to be made (12), or showed irrelevant lesions (6). Patients were assessed clinically and had an EEG, and CT and MRI scans were reported by one neuroradiologist blinded to clinical and laboratory data. Of the 32 patients with a normal CT scan, MRI was normal in 20, showed irrelevant ischemic lesions in 8, and showed the cause of seizures in 4 patients. Of the 12 patients with nondiagnostic CT, MRI clarified the diagnosis in 5 and was normal in 2 patients. In 6 patients, both scans showed irrelevant ischemic lesions, and in 1 patient MRI showed a relevant additional lesion. The incidence of MRI-detected white matter ischemic lesions was no greater than in an age- and sex-matched group of subjects without seizures. MRI was diagnostic in 32% of the patients with partial seizures and/or focal EEG findings, as compared with 0% of patients without focal features (p less than 0.01). We conclude that MRI is useful in investigation of patients with late-onset epilepsy with focal features. \nAcute nonhemodynamic pulmonary edema with nifedipine in primary pulmonary hypertension. A 34-year-old man with primary pulmonary hypertension developed acute nonhemodynamic pulmonary edema after a loading dose of nifedipine. Changes of the vascular permeability induced by the drug acting on the arteriolar wall of the capillary system could be an explanation. \nStaging carcinoma: its value in cancer of the larynx. Three thousand four hundred and forty-five cases of cancer of the larynx were examined and 3,235 assigned to their TNM group. While good correlation with prognosis could be seen, the value of the detailed subsite (as opposed to the main laryngeal regions) was limited to defining T1a and T1b and aiding that of T2. T status gives some indication of prognosis, but the N status is of almost overriding importance. \nControl of blood gas measurements in intensive-care units. The frequency of blood gas measurement in two adult intensive-care units was assessed for 7 months before and 12 months after introduction of a protocol of indications for such investigation. Demographic, diagnostic, outcome, and intervention data were collected prospectively. There were no differences in demographic characteristics, severity or type of illness, survival, or frequency of arterial or pulmonary artery catheter use between the two observation periods, but the frequency of blood gas analysis fell by 44% (p less than 0.001) after the protocol was introduced. \nMyocardial perfusion imaging with technetium-99m-labeled agents. Thallium-201 (201Tl) is suboptimal as a single-photon emitting agent for myocardial perfusion imaging, in view of its low-energy photons and long half-life. To circumvent these limitations, two new myocardial perfusion imaging agents labeled with technetium-99m (99mTc) have been developed. They are Tc-sestamibi and Tc-teboroxime. Clinical trials of myocardial perfusion with both tracers have shown results similar to those obtained with 201Tl for detection of coronary artery disease. Results to date indicate that Tc-sestamibi accurately detects and locates myocardial infarction and can accurately assess both left and right ventricular ejection fractions by the first-pass technique. In addition, research has shown that rest-stress studies can be performed on the same day and that Tc-sestamibi can be used to assess the results of thrombolytic therapy. Tc-teboroxime has excellent myocardial tracer uptake characteristics but is cleared very rapidly from the myocardium. These features make Tc-teboroxime well suited to rapid serial studies. These new technetium myocardial perfusion agents have just become available for routine clinical use and are likely to replace 201Tl in many of its clinical applications. \nNovel approach to iatrogenic bile peritonitis. Bile peritonitis after injury to the biliary tree is a serious complication that requires exploratory laparotomy. Our patient had an obstructing ampullary carcinoma, and generalized bile peritonitis developed from attempted percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. The patient's condition was managed by peritoneal lavage and endoscopic transampullary stenting, with immediate relief of pain and toxicity. Exploratory laparotomy was avoided, and an eventual pylorus-sparing Whipple resection was the definitive treatment. We believe this to be the first report of successful nonoperative treatment of a patient with bile peritonitis with obstructive jaundice. \nHepatic lesions in alcoholic HBV carriers. Liver biopsies were taken from 54 alcoholic HBV carriers with liver dysfunction to assess whether HBV infection or habitual drinking was the main cause of their illness. In 28 cases, ultrastructural studies were done. Results showed that 50% of the cases predominantly displayed virus-related histological changes, whereas 13% of them mainly had alcohol-related ones. Both pathological changes were evenly distributed in four cases. The remaining 15 cases showed nonspecific or other histological changes. Electron microscopy revealed that HBV core and Dane particles were seen with Mallory bodies in the same hepatocytes. Thus, we postulate that HBV-related changes are more often encountered than alcoholic ones in alcoholic HBV carriers and that HBV replication can occur even in hepatocytes bearing Mallory bodies. \nElevated intravesical pressure causes arterial hypoperfusion in canine colocystoplasty: a fluorometric assessment. Since 1988 there have been 15 reported cases of late, spontaneously ruptured intestinal cystoplasties at bowel sites remote from the anastomosis. Ischemic necrosis has been suggested as a possible etiology. We examined this hypothesis by quantifying the uptake of intravascular fluorescein in the augmented bowel of adult mongrel canines. There was a statistically significant decrease in fluorescein uptake at high intravesical pressures, which appeared to be most pronounced at the antimesenteric border. This laboratory study supports a recent clinical report of histological changes pathognomonic for chronic ischemia in the augmented bowel of patients with spontaneous rupture. \nEndorectal sonography in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. Endorectal sonography initially was developed for evaluation of the prostate and now has been adapted for evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. We used endorectal sonography to evaluate a spectrum of diseases, including primary and recurrent rectal carcinoma, metastases, villous adenoma, leiomyosarcoma, endometriosis, sacrococcygeal teratoma, chordoma, retroperitoneal cystic hamartoma, pelvic lipomatosis, diverticulitis, and perirectal abscess. The technique has been useful in localization of perirectal abscesses and in sonographically guided biopsy of perirectal masses. Knowledge of normal sonographic anatomy of the rectum is essential in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. In this essay, we describe the technique of endorectal sonography and illustrate the sonographic findings in a variety of diseases. \nGeniculate neuralgia: the surgical management of primary otalgia. Intractable, unexplained deep-ear pain presents a rare, albeit significant problem in otolaryngological and neurosurgical practice. The authors review their experience with 18 cases of primary otalgia during the past 15 years. A total of 31 surgical procedures were performed. Seventeen patients had sequential rhizotomies and one patient had microvascular decompression alone. Based on the clinical diagnosis, the nerves sectioned were singly or in combination: the nervus intermedius (14 patients), geniculate ganglion (10 patients), ninth nerve (14 patients), 10th nerve (11 patients), tympanic nerve (four patients), and chorda tympani nerve (one patient). Microvascular decompression of the involved nerves was undertaken in nine patients, in whom vascular loops were discovered. Adhesions (six patients), thickened arachnoid (three patients), and benign osteoma (one patient) were other intraoperative abnormalities noted. The overall success of these procedures in providing pain relief was 72.2%, and the mean follow-up period was 3.3 years (range 1 month to 14.5 years). There was no surgical mortality. Expected side effects were: decreased lacrimation, salivation, and taste related to nervus intermedius nerve section, and transient hoarseness and diminished gag related to ninth and 10th nerve section. Four patients developed sequelae consisting of sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, and transient facial nerve paresis. One patient had a cerebrospinal fluid leak and another developed aseptic meningitis as postoperative complications. Except when primary glossopharyngeal neuralgia is the working diagnosis, a combined posterior cranial fossa-middle cranial fossa approach is recommended for adequate exploration and/or section of the fifth, ninth, and 10th cranial nerves as well as the geniculate ganglion and nervus intermedius. \nClinical utility of transesophageal echocardiography. Routine transthoracic echocardiography fails to generate images of diagnostic quality in a significant number of patients who are obese, uncooperative, or unable to be properly positioned (eg, patients receiving ventilatory assistance), and in those with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chest wall deformities, or recent thoracic surgical procedures. In addition, posterior structures in the heart such as the left atrium, left atrial appendage, atrial septum, and mitral valve are seen with poorer resolution than structures closer to the anterior chest wall. Placement of a sonographic transducer in the esophagus immediately behind the heart circumvents these limitations. Newly developed probes are well tolerated by sedated conscious patients as well as by patients receiving ventilatory assistance in the intensive care unit and those under general anesthesia. Consequently, transesophageal echocardiography is now available for further enhancement of cardiac diagnosis in outpatients, for evaluating the hemodynamic status of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, for intraoperative assessment of cardiac repairs, and for intraoperative cardiac monitoring in noncardiac surgical procedures. A series of case examples from our practice during a recent 1-year period illustrates the clinical utility of this technique in these settings. \nA pseudoaneurysm of the superficial femoral artery as a late complication of a stab wound. Limited arteriography based on clinical indications has become increasingly popular. We present the case of a patient with pseudoaneurysm formation of the superficial femoral artery as a late consequence of a lateral stab wound to the thigh. This case demonstrates the need for postinjury follow-up to identify missed injuries before they are limb threatening. \nReduction to homozygosity involving p53 in esophageal cancers demonstrated by the polymerase chain reaction. Loss of heterozygosity affecting chromosome 17p has been detected at high frequencies in a variety of human tumors, including cancers of the colon, breast, lung, and brain. One presumed target of these losses is p53, a tumor suppressor gene located on 17p. To our knowledge, loss of heterozygosity has not yet been reported at any locus, including p53, in human esophageal cancer. Moreover, current methods of detecting loss of heterozygosity depend on the availability of large amounts of high molecular weight DNA, making the study of small biopsy specimens or paraffin-embedded tissues problematic. We examined 52 primary human esophageal neoplasms for loss of heterozygosity affecting the p53 gene by using the polymerase chain reaction. Loss of one allele was detected in 52% of informative cases and was more common in squamous carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas. Southern blot analysis was used to confirm polymerase chain reaction-derived data. The identification of allelic loss in approximately half of the tumors analyzed supports the hypothesis that inactivation of p53 is involved in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer. \nPhotodynamic therapy for multiple primary bronchogenic carcinoma. In recent years, multiple primary lung cancers have been reported with greater frequency, partly as a result of technologic advances in the detection of lung cancer and therapeutic achievements in its management. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively new therapy used with increasing frequency in the treatment of a wide variety of malignancies, including central lung cancers. In PDT, the differential retention of an injected photosensitizer by malignant tissue is exploited by treatment with a low-power laser beam delivered endoscopically. Since 1980, 145 patients with central lung cancers, including 35 cases of endoscopically evaluated early-stage lesions were treated with PDT at Tokyo Medical College. Thirteen of these 145 patients had multiple primary bronchogenic carcinomas, five cases of which were synchronous with the rest, metachronous. Three of 13 patients with multiple tumors had early-stage lesions and were treated with endoscopic PDT alone. In the other ten cases, PDT was used to treat accessible early-stage foci although operative excision was required for advanced lesions. Mean survival after PDT, alone or in combination with surgery, was 38 months (range, 14 to 87 months), and seven patients remain alive to date. It was concluded that PDT is useful in extending the therapeutic options for, and improving the prognosis of patients with, multiple primary bronchogenic carcinomas. \nElectrothrombosis of saccular aneurysms via endovascular approach. Part 1: Electrochemical basis, technique, and experimental results. Eleven experimental saccular aneurysms were created on the common carotid artery of swine. Between 3 and 15 days after creation of these aneurysms, they were thrombosed via an endovascular approach, using a very soft detachable platinum coil delivered through a microcatheter positioned within the aneurysm. This detachable platinum coil was soldered to a stainless steel delivery guidewire. Intra-aneurysmal thrombosis was then initiated by applying a low positive direct electric current to the delivery guidewire. Thrombosis occurred because of the attraction of negatively charged white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, and fibrinogen to the positively charged platinum coil positioned within the aneurysm. The passage of electric current detached the platinum coil within the clotted aneurysm in 4 to 12 minutes. This detachment was elicited by electrolysis of the stainless steel wire nearest to the thrombus-covered platinum coil. Control angiograms obtained 2 to 6 months postembolization confirmed permanent aneurysm occlusion as well as patency of the parent artery in all cases. No angiographic manifestation of untoward distal embolization was noted. Due to the encouraging results of this research, this technique has been applied in selected clinical cases which are described in Part 2 of this study. \nNon-Q- and Q-wave infarction after thrombolytic therapy with intravenous streptokinase for chest pain and anterior ST-segment elevation The clinical features of patients treated with streptokinase for chest pain and anterior ST-segment elevation who subsequently develop non-Q-wave infarction are unknown. Of the 75 consecutive patients who initially presented with chest pain and ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V6, I, aVL) and were treated with intravenous streptokinase (time from symptoms to treatment averaged less than 3 hours), 32 (43%) developed a non-Q-wave and 43 (57%) a Q-wave myocardial infarction. Twenty seven of 32 patients (84%) from the non-Q-wave group and 39 of 43 (91%) from the Q-wave group were studied by angiography at 5.16 +/- 2.88 days after the onset of myocardial infarction. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 13 +/- 6 vs 20 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction was 60 +/- 8 vs 49 +/- 14% (p less than 0.001) and the infarct vessel patency rate was 85 vs 72% (p = 0.44) in patients with a non-Q versus a Q-wave infarction, respectively. In summary, when patients presenting with chest pain and ST-segment elevation are treated with streptokinase, a significant portion of these symptoms will evolve into ",
