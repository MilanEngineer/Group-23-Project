        "text": "t are present in early Parkinson's disease. It appears that tests of bradykinesia are most sensitive, and detection of rest tremor is most specific. These tests may be applicable in screening individuals who are suspected of having or are \"at risk for\" Parkinson's disease and other related disorders. \nNatural history and prognostic variables in primary sclerosing cholangitis. The clinical features at the time of presentation and the outcome in 126 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were studied to clarify the natural history and prognosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The median age of the patients at the time of presentation was 36 years, 62% were male, and 16% were asymptomatic. The median follow-up from time of presentation was 5.8 years. There were more patients who had liver transplants (21%) than patients who died of liver-related disease (16%); the estimated median survival to these end points was 12 years. Cholangiocarcinoma was found in 8 patients and in 23% of those undergoing liver transplantation. Asymptomatic patients had milder disease than symptomatic patients, but in a univariate analysis the presence of symptoms was not prognostically significant. On multivariate analysis, the following independent prognostic factors were found: hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, serum alkaline phosphatase, histological stage, and age. These features were combined to produce a prognostic model that should be valuable in the stratification of patients in clinical trials and in the timing of liver transplantation, particularly in those patients seen soon after presentation. \nPsychological aspects of orthognathic surgery: how people respond to facial change. This study was undertaken to explore the motivations and problems shared by adult orthognathic surgical patients over the age of 25. Objective findings included demographic information and reasons for seeking surgery. The majority of 65 respondents cited functional problems as their primary reason for seeking treatment. Eighty-nine percent were pleased with esthetic changes, and 83% responded that the functional problem had been corrected. For most, the greatest discomfort related to the surgery was the postoperative intensive care unit. Two of the most common side effects of the surgery were the loss of sensation in the lips and chin area and a short period of depression. Women had depression more often than men but were more enthusiastic about the final results of the procedure. Two major areas of interest to surgeons emerged from the research. First, although women have functional problems, the majority seem to have a desire for cosmetic improvement. Having a functional problem seemed to provide the psychological permission necessary to spend the time and money for a cosmetic change. The second point focused on the need for good communication between surgeon and patient. The patients who were more positive toward the procedure and more satisfied with the results were those who were better informed and who thought they had a good system of communication with the orthodontist, surgeon, and their respective staffs. \nSecondary ischaemia in rabbit skin flaps: the roles played by thromboxane and free radicals. 1. Biochemical mechanisms of ischaemia were investigated in rabbit skin flaps subjected to 2 h of primary ischaemia then, 24 h later, to 4 h of secondary ischaemia. During secondary ischaemia, flaps underwent either total ischaemia (arterial and venous blood supply occluded) or partial ischaemia (vein only occluded). Some of these flaps were treated at the time of reperfusion with the free-radical scavenger superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) and/or the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor UK-38,485. 2. After 30 min of reperfusion, superoxide dismutase treatment significantly reduced blood thromboxane levels, elevated during ischaemia. Superoxide dismutase also reduced tissue levels of malonyldialdehyde and xanthine oxidase, indicators of free-radical damage, and restored the depleted tissue levels of superoxide dismutase. 3. UK-38,485 treatment failed to significantly alter any of these tissue free-radical parameters, although this agent significantly reduced blood thromboxane levels. 4. Combined superoxide dismutase plus UK-38,485 treatment was not significantly better than either treatment alone with respect to any parameter. 5. Partial ischaemia led to consistently higher levels of tissue free radicals and blood thromboxane than did total ischaemia. Thus partial ischaemia appears to result in greater free-radical damage than total ischaemia. 6. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that thromboxane acts as a mediator for free-radical damage in the ischaemic changes within the flap. \nExperimental arterial thrombosis in nonhuman primates. The baboon offers many advantages as an experimental animal to study vascular disease, thrombus formation and dissolution, effects of mediating variables, and the relative efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Each specific application for testing therapeutic agents may require testing in somewhat different model systems. For example, although the arteriovenous vascular graft model is efficient, cost effective, and well adapted to study of interventions for acute arterial thrombosis, surgical endarterectomy extends the evaluation to include interactions with the injured vascular wall. As the antithrombotic products of genetic engineering and molecular biology emerge, it will be increasingly important to have relevant, reproducible, and quantitative approaches to evaluate their effects in vivo. \nLow-grade, latent prostate cancer volume: predictor of clinical cancer incidence? We hypothesize that each cell in low-grade (Gleason grade 1-3) prostate cancer tissue is at risk of transformation into a cell which produces a high-grade (Gleason grade 4-5) clinical cancer after a short period of growth. As a consequence, the volume of low-grade, latent cancer tissue in the prostate glands of men at any age determines their incidence rate for high-grade, clinical cancer a few years later. Autopsy and incidence data for both white men and black men support this conclusion, with a tumor growth period of about 7 years. The transformation rate is similar for black men and for white men, about 0.024 high-grade cancers per year per cm3 of low-grade, latent cancer volume. Our hypothesis explains the infrequent occurrence of clinical cancer despite the high prevalence of latent cancer, the steep rise of clinical cancer incidence with age despite the slow rise of latent cancer prevalence with age, and the disparities in clinical cancer incidence among some populations despite their similar latent cancer prevalence. This hypothesis suggests that low-grade cancer volume is a critical determinant of clinical cancer risk. \nThe antifibrillatory actions of UK-68,798, a class III antiarrhythmic agent. The electrophysiologic and antifibrillatory properties of UK-68,798 were studied in vivo in a conscious canine model of sudden coronary death. Electrophysiologic testing was performed on conscious male mongrel dogs (14.5-21.5 kg) 3 to 5 days after surgical induction of an anterior myocardial infarction by occlusion (2 h)-reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Compared to saline-treated control animals, UK-68,798 at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg i.v. did not (P = .083) suppress the induction of ventricular tachycardia by programmed electrical stimulation. Six of 12 UK-68,798-treated dogs remained inducible, whereas 10 of 12 vehicle-treated dogs responded to electrical induction of arrhythmia. When compared to predrug inducibility, UK-68,798 significantly (P = .007) reduced the incidence of programmed electrical stimulation-induced ventricular tachycardia. In five of the six dogs inducible after UK-68,798 administration, the cycle length of the induced ventricular tachycardia was prolonged (P = .007) compared to the predrug cycle length. Heart rate, PR interval and QRS duration were not affected by UK-68,798 administration. The rate-corrected QT interval was prolonged (P less than .05) by UK-68,798. The ventricular effective refractory period was increased by UK-68,798 (158 +/- 7 msec, predrug vs. 185 +/- 7 msec, postdrug). Subsequent to programmed electrical stimulation, a 150 microA anodal current was applied to the luminal surface of the left circumflex coronary artery to induce transient episodes of posterolateral ischemia in response to electrolytic injury of the vessel wall. \nUse of leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score in differentiating malignant from benign paraproteinaemias. The leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score of peripheral blood neutrophils was examined in 20 patients with multiple myeloma and compared with the score in 18 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The mean (95% confidence limit) LAP score in those with multiple myeloma was 186 (169-218) compared with 92 (64-120) in the MGUS group. In the multiple myeloma group all but one patient had a high LAP score, irrespective of disease. No cause for raised LAP, such as infection, was present in any of the patients with multiple myeloma. In the MGUS group six patients had a raised LAP score; in two of them another cause for such a rise was present (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and primary thrombocythaemia). In neither group did the LAP score correlate with duration of the disease, bone marrow plasma cell count, paraprotein concentration, haemoglobin, total white cell or neutrophil count. It is concluded that a normal LAP count in patients with paraproteinaemia suggests a benign condition, but a raised count does not indicate a malignant condition. \nATP-dependent K+ channels modulate vasoconstrictor responses to severe hypoxia in isolated ferret lungs. In normo- and hypoglycemic ferret lungs, the pulmonary vascular response to severe hypoxia (PiO2 less than or equal to 10 mmHg) is characterized by an initial intense vasoconstriction followed by marked vasodilation, whereas in hyperglycemic lungs, vasodilation is minimal, causing vasoconstriction to be sustained. In contrast, the response to moderate hypoxia is characterized by a slowly developing sustained vasoconstriction which is unaffected by glucose concentration. To determine the role of ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channels in these responses, we examined the effects of cromakalim, which opens KATP channels, and glibenclamide, which closes them. During steady-state vasoconstriction induced in isolated ferret lungs by moderate hypoxia, cromakalim caused dose-dependent vasodilation (EC50 = 7 x 10(-7) M) which was reversed by glibenclamide (IC50 = 8 x 10(-7) M), indicating that KATP channels were present and capable of modulating vascular tone. During severe hypoxia in hypoglycemic lungs [( glucose] less than 1 mM), glibenclamide markedly inhibited the secondary vasodilation. Raising perfusate glucose concentration to 14 +/- 0.4 mM had the same effect. As a result, initial vasoconstrictor responses were well sustained. However, neither glibenclamide nor hyperglycemia affected vasoconstrictor responses to moderate hypoxia or KCl, indicating that effects during severe hypoxia were not due to nonspecific potentiation of vasoconstriction. These findings suggest that in the ferret lung (a) severe hypoxia decreased ATP concentration and thereby opened KATP channels, resulting in increased K+ efflux, hyperpolarization, vasodilation, and reversal of the initial vasoconstrictor response; and (b) hyperglycemia prevented this sequence of events. \nColonoscopic surveillance after polypectomy: considerations of cost effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the current recommendation that persons who have had an adenomatous colon polyp removed have periodic colonoscopic surveillance at fixed and regular intervals. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using data from the medical literature in a simulation model to estimate the costs of and the risk for perforation associated with periodic colonoscopic surveillance for a 50-year-old man followed for 30 years. MAIN RESULTS: A program of colonoscopy every 3 years would incur cumulatively a 1.4% risk for colon perforation, a 0.11% risk for perforation-related death, and direct physician costs of $2071 for colonoscopy (discounted at 5%). If a 50-year-old man's cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer is 2.5% after the removal of a single small adenoma and if effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance every 3 years is 100%, then one death from cancer could be prevented by doing 283 colonoscopies, incurring 0.6 perforations, 0.04 perforation-related deaths, and direct physician costs of $82,000. If surveillance were 50% effective and the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer were 1.25%--a plausible scenario--1131 colonoscopies would be required to prevent one death from cancer, incurring 2.3 perforations, 0.17 perforation-related deaths, and physician costs of $331,000. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance is very sensitive to estimates of the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer after polypectomy as well as to surveillance efficacy. For persons whose remaining risk for death from cancer may be low, such as persons with a single small adenoma, recommendations for colonoscopic surveillance at fixed and regular intervals may be excessively costly. \nScreening blood donors for gastrointestinal illness: a strategy to eliminate carriers of Yersinia enterocolitica. Recent reports of fatal transfusion-associated Yersinia enterocolitica sepsis prompted a study of the feasibility of adding a question to the routine donor health history as a method of reducing this risk. In three American Red Cross blood centers, 11,323 donors were asked one of two questions about gastrointestinal symptoms during their health history screenings. Affirmative responses were obtained from 0.6 or 4.0 percent of the donors, depending on how the question was asked. In one center, more than 6 percent of donors gave affirmative answers. The efficacy of asking a relatively simple question about gastrointestinal symptoms as a way of preventing Y. enterocolitica should be evaluated further, because relatively large numbers of donors may respond affirmatively. Other methods of reducing the risk of transfusion-associated Y. enterocolitica infection should be pursued. \nSingle-center comparison of results of 1000 prenatal diagnoses with chorionic villus sampling and 1000 diagnoses with amniocentesis. Large multicenter studies have confirmed the safety and accuracy of chorionic villus sampling as a prenatal genetic diagnostic procedure, but there have been few single-center evaluations. We report our experience with 1000 consecutive chorionic villus sampling procedures compared with 1000 consecutive amniocentesis procedures during the same period. The procedures were performed by the same genetic counselors, sonographers, obstetricians, and laboratory personnel. Indications for referral, demographic characteristics of patients, numbers of attempts per patient, fetal loss rates, laboratory results, and evaluation of accuracy are included. Analysis of all data suggests that chorionic villus sampling is a safe and accurate alternative to amniocentesis in our community-based teaching hospital. \nImmunocytochemical panel for the identification of malignant cells in serous effusions. The cytologic diagnosis of malignancy in serous effusions can be challenging. An immunocytochemical (ICC) panel using commercially available antibodies (to carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], epithelial membrane antigen [EMA], B72.3, Leu-M1, cytokeratin [CK], leukocyte common antigen [LCA], S-100 protein, and vimentin) was applied to cell blocks fixed in methyl Carnoy's solution that were from 55 consecutive pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial fluid specimens. The results were correlated with data from clinical records and routine cytologic studies. Final cytologic diagnoses included 26 of adenocarcinoma and 1 of mesothelioma. The remaining 28 cases were considered to be benign (reactive) proliferations. EMA, CEA, B72.3, and Leu-M1 were present in 96%, 77%, 58%, and 42% of adenocarcinomas, respectively. These determinants were absent in the mesothelioma and the reactive effusions, although anti-CEA yielded strong background staining of inflammatory cells. The CK markers identified malignant cells in 93% of cases, but consistently stained mesothelial cells as well. Antivimentin strongly labeled mesothelial cells in all cases, with weak to absent staining of malignant cells. In 3 of 26 carcinoma cases (12%), the ICC panel identified malignant cells that were not recognized initially on routine cytologic examination. In 1 of 26 cases (4%), the panel was falsely negative. Use of this approach can improve the diagnostic accuracy of cytologic examination of serous fluids. The ICC panel is especially helpful when atypical mesothelial proliferation is present, or in cases that are clinically suspect for malignancy, but cytologically negative because there are only a few malignant cells, or those that are cytologically bland. \nFailure to awaken after general anaesthesia secondary to paradoxical venous embolus. A patient is presented who failed to regain consciousness after an apparently uneventful nine-hour revision of a total hip replacement. There were no clinically important haemodynamic changes during the operation, and oxygen saturation, capnography and acid base balance were normal throughout. Postop CT of the head showed a large left MCA infarct with midline shift. At autopsy, the patient was found to have a previously unsuspected patent foramen ovale, and a venous embolus in the left internal carotid artery, which probably had originated from the periprostatic venous plexus with a large infarct in the distribution of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The authors conclude that massive paradoxical venous emboli can occur during surgery with minimal haemodynamic changes. \nGastric ulcer healing: a comparison of enprostil versus ranitidine. Enprostil is a synthetic prostaglandin E2 analogue with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. We compared the effects of enprostil and ranitidine on the healing of gastric ulcers and the subsequent relapse rates over 6 months. Patients (N = 156) were recruited for a double-blind study from 12 centers in Europe; 71 were randomly assigned to oral treatment with 35 micrograms enprostil twice daily and 85 to 150 mg ranitidine twice daily for up to 8 weeks. Both groups were of similar demography; their healing rates were also similar. Cumulative intent-to-treat healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 48%, ranitidine 41%: at 6 weeks enprostil 65%, ranitidine 68%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 72%, ranitidine 80%. Of those patients who met all protocol criteria and completed treatment, and were endoscoped at the prescribed times, healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 55%, ranitidine 54%, at 6 weeks enprostil 75%, ranitidine 84%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 80%, ranitidine 90%. Relief of pain was rapid and similar in both groups. The incidence of adverse events was low and similar in the two groups. The treatment-free relapse rate at 6 months was enprostil 64%, ranitidine 49%; the median times to relapse were 169 and 203 days, respectively. Enprostil and ranitidine appear to be equally effective in healing gastric ulcers. \nCoordinate occupancy of AP-1 sites in the vitamin D-responsive and CCAAT box elements by Fos-Jun in the osteocalcin gene: model for phenotype suppression of transcription. Osteocalcin, a bone-specific protein and marker of the mature osteoblast, is expressed only in nonproliferating osteoblasts in a mineralizing extracellular matrix, while type I collagen is expressed in proliferating cells. The nuclear proteins encoded by the c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes are expressed during the proliferation period of osteoblast phenotype development. We present evidence that AP-1 (HeLa cell-activating protein 1) sites residing within two promoter elements of the osteocalcin gene bind the Fos-Jun protein complex: the osteocalcin box (OC box; nucleotides -99 to -76), which contains a CCAAT motif as a central element and influences tissue-specific basal levels of osteocalcin gene transcription, and the vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE; nucleotides -462 to -440), which mediates enhancement of osteocalcin gene transcription. Gel electrophoretic mobility-shift analysis demonstrated high AP-1 binding activity in proliferating osteoblasts and dramatic changes in this activity after the down-regulation of proliferation and the initiation of extracellular-matrix mineralization in primary cultures of normal diploid osteoblasts. Methylation interference analysis established at single nucleotide resolution that purified recombinant Fos and Jun proteins bind in a sequence-specific manner to the AP-1 sites within the VDRE and OC box. Similarly, an AP-1 motif within a putative VDRE of the alkaline phosphatase gene, which is also expressed after the completion of proliferation, binds the Fos-Jun complex. These results support a model in which coordinate occupancy of the AP-1 sites in the VDRE and OC box in proliferating osteoblasts may suppress both basal level and vitamin D-enhanced osteocalcin gene transcription as well as transcription of other genes associated with osteoblast differentiation--a phenomenon we describe as phenotype suppression. This model is further supported by binding of the Fos-Jun complex at an AP-1 site in the type alpha I collagen promoter that is contiguous with, but not overlapping, the VDRE. Such a sequence organization in the collagen VDRE motif is compatible with vitamin D modulation of collagen but not with osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase expression in proliferating osteoblasts. \nPentoxifylline in the treatment of vascular impotence--case reports. Vascular impotence is a common medical problem for which available therapies are limited. Three impotent patients observed in the authors' practice who were receiving pentoxifylline for treatment of claudication of the lower extremities spontaneously reported improved sexual function. A controlled trial of pentoxifylline for vascular impotence may be warranted. \nPolycystic ovary syndrome: abnormalities and management with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs. Ovulation induction with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone achieves high ovulatory and pregnancy rates in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism while limiting the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy. However, this form of therapy is apparently less effective in polycystic ovary syndrome. The administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog for 4 to 8 weeks before the initiation of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction can temporarily correct endocrine abnormalities of polycystic ovary syndrome, such as excessive luteinizing hormone and androgen secretion, and improve ovulatory and pregnancy rates in these patients. For optimal results, this pretreatment should probably be repeated before each pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction cycle. Obesity is associated with a lower success rate, and spontaneous abortion remains a prominent complication in polycystic ovary syndrome even after gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog suppression. With this regimen the risks of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy are virtually abolished. Thus, pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone appears to be highly effective and safe for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome also, provided that this treatment is preceded by pituitary-ovarian suppression with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. \nAntineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated diseases: a pathologist's perspective. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are a useful diagnostic serologic marker for the most common forms of necrotizing vasculitis, provide a means of categorizing vasculitides so that diagnostically useful shared pathologic and clinical characteristics can be recognized, and offer insight into the pathogenesis of previously idiopathic diseases. ANCA-associated vasculitides can be categorized into a number of distinctive clinicopathologic categories, eg, Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, pulmonary renal syndrome, microscopic polyarteritis nodosa, leukocytoclastic angiitis, and necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. At least the latter four syndromes can also be caused by other ANCA-negative immunopathogenic mechanisms, eg, immune complex deposition. Therefore, thorough diagnostic classification requires both an assessment of clinicopathologic category, as well as an assessment of immunopathologic category. Although different ANCA-associated vasculitic syndromes have distinctive clinical and pathologic features, all ANCA-associated vasculitides share a number of common pathologic features, ie, focal distribution, necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration. ANCA assays have very good sensitivity and specificity for ANCA-associated diseases, but the prevalence of these diseases in the patient population being analyzed must be taken into consideration when determining the predictive value of a test result. As with all serologic tests, ANCA results must be integrated with other clinical and pathologic data in order to reach the most accurate diagnostic conclusion. \nChronic xerostomia increases esophageal acid exposure and is associated with esophageal injury. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of chronic xerostomia on parameters of gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis. DESIGN: Observational study of a cohort of male patients with xerostomia and age-matched control subjects. SETTING: Tertiary-care Veterans Affairs Medical Center. SUBJECTS: Sixteen male patients with chronic xerostomia secondary to radiation for head and neck cancers or medications. Nineteen age-matched male control subjects with comparable alcohol and smoking histories. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Esophageal motility was similar in patients with xerostomia and controls. Clearance of acid from the esophagus and 24-hour intraesophageal pH were markedly abnormal in patients with xerostomia. Symptoms and signs of esophagitis were significantly more frequent in subjects with xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic xerostomia may predispose to esophageal injury, at least in part, by decreasing the clearance of acid from the esophagus and altering 24-hour intraesophageal pH. Esophageal injury is a previously unreported complication of long-term salivary deficiency. \nAn immunohistochemical study of sarcomatoid liver carcinomas. Six cases of primary hepatic carcinomas with a significant amount of sarcomatoid elements were examined by using immunohistochemical stainings. Four of the six cases were associated with ordinary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one with cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC), and one with mixed HCC and CCC. Alpha-fetoprotein and alpha-1-antitrypsin were negative in sarcomatoid cells of all cases; vimentin stained positively in sarcomatoid tumor cells in two of the six cases; and cytokeratin (CK8) was detected in five cases. The CK8 was not detected in tumor cells of two cases of hepatic angiosarcoma, two of metastatic leiomyosarcomas, and one of metastatic fibrosarcoma, although vimentin stained positively in all these true sarcomas. It was concluded that sarcomatoid dedifferentiation of liver carcinomas might derive from both HCC and CCC. In addition CK8 might be an excellent marker to make a differential diagnosis of sarcomatoid cancers from true metastatic or primary sarcomas of the liver. \nOutcome after emergency surgery for cancer of the large intestine. The data for 77 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent emergency surgery for acute intestinal obstruction (57 patients) or perforation (20 patients) within 24 h of admission were evaluated. The patients were older and had more advanced disease than patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer. Emergency surgery for carcinoma of the right colon consisted of primary resection in 95 per cent of cases and was followed by a 28 per cent mortality rate. Perforated tumours of the left colon and rectum were managed by primary resection in 82 per cent of cases with a 22 per cent mortality rate. In contrast, obstructing tumours of the left colon and rectum were treated by primary resection in 38 per cent of cases with a 6 per cent mortality rate, and by primary decompression in 62 per cent of cases with a 25 per cent mortality rate. The overall postoperative mortality rate was 23 per cent and increased with advanced tumour disease, perforation and peritonitis. Cardiac decompensation and intraabdominal sepsis were the major causes of death. Although the long-term survival rate following emergency surgery was worse than after elective surgery, improvements in outcome should be achieved by better management of the initial emergency situation. \nPain threshold levels and coping strategies among patients who have chest pain and normal coronary arteries. Patients with noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) tend to show lower pain threshold levels for esophageal balloon distention than do patients with other painful gastrointestinal disorders and healthy controls. The NCCP patients also report greater usage of negative pain-coping strategies, less ability to perform specific behaviors to decrease pain, and higher levels of clinical pain than do other patient and healthy control groups. Behavioral treatments produce significant decreases in pain and disruption of daily activities. Further effort is needed, however, to develop treatments for NCCP that are based on knowledge of the behavioral manifestations of this disorder and the afferent mechanisms involved in perception of visceral pain. \nAcute venous thrombosis. Therapeutic choices for superficial and deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis is common in varicose veins or veins that have undergone trauma from catheters or intravenous medications. Pain and tenderness, warmth, and erythema are diagnostic features. A compression bandage and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent are often all that is required for treatment. Deep vein thrombosis occurs in veins beneath the deep fascia of the leg or in the pelvis or abdomen. It is often asymptomatic but must be treated to prevent pulmonary embolization and postthrombotic syndrome. Standard therapy is administration of heparin sodium for 5 days, followed by tapering and discontinuation. Warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) is sometimes given simultaneously. Longer courses of anti-coagulation therapy are necessary in patients with an ongoing risk of recurrence. \nCost effectiveness of prophylactic intravenous immune globulin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [see comment] BACKGROUND. A recent randomized controlled trial of intravenous immune globulin in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the rate of bacterial infections among patients who received intravenous immune globulin. We used decision-analysis techniques to determine whether prophylactic intravenous immune globulin is likely to result in an overall clinical benefit to patients who receive this treatment and to examine its cost effectiveness. METHODS. We constructed a model to compare two strategies: treatment with intravenous immune globulin at a dose of 400 mg per kilogram of body weight every three weeks and no immune globulin therapy. Baseline estimates of the efficacy of intravenous immune globulin were derived from the published results of the randomized trial. The costs of treatment, complications, and infections were estimated on the basis of component costs. Health outcomes were measured in terms of gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy. RESULTS. Intravenous immune globulin therapy can result in a loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy when the inconvenience of treatment is taken into account. If the inconvenience of treatment is not considered, therapy results in a gain of 0.8 quality-adjusted days per patient per year of therapy at a cost of $6 million per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS. Decision-analysis modeling may be applied to the results of randomized controlled trials to assess the potential clinical and financial effects of adopting the intervention in medical practice. In the case of intravenous immune globulin therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, this type of analysis suggests that treatment might not result in improved quality or length of life and that it is extraordinarily expensive in comparison with other treatments generally accepted as cost effective. \nAbnormal perception of visceral pain in response to gastric distension in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia. The irritable stomach syndrome. Sensory and pressure responses to gastric distension were evaluated in 24 consecutive patients suffering from chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and 20 healthy subjects. A latex balloon was placed in the proximal stomach and inflated by increments of 100 ml of air up to a maximal volume of 800 ml. Symptom response and intragastric pressure-volume curve were recorded during the gradual balloon distension. Thirteen of the 24 patients experienced pain at a distension volume less than or equal to 400 ml of air, but only one of the 20 controls (P less than 0.001). Intragastric pressure-volume curves were similar in patients and controls, and in patients with and without abnormal pain threshold, suggesting that a compliance defect was not the cause of the sensory anomaly. Gastric emptying of solids and liquids was measured in 20 of the 24 patients using a dual isotopic technique; psychological status was also evaluated in 18 patients using the Mini-Mult test. The frequency of the sensory anomaly was not different in patients with (7/14) or without (4/6) gastric stasis, but was lower in patients with (5/13) than in those without psychological disturbances (5/5, P less than 0.01). Thus, a primary visceral sensory anomaly, either alone or in conjunction with motility disturbances, can play an important role in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and must be taken in account for further therapeutic research. \nA study of nonbacterial agents of acute lower respiratory tract infection in Thai children. From January 1986 to December 1987, 596 children less than 5 years of age with lower respiratory tract infection (LRI)--manifested as laryngitis, croup, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia--were studied for evidence of infection with respiratory tract viruses Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Of the 596 children in the study, 315 were ambulatory and 281 were hospitalized. Virologic studies included isolation and rapid diagnosis of virus from specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and serologic studies of blood samples. Cultures of NPA for C. trachomatis were performed for children less than 6 months of age who had pneumonia. Of the LRI cases, 45% were associated with viral infections of the respiratory tract and 12.1% were associated with C. trachomatis. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounted for 45.2% of infections with viral agents and was associated with acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Parainfluenza type 3 virus was the most common virus found in conjunction with laryngitis and croup. The incidence of infections due to RSV peaked in July and August, while that of infections due to parainfluenza viruses peaked in February and March; influenza viruses and adenoviruses were isolated throughout the year. \nFebrile seizure. Caring for patients--and their parents. Management of febrile seizure involves diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause and assessment of risk factors for recurrence. What should physicians tell anxious parents about this frightening occurrence? Is prophylaxis with anticonvulsant agents appropriate? The authors address these questions and discuss the changing approach to management of febrile seizure. \nProspective blinded trial of the colonoscopic miss-rate of large colorectal polyps. We prospectively studied the colonoscopic miss-rate of large colorectal polyps in a blinded trial featuring tandem colonoscopy. Sixty-three lesions greater than or equal to 1 cm in size were discovered and none were missed. Confidence intervals of 95% are a miss-rate of 0 to 4.6%. We conclude that less than 5% of large colorectal polyps are missed during the index colonoscopic examination in a well-prepared colon. \nSymptomatic cerebral swelling complicating diabetic ketoacidosis documented by intraventricular pressure monitoring: survival without neurologic sequela. A six-year-old boy developed symptomatic cerebral swelling four hours after the initiation of treatment for newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus complicated by ketoacidosis. Ventriculostomy documented intracranial pressure over a two-day period. Increased intracranial pressure unresponsive to controlled hyperventilation and sedation was treated by administering a diuretic and by drainage via a ventriculostomy. Intracranial pressure monitoring was a useful adjunct in management of this rare, but often lethal, complication of diabetes mellitus. One year later, both school performance and the results of a neurologic examination were normal. \nPredicting left heart failure after a myocardial infarction: a preliminary study of the value of echocardiographic measures of left ventricular filling and wall motion. Heart failure occurs from both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. To determine whether simple Doppler echocardiographic measures of left ventricular filling could improve upon the ability of systolic function to predict heart failure after infarction, patients with acute myocardial infarction were studied within the first 36 hours by Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography. Forty-eight patients who did not have heart failure before the Doppler echocardiographic study and who did not have myocardial revascularization, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, or other complications during recovery were monitored for 6 months or to the onset of heart failure (n = 10). The univariate predictors of heart failure were age (p less than 0.05), anterior infarction (p less than 0.05), early diastolic peak filling velocity (p = 0.05), filling velocity with atrial systole (p less than 0.05), the ratio of these velocities (p less than 0.001), the percentage of filling with atrial systole (p less than 0.001), and the wall motion score index (p less than 0.001). However, the only independent predictors of heart failure by use of multivariant stepwise logistic regression analysis were the wall motion score index (p less than 0.05) and either the ratio of early and late peak filling velocities (p less than 0.001) or the percentage of filling with atrial systole (p less than 0.001). The combined use of a measure of systolic function and measures of the relative contribution of atrial systole to ventricular filling were useful predictors in identifying patients likely to develop subsequent heart failure after myocardial infarction. \nClinical patterns of paediatric urolithiasis. A series of 270 paediatric stone patients was studied retrospectively according to the clinical pattern of urolithiasis (age and sex, stone location, stone analysis, recurrence rate) and aetiology of stone disease (infection, anatomical, metabolic or idiopathic). Infection stones occurred earliest and more commonly in males and were usually upper tract struvite calculi related to Proteus infection. Anatomical stones were most commonly associated with pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction and had a high recurrence rate, despite surgical correction of obstruction. Idiopathic stones most resembled those found in adult urolithiasis by virtue of occurring latest, being sited in the ureter more often and being more frequently composed of calcium oxalate. Metabolic stones were most frequently calcium phosphate or cystine and virtually all were renal. They comprised the smallest group but had the highest recurrence rate. \nDesflurane is a trigger of malignant hyperthermia in susceptible swine. Desflurane (difluoromethyl 1-fluoro 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl ether: CF2-H-O-CFH-CF3) is a potent inhalation anesthetic agent being investigated for possible clinical use. The authors examined the effects of this agent on normal swine and those from a special breeding program that were considered purebred for susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH). Animals were exposed to 1 or 2 MAC or both doses of desflurane and observed for changes in end-tidal CO2, arterial blood gases, lactate, catecholamines, core temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. All normal swine tolerated exposure to desflurane without clinical signs of MH, but significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure were noted. In contrast, of six MH susceptible swine tested, two had unequivocal MH reactions to deflurane, defined by significant increases of end-tidal CO2 (greater than 50 mmHg), an increase in PaCO2 (greater than 70 mmHg), a decrease in blood pH (less than 7.30), an increase in blood lactate concentration, and an increase in core temperature. Two other susceptible swine showed equivocal signs of MH but not until desflurane had been administered for 40-60 min. Finally, two other susceptible swine showed no signs of MH after 60 min of exposure to 2 MAC desflurane. These latter four animals all developed episodes of MH immediately after intravenous succinylcholine (2 mg/kg). The increased PaCO2, blood lactate concentrations, and temperature, and the decrease in pH induced by desflurane, were successfully treated with dantrolene and supportive measures. All surviving animals were biopsied 1 to 2 weeks after the exposure to desflurane for in vitro contracture testing to confirm MH susceptibility. \nImproved specificity of myocardial thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with left bundle branch block by dipyridamole. Reduced septal uptake of thallium-201 during exercise is frequently observed in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and normal coronary arteries. This may reflect normal coronary autoregulation in response to lower septal oxygen demand; thus, dipyridamole, which uniformly exploits flow reserve, would be more accurate for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Sixteen patients with LBBB underwent exercise and dipyridamole thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography within 3 months. Sensitivity for detection of left anterior descending CAD (greater than 50% stenosis) was 0.83 for exercise and 1.00 for dipyridamole. Specificity was 0.30 (visual) or 0.20 (quantitative analysis) for exercise and 0.80 (visual) or 0.90 (quantitative) for dipyridamole (p less than 0.05). Dipyridamole combined with quantitative analysis also improved specificity of CAD detection overall (p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that pharmacologic vasodilation is more accurate than exercise when diagnosing CAD by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with LBBB. \nDepression and chronic fatigue in the patient with chronic pain. Chronic benign pain is commonly associated with chronic fatigue and depression. Depression and chronic fatigue syndrome are also associated with each other and often include pain. Psychologic factors are prominent in these conditions, and they may share neurobiologic factors as well. Management requires separately addressing each component of patients' distress and usually includes physical rehabilitation, education, administration of nonhabituating medications and often counseling. Depression may be a favorable prognostic sign, as it suggests a treatable condition and provides incentive for recovery. \nPrognostic factors in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. In a retrospective study of 119 patients, followed for 1 to 30 years after treatment of a papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, the authors searched for possible prognostic factors of the risk of recurrence. Microcarcinomas, anaplastic tumors and Hurthle cell carcinomas were excluded from the study. In a univariate analysis, age (greater than 45 years), sex (male), loss of histologic differentiation, size (greater than 3 cm), presence of carcinomatous lymphangitis, extrathyroid extension, and presence of metastasis at diagnosis were associated with a higher recurrence rate; type of growth and multifocality were not significant. In a multivariate analysis (logistic regression), age, size, and carcinomatous lymphangitis were significant predictors for women, whereas metastasis at diagnosis and cystic growth were significant for men. \nLocal thrombin synthesis and fibrin formation in an in vitro thrombosis model result in platelet recruitment and thrombus stabilization on collagen in heparinized blood The role of the local synthesis of thrombin in platelet recruitment and thrombus stabilization in heparinized blood was examined in vitro. Mural thrombosis was visualized and measured in a thin, rectangular, collagen-coated capillary under controlled rheological conditions by using fluorescence digital videomicroscopy and fluorescence microphotometry. Thrombin activity was inhibited in heparinized blood by the synthetic competitive inhibitor, D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl chloromethylketone (FPRCH2Cl), resulting in a marked reduction in the rate of platelet accumulation on collagen surfaces, indicating a role for thrombin in platelet recruitment. Similar although lesser effects were observed by reducing thrombin synthesis with antibodies to factors II and X. To decouple the role of thrombin in platelet recruitment by direct stimulation of platelet activity from its role in thrombus stabilization via fibrin formation, thrombosis was measured in heparinized blood treated with the tetrapeptide glycyl-prolyl-arginyl-proline, which inhibits fibrin monomer assembly into fibrin. The ultimate level but not the initial rate of platelet accumulation was reduced markedly, indicating a role for fibrin in thrombus stabilization against hemodynamic forces. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated fibrin stands in the heparinized control samples but not in the heparinized samples with glycyl-prolyl-arginyl-proline. These results demonstrate a role for the local action of thrombin synthesized on the surfaces of thrombi even under conditions when the thrombin exerts no bulk effect, such as under heparin anticoagulation. Furthermore, this role appears to be a result of both platelet recruitment and thrombus stabilization. \nCorrelation between molecular and clinical events in the evolution of chronic myelocytic leukemia to blast crisis. A patient with typical Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) was studied during sequential phases of disease: (1) initial chronic phase; (2) myeloid blast crisis; (3) second chronic phase; and (4) accelerated disease. A point mutation in the coding sequence of the p53 gene first appeared concomitantly with the blast crisis and then disappeared with the re-establishment of a second chronic phase. The chromosomal concomitant of the molecular alteration was a deletion of 17p. These observations suggest that abnormalities of the p53 anti-oncogene are temporally related to the clinical progression of some cases of CML and are probably responsible for the development of blast crisis in these cases. \nDetection of silent myocardial ischemia in diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of silent myocardial ischemia and its relation to autonomic dysfunction and pain threshold was studied in 58 men with diabetes mellitus and without cardiac symptoms. All patients underwent 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise testing after assessment of their autonomic function and pain threshold. Silent myocardial ischemia, defined as greater than or equal to 1 mm of ST-segment depression on either exercise testing or ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, was corroborated by exercise-induced reversible defect(s) on tomographic thallium scintigraphy. Autonomic function was assessed by heart rate response to: (1) Valsalva maneuver, (2) deep breathing, and (3) upright posture, as well as by diastolic blood pressure response to sustained handgrip and systolic blood pressure response to upright posture. Autonomic dysfunction was defined as greater than or equal to 2 abnormal responses. Pain threshold measurements were performed using electrical cutaneous stimulation of both forearms. Of the 58 diabetic patients, 21 were found to have autonomic dysfunction (36%). Silent myocardial ischemia was detected in 10 patients (17%), and was significantly more frequent in patients with than without autonomic dysfunction (38 vs 5%, p = 0.003). There was no difference in the electrical pain threshold or tolerance in subjects with and without silent myocardial ischemia. It is concluded that silent myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic diabetic men occurs frequently and in association with autonomic dysfunction, suggesting that diabetic neuropathy may be implicated in the mechanism of silent myocardial ischemia. \nUse of prophylactic otic drops after tympanostomy tube insertion. In a 1-year prospective study, 60 patients with chronic serous otitis media underwent bilateral tympanocentesis with tube insertion. The right ear was treated with dexapolyspectran (a solution consisting of polymyxin B sulfate, neomycin sulfate, sulfonamide, and hydrocortisone) intraoperatively and for 72 hours afterward, and the left ear served as the control. All patients were followed up at weekly intervals for the first month. Five (8.3%) out of 60 experimental ears had purulent otorrhea within the first 14 days after surgery, compared with eight (13.3%) out of 60 control ears. Statistical analysis showed no difference between the two groups. \nPancreatic islet cell carcinoma with hypercalcemia: complete remission 5 years after surgical excision and chemotherapy. A 45-yr-old man who presented with hypercalcemia was found to have an abdominal mass that was a pancreatic islet cell carcinoma. Although clinical features were suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism, his parathyroid hormone level was not elevated. The patient underwent a radical resection of the pancreatic neoplasm which was situated in the tail of the gland. After surgery, the serum calcium fell within the normal range, suggesting that the tumor was responsible for production of a parathyroid hormone-like substance. Because of malignant histologic features of the lesion, a chemotherapeutic regimen including 5-fluorouracil and streptozotocin was indicated. Five years later, the tumor has remained in total remission. \nRapid detection of the A----G(8344) mutation of mtDNA in Italian families with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERRF). We devised a rapid PCR-based method to screen for an A----G transition at nucleotide 8344 of the human mitochondrial tRNA(Lys) gene, which was recently reported, by Shoffner and co-workers, to be associated with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERRF), a maternally transmitted mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (Shoffner et al. 1990). We confirmed this association in five of seven Italian MERRF pedigrees. The mutation was specific for the MERRF trait, because it was never found in mtDNA of non-MERRF individuals, including 14 normal and 110 diseased controls. Our study corroborates the idea that the A----G(8344) mutation is the most frequent and widespread genetic cause of MERRF. \n\"Ex vivo\" release of eicosanoid from human brain tissue: its relevance in the development of brain edema. The specific mechanism underlying the genesis of vasogenic brain edema is still debated: the role of arachidonic acid is considered extremely important, as it is a possible activator of self-maintaining reactions enhancing the release of vasoactive and cytotoxic compounds. The relationship between arachidonic acid metabolism and brain edema has been studied primarily in brain tissue samples or in the extracellular fluid, whereas the residual capacity of perilesional tissue to synthesize and release eicosanoids has not been investigated. In the present study, perilesional samples of brain tissue were available from 4 patients operated on for brain metastasis, from 8 patients who had malignant neuroepithelial tumors, from 4 with meningiomas, and from 5 with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A brain edema index was calculated from the preoperative computed tomographic scan. The \"ex vivo\" method allowed determination of the residual capacity of endogenous arachidonic acid metabolism. The edema index is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis (6.5 +/- 0.8) and neuroepithelial tumors (3.6 +/- 0.2) than in those with meningiomas (1.5 +/- 0.06), subarachnoid hemorrhage (1.7 +/- 0.18), and in controls. In patients with metastatic and neuroepithelial tumors there is a significant correlation between peritumoral brain edema and the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 (P less than 0.05); the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 is also significantly elevated after subarachnoid hemorrhage (13.91 +/- 2.6 ng/ml of incubation medium) when compared with control cases (5.56 +/- 0.91). The capacity to synthesize prostacyclin is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis than in those with neuroepithelial tumors and meningiomas (P less than 0.05). \nPentoxifylline restores intestinal microvascular blood flow during resuscitated hemorrhagic shock. We studied the intestinal microvascular blood flow responses to hemorrhage and resuscitation with pentoxifylline by in vivo video microscopy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were hemorrhaged to 50% of baseline mean arterial pressure for 45 minutes and then blindly randomized to receive pentoxifylline (25 mg/kg bolus + 0.2 mg/kg/minute) or an equivalent volume of saline plus return of shed blood and an additional bled volume of Ringer's lactate solution. Hemorrhage caused intestinal microvascular blood flow to decrease to 10% to 15% of baseline values. In the control group, resuscitation restored cardiac output and mean arterial pressure to baseline values, but intestinal microvascular blood flow remained at 30% of baseline values. In contrast, addition of pentoxifylline to the resuscitation regimen resulted in an immediate hyperemic response with an increase in intestinal microvascular blood flow to significantly greater than baseline values followed by return to baseline. Arteriolar dilation was not responsible for the improvement in flow implicating improved flow dynamics between erythrocytes, granulocytes, and vascular endothelia within the microcirculation. We conclude that addition of pentoxifylline to resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock restores intestinal microvascular blood flow. \nThe acute and chronic antihypertensive effects of ketanserin cannot be explained by blockade of vascular serotonin, type 2, receptors or alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The mechanism underlying the antihypertensive effect of acute and chronic administration of ketanserin was investigated in eight hypertensive patients. Intrabrachial artery infusions of serotonin and the selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist methoxamine were given before and 1 hour after a single oral dose of 20 mg ketanserin and after 4 weeks of treatment with 20 to 40 mg twice daily. Blood pressure was reduced by ketanserin both after the initial dose (p less than 0.01) and after 4 weeks of treatment (p less than 0.01). During placebo, serotonin, 1 ng/kg/min, increased forearm blood flow by 51% +/- 9% (p less than 0.01), whereas the highest dose induced a decrease in flow (-33% +/- 6%; p less than 0.01). Methoxamine elicited a vasoconstriction (p less than 0.001). These effects of serotonin and methoxamine were not influenced by either the initial dose of ketanserin or after 4 weeks of treatment. It is concluded that serotonin cannot be considered a general endogenous pressor agent in these patients. The antihypertensive effects of ketanserin cannot be attributed to either vascular alpha 1-receptor or serotonin, type 2, receptor blockade. \nLiver transplantation after paracetamol overdose. OBJECTIVE--To evaluate the role of liver transplantation after paracetamol overdose. DESIGN--Prospective study of consecutive candidates for transplantation and performance of transplantation over 18 months. SETTING--Liver unit, King's College Hospital, London. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Fulfilment of indicators of poor prognosis, selection for transplantation, transplantation, survival. RESULTS--30 of 37 patients considered to have a reasonable prognosis with intensive medical care survived. Of 14 of 29 patients considered to have a very poor prognosis and registered for urgent liver transplantation, six received liver transplants, four of whom survived, while seven died and one survived without a transplant. Three of 15 patients with poor prognostic indicators but not selected for transplantation survived. CONCLUSION--Liver transplantation will have a definite but limited role in the management of fulminant hepatic failure induced by paracetamol. \nThe perils of Pauline: visual loss in a tippler [clinical conference] A 31-year-old alcoholic woman who smoked had subacute visual loss. She was treated for tobacco-alcohol amblyopia with subsequent improvement in vision. \nLack of impact of early antibiotic therapy for streptococcal pharyngitis on recurrence rates. To determine whether recurrence rates for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis are related to the time of initiation of antibiotic therapy, we randomly assigned 113 patients with GABHS pharyngitis either to a group that began a 10-day course of penicillin V at the time of diagnosis or to a group that began the same antibiotic regimen after a dealy of 48 hours. Follow-up throat culture specimens were obtained 4 days, 2 months, and 4 months after the completion of antibiotic therapy, as well as during any interim episodes of acute pharyngitis. Serotyping of all GABHS isolates was performed to distinguish between recurrences with homologous serotypes and new acquisitions with heterologous serotypes. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in age, gender, duration of illness before enrollment in the study, initial clinical presentation, or compliance. Of the 50 patients in the immediate-treatment group, 6 (12%) had homologous serotypes of GABHS isolated on one of the follow-up throat cultures. Of the 63 patients in the delayed-treatment group, 9 (14%) had homologous serotypes of GABHS isolated on one of the follow-up throat cultures. These data indicate that a 48-hour delay in the initiation of penicillin therapy for GABHS pharyngitis does not reduce the recurrence rate. \nEndocrine and reproductive dysfunction following fractionated total body irradiation in adults. The endocrine and reproductive sequelae of total body irradiation for haematological malignancy have been studied in 21 patients (11 male) who were treated with 10 Gy in five fractions or 12 or 13.2 Gy in six fractions over 3 days. Eighteen patients (eight male) aged 16-49 years underwent dynamic tests of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with insulin hypoglycaemia, thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) and gonadotrophin releasing hormone stimulation and basal measurement of prolactin, sex steroids and thyroid hormones. Growth hormone responses (mean peak 64 +/- 36 mU/l, range 21-146 mU/l) and cortisol responses (mean peak 831 +/- 122 nmol/l, range 626-1105 nmol/l) were all within the normal range. Two patients had minimally elevated serum prolactin levels (445 and 588 mU/l, normal less than 350 mU/l). Serum thyroxine levels (57-133 nmol/l) were normal but six patients had elevated basal thyrotrophin (TSH) levels (6-9 mU/l) and seven had an exaggerated TSH response to thyrotrophin releasing hormone, indicating radiation-induced damage to the thyroid. Amenorrhea developed within 3 months of irradiation in all females and oestradiol levels were low, at 37-108 pmol/l (mean 58 +/- 22 pmol/l). Severe oligospermia or azoospermia was noted in men tested 5-70 months after irradiation and testicular volume was below the normal adult range in five of seven men assessed. Serum testosterone levels (12.4-35 nmol/l) were normal. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-stimulated gonadotrophin levels were elevated in all patients. However, two men have fathered two children each; one has refused semen analysis, but the other has a sperm count of 7 x 10(6)/ml (60 per cent motile, 20 per cent abnormal forms) 70 months after irradiation. When given by the above fractionated regimens, the endocrine sequelae of total body irradiation are limited to gonadal failure requiring oestrogen replacement in women and severe impairment of fertility in men. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been seen in 39 per cent of patients there is no evidence of direct damage to the hypothalamic pituitary axis. \nSteroid-responsive tubular aggregate myopathy. We report a man with an acute myalgia/cramp syndrome and tubular aggregates on his muscle biopsy. He was placed on prednisone and was found to be exquisitely sensitive to the drug, with changes of only 5 mg precipitating recurrence of symptoms. He was eventually tapered off all steroids, without symptoms, and repeat biopsy showed no tubular aggregates. We recommend similar patients be given a trial of high-dose steroids. \nDoes racial variation in risk factors explain black-white differences in the incidence of hypertensive end-stage renal disease? Prospectively collected data on the incidence of treated hypertensive end-stage renal disease (HT-ESRD) were analyzed to investigate whether the higher rate of HT-ESRD in blacks compared with whites is due to differences in putative ESRD risk factors. The overall age-adjusted relative risks of HT-ESRD for black compared with white residents in the Maryland Regional ESRD Registry (Network 31) Catchment Area were 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 5.9 to 9.4) and 9.9 (95% confidence interval, 7.4 to 13.1) for men and women, respectively. In a population level analysis, race-specific HT-ESRD incidence rates in the black and white populations of 13 regions in Network 31 were related to the prevalence of putative ESRD risk factors in those populations. The latter were estimated from the 1981-1982 Maryland Statewide Household Hypertension Survey. Black populations had a 5.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 8.1) higher unadjusted incidence of HT-ESRD than white populations. The HT-ESRD incidence in a population was also directly related to that population's prevalence of hypertension, severe hypertension, and diabetes mellitus and inversely related to measures of socioeconomic status and mean age at diagnosis of hypertension. When adjusted simultaneously for age, prevalence of hypertension, severe hypertension, diabetes, and level of education, the risk of HT-ESRD was still 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 3.2 to 6.2) times higher for black compared with white populations. Our findings failed to support the hypothesis that race-related differences in the prevalence, severity, or age at onset of hypertension, in the prevalence of diabetes or in socioeconomic status, explain the well-recognized black-white differences in the HT-ESRD incidence. \nThe prevalence of oral lesions in HIV-infected homosexual and bisexual men: three San Francisco epidemiological cohorts. To establish the prevalence of HIV-related oral lesions, we performed oral examinations of members of three San Francisco epidemiological cohorts of homosexual and bisexual men over a 3-year period. Hairy leukoplakia, pseudomembranous and erythematous candidiasis, angular cheilitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, and oral ulcers were more common in HIV-infected subjects than in HIV-negative subjects. Among HIV-infected individuals, hairy leukoplakia was the most common lesion [20.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.5-23.3%] and pseudomembranous candidiasis was the next most common (5.8%, 95% CI 4.1-7.5%). Hairy leukoplakia, pseudomembranous candidiasis, angular cheilitis and Kaposi's sarcoma were significantly more common in patients with lower CD4 lymphocyte counts (P less than 0.05). The prevalence of erythematous candidiasis and Kaposi's sarcoma increased during the 3-year period. Careful oral examinations may identify infected patients and provide suggestive information concerning their immune status. \nThe effect of streptokinase on chest pain in acute myocardial infarction. Treatment with intravenous streptokinase is known to restore blood flow to the ischaemic myocardium in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, little is known about its effect on chest pain. In a retrospective cohort study, 76 patients treated with streptokinase were compared to 76 patients not treated with streptokinase. All patients had acute myocardial infarction and less than 6 h of cardiac symptoms. Patients treated with streptokinase had a significantly lower need for nicomorphine (median 20 mg) than patients not treated with streptokinase (median 41 mg). Correspondingly, the median duration (3.5 h) of pain was reduced significantly in patients treated with streptokinase compared to patients not treated (24 h). We conclude that intravenous streptokinase given in the acute phase of myocardial infarction is effective in reducing the duration of cardiac chest pain. \nCure of early-stage Hodgkin's disease with subtotal nodal irradiation. Ninety-four consecutive patients with Stage I or II Hodgkin's disease who presented supradiaphragmatically were treated with radiation therapy alone at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology from January 1978 through December 1986. Fifty-two patients (55%) were staged pathologically, and 42 (45%) were staged clinically. The latter included lymphangiography and/or abdominal computed tomographic scan. Most patients with B symptoms and/or bulky disease were excluded from this series. Seventy-four patients were treated with subtotal nodal irradiation (mantle and periaortic fields). The spleen was treated if the patient had not undergone splenectomy. Twenty patients received mantle irradiation only. No patient received total nodal irradiation. All patients had an initial complete response. With a minimum follow-up of 7 months (median, 7.7 years; seven patients died before 3 years of follow-up, but all other patients had at least 3 years of follow-up), 81 patients (86%) remained disease-free. Six of 52 (12%) of the pathologically staged group had a relapse, as did seven of 42 (17%) of the clinically staged group (P = 0.68). Eight of 57 Stage I patients versus five of 37 Stage II patients had a relapse (P greater than 0.99). Analysis of disease-free survival by age, histologic findings, sex, and sites of involvement did not predict relapse. The pelvis was the most common site of failure (nine patients, 10%). However, only three patients (3%) failed in the pelvis alone. These results indicate that patients who, after adequate clinical staging with selective use of staging laparotomy, are found to have Stage I and II Hodgkin's disease may be treated with subtotal nodal irradiation with a high rate of cure. \nProlonged hemorrhagic shock does not impair regeneration of plasma coagulant masses in the rabbit. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Twelve adult male albino rabbits were assigned alternately to normotensive and hypotensive groups to assess the effect of hypovolemic shock on spontaneous correction of dilutional coagulopathy. All animals underwent dilutional exchange transfusion with 200 mL of rabbit RBCs and 5% human albumin. Half the animals were then acutely hemorrhaged and subsequent aliquots of blood removed as needed to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 40 mm Hg. RESULTS: By 6 hr after production of dilutional coagulopathy, masses and plasma concentrations of fibrinogen and Factor II had increased modestly but significantly, and Factor VII mass and concentration and in vitro coagulation had returned almost to normal; plasma volume was unchanged in the normotensive animals. In the hypovolemic shock animals, where coagulant mass regeneration was as rapid as in the normotensive animals, a doubling of total plasma volume (p less than .01) prevented the concentrations of fibrinogen and Factor II, and hence the coagulation times, from improving. CONCLUSIONS: Dilutional coagulopathy corrects spontaneously within hours. Normovolemic shock prolongs dilutional coagulopathy not by impairment of factor regeneration but because of further (internal) dilution due to plasma expansion. Rapid correction of dilutional coagulopathy is likely to necessitate cryoprecipitate administration. \nGenetics of colon cancer. Strikingly rapid advances in the identification of genetic events that are important in colonic carcinogenesis have been made in the past several years. Specific inherited (adenomatous polyposis coli gene) and acquired (ras gene point mutations; c-myc gene amplification; allelic deletion at specific sites on chromosomes 5, 17, and 18) genetic abnormalities appear to be capable of mediating steps in the progression from normal to malignant colonic mucosa. Understanding these genetic factors and how they influence cellular function will have a profound effect on medical practice. High-risk populations will be (and are being) identified by genetic markers, thus allowing prevention and screening to be more precisely targeted to the population at risk; intervention strategies will be designed on the basis of the known cellular defects of neoplastic colonic mucosa; and new molecular preventive and therapeutic approaches can be developed. \nRare intrathoracic complications in acute pancreatitis. Ascites and pleural effusions may complicate pancreatitis but pericarditis with pericardial effusion and tamponade is rare and necrosis of mediastinal fat has not been described before. All these complications occurred in the case reported here. \nReceptors for tumor necrosis factor on neoplastic B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia are expressed in vitro but not in vivo. Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine that induces proliferation of neoplastic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To gain insight into the mechanisms involved in regulating TNF responsiveness, we have examined TNF receptor expression on neoplastic B-CLL cells. We have demonstrated that freshly isolated neoplastic B cells from patients with CLL did not express TNF receptors. After 1 day of incubation in culture medium, TNF receptors were detectable in the range of 540 to 1,500/cell. Kinetic experiments revealed that receptor expression was half-maximal after 3 hours of culturing and required de novo protein synthesis. The Scatchard plots of TNF-alpha binding indicated a single set of high-affinity TNF receptors with a dissociation constant of 70 pmol/L. TNF receptor expression in vitro was found in all examined cases. All cytokines tested, with the exception of IL-2, did not influence the expression of TNF receptors. The TNF receptor expression is enhanced in B-CLL cells cultured in the presence of interleukin-2 when compared with the receptor expression of cells cultured in medium alone. Our data suggest that neoplastic B-CLL cells in patients with stable disease do not express TNF receptors in vivo and that an unknown mechanism suppressing TNF receptor expression in vivo may play a role in growth regulation of neoplastic B cells. \nBalloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of aorta. Immediate and long-term results BACKGROUND. As angioplasty techniques have been refined and larger low-profile balloons developed, a nonsurgical approach to recoarctation has become available. Several reports have documented both the efficacy and safety of this procedure. However, there are little data available on the long-term follow-up of these patients. This report details the initial results and long-term evaluation of both the relief of obstruction and the presence of hypertension after balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation. METHODS AND RESULTS. Balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of the aorta was performed 29 times in 26 patients at a median age of 4 years and 9 months (range, 4 months to 29 years), with eight patients less than 1 year old. Initial surgical techniques were end-to-end anastomosis in 11 patients, subclavian flap aortoplasty in 11 patients, and patch aortoplasty in four patients. Angioplasty was performed at a median interval of 2 years and 7 months (range, 4 months to 23 years) after surgery. Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the coarctation decreased from 40.0 +/- 16.8 to 10.3 +/- 9.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after the initial angioplasty, and mean diameter of the aortic lumen at the coarctation site increased from 5.8 +/- 3.5 to 9.0 +/- 4.3 mm (p less than 0.05). There was no mortality, and only one patient developed an aneurysm (4%). Three patients underwent repeat angioplasty for a pressure difference of more than 20 mm Hg. Long-term follow-up is available on 24 of 26 patients with a mean follow-up of 42 +/- 24 months (range, 12-88 months). Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the area of coarctation decreased from 40.3 +/- 17.4 before angioplasty to 8.5 +/- 8.3 mm Hg after final angioplasty (p less than 0.05) and 7.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg at follow-up. Mean peak systolic blood pressure in the upper extremities decreased from 133.1 +/- 14.9 before angioplasty to 111.1 +/- 14.1 mm Hg at long-term follow-up (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Balloon angioplasty should be considered the treatment of choice for relief of recurrent aortic coarctation. \nSyringomyelia secondary to congenital intraspinal lipoma. Preoperative evaluation using serial magnetic resonance imaging was performed on an infant with lumbosacral lipoma. Syrinx formation arising just above the lipoma was observed in conjunction with rapid growth of the lipoma. Definite shrinkage of syringomyelia was obtained after radical excision of the lipoma. The syrinx formation was possibly caused by compression from the extramedullary lipoma. \nLoss of the endothelin signal pathway in C6 rat glioma cells persistently infected with measles virus. Endothelin 1 causes a strong Ca2+ signal in C6 rat glioma cells as measured by fura-2 fluorescence. This endothelin 1-induced Ca2+ signal was not observed when the cells were persistently infected with a measles virus strain of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE, strain Lec). Binding of 125I-labeled endothelin 1 to the C6/SSPE cells was less than 5% of the binding to the C6 control cells, suggesting that the impairment in signal transduction was due to a loss of binding sites for endothelin 1. Treatment of the C6/SSPE cells with measles antiserum resulted in the loss of expression of viral proteins located in the membrane as well as inside the cells (antigenic modulation), but it restored neither the endothelin 1-induced Ca2+ rise nor the 125I-endothelin 1 binding. Cocultivation of uninfected C6 cells with C6/SSPE cells (9:1 ratio) resulting in contact-mediated transmission of measles virus showed that the 125I-endothelin 1 binding activity was gradually lost as a consequence of persistent virus infection. \nCerebrovascular accidents complicating pregnancy and the puerperium. The decreasing incidence of direct causes of maternal death over the past half century has led to a heightened awareness of nonobstetric factors responsible for maternal mortality. For example, cerebrovascular accidents are an important nonobstetric cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. During the 6.5-year period from 1984 to mid-1990, we encountered 15 women in whom pregnancy or the puerperium was complicated by an acute cerebrovascular accident. Six of these women had hemorrhagic strokes and nine had ischemic strokes. During this same time, approximately 90,000 women were delivered at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and thus the incidence of stroke was about one in 6000 pregnancies. Chronic hypertension or preeclampsia was causative in three cases of hemorrhagic stroke. It is important that 20% of the women died as a result of stroke, and of the 12 survivors, 40% have residual neurologic deficits. An aggressive work-up to define the etiology of stroke is necessary in order to implement cause-specific management, with subsequent reduction in morbidity and mortality. \nClinical results of mitral valve replacement with and without preservation of the posterior mitral valve leaflet and subvalvular apparatus. In this study we attempted to investigate the importance of posterior leaflet preservation during mitral valve replacement (MVR). One hundred and forty randomly selected patients with isolated mitral insufficiency were studied, half of whom had MVR with preservation of the posterior leaflet (Group I), whereas in the other half conventional MVR was performed, without preservation of the posterior leaflet (Group II). Within these two groups there were no in hospital deaths, but 5 patients in Group II were admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure and 3 of them died after approximately 6 months. Long term mortality rate was 4.2% in Group II. Ejection fraction (EF) decreased postoperatively from 56% to 50% in Group I (p less than 0.05), and from 59% to 49% in Group II (p less than 0.05). Fifteen patients in each group and aged below 30 with sinus rhythm and in the first functional capacity according to the New York Heart Association classification (NYHA) were subjected to exercise study, 18 months after the operation. After exercise EF increased from 47% to 64% in Group I and decreased from 51% to 47% in Group II. These findings suggested that MVR with the preservation of the chordae tendineae can be done with a low morbidity and mortality rate in the early and late postoperative period. \nPlatelet-activating factor produces shock, in vivo complement activation, and tissue injury in mice. We previously showed that TNF and endotoxin (LPS) synergize to activate the complement system and produce shock and bowel injury in normal mice. However, C5-deficient mice were protected from these adverse effects. In this study, we show that in mice, platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist prevents TNF- and LPS-induced complement activation, bowel injury, and death, indicating that PAF mediates the actions of TNF and LPS. We then examined the role of the complement system in PAF-induced shock and tissue injury. We found that 1) PAF (3 micrograms/kg) induces shock, hemoconcentration, bowel necrosis, and death in normal mice, whereas C5-deficient mice are protected from these effects. (Protection was abrogated when the dose of PAF was raised to 5 micrograms/kg.) Furthermore, when C5-deficient mice were reconstituted with normal serum, they also developed shock, bowel injury, and death in response to PAF. Thus, C5 is required for PAF to induce injury. 2) PAF activates the complement system in vivo, but not in vitro. The mechanism of complement activation by PAF is unclear. Inasmuch as PAF stimulates neutrophils to release protease that may activate the complement system, we examined the effect of neutrophil depletion on PAF-induced injury and complement activation. We found that neutrophil depletion fails to prevent PAF-induced complement activation, although PAF-induced lethality is much reduced. We conclude that PAF causes complement activation, and acts in synergy with active complement fragments to produce shock and tissue injury. Neutrophils probably do not play the pivotal role in PAF-induced complement activation. \nEvaluation of the Graseby PCAS. A clinical and laboratory study. The Graseby patient-controlled analgesia system was evaluated in the laboratory and in clinical use. The problems encountered with eight examples used to treat 510 patients are reported. Laboratory performance revealed the unit to be accurate at infusion volumes of 1 and 2 ml. \nOccupational and industrial toxin exposures and the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal Toxicology Subcommittee of the American College of Gastroenterology Patient Care Committee. The subcommittee on Gastrointestinal Toxicology of the Patient Care Committee of the American College of Gastroenterology has reviewed potential effects of exposures to occupational and industrial hazards on the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas. This review is presented to 1) share clinical data concerning gastrointestinal toxicology, 2) emphasize the paucity of available information to the practicing clinician, and 3) stimulate basic research interest in this field. \nNecrotizing fasciitis. Ten cases of necrotizing fasciitis are reviewed. Three patients died but only two of these deaths were due to uncontrolled septicaemia. All isolated organisms were sensitive to a combination of piperacillin and ampicillin which we now regard as the initial antibiotic combination of choice. Prompt and aggressive surgical debridement remains the cornerstone of management. \nBreast specimen microcalcifications: radiographic validation and pathologic-radiologic correlation. A prospective analysis of specimens from location and biopsy of mammographically suspect microcalcifications in 108 patients was carried out to determine if microcalcifications were lost during histopathologic processing and the clinical relevance of such loss. Nine hundred sixty-eight paraffin blocks were prepared from 425 gross tissue slices containing calcifications identified at radiography of the specimens. Calcium was apparently lost both during preparation of the blocks (13.6%) and after slide preparation (12.6%), for a total possible loss of 26.2%. All specimens demonstrated calcification histologically. One pathology report was amended because of information obtained after recuts, but all cancers were detected on original slides whether or not calcifications were identified initially. The results indicate that, by following the suggestions offered to ensure adequate histopathologic sampling of calcification seen at mammography, most if not all of the calcification present can be detected on the original slide. \nA cluster of related zinc finger protein genes is deleted in the mouse embryonic lethal mutation tw18. We report that a number of related zinc finger protein genes are closely linked on mouse chromosome 17. At least four of these genes are transcribed in the 8.5-day postcoitum embryo and are deleted in the t complex early acting embryonic lethal mutation tw18. We have evidence that additional finger protein genes are located in this region. These findings demonstrate that related finger protein genes can be clustered in the murine genome and identify genes that may be considered as candidates for the tw18 mutation. \nRemote cortical dysfunction in aphasic stroke patients. We studied the effect of deep-seated left hemispheric lesions on cortical blood flow in 18 right-handed aphasic stroke patients. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured at rest and during the performance of a functional naming test using the two-dimensional xenon-133 inhalation method. Compared with 10 controls, at rest the patients showed regional cortical hypoperfusion in the left frontoparietal region. In the controls, activation patterns from the rest to the test condition involved mainly the left hemisphere areas. In the patients, a lack of blood flow change was observed in several areas that were usually hypoperfused at rest. However, in patients with slight verbal expression disorders there were obvious blood flow increases in other brain regions in both hemispheres. Such cortical functional reorganization and the presence of a remote cortical dysfunction could play a role in the pathophysiology of language disorders. \nIn vitro perfused-superfused cat carotid body for physiological and pharmacological studies. An in vitro perfused carotid body preparation was developed to study its chemosensory responses to physiological and pharmacological stimuli. The carotid bifurcation with the carotid body was vascularly isolated and excised from pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized cats. The CB was perfused in a chamber by gravity (80 Torr) with modified Tyrode's solution (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid-NaOH at pH 7.40) equilibrated at a given Po2 and superfused with the same medium at (Po2 of 20 Torr). The temperature was maintained at 35.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The frequency of chemosensory discharges (CD) was recorded from the whole carotid sinus nerve (n = 24), and the responses were tested by repeated interruptions of perfusate flow (SF), perfusion with hypoxic medium, and injections of nicotine and cyanide (0.1 nmol to 1 mumol) and hypercapnic medium. During hyperoxic perfusion, SF resulted in a sigmoidal increase in CD, reaching a maximum that was 23.6 +/- 4.4-fold greater than the basal activity. Restoration of flow returned CD promptly to basal values. After normoxic perfusion, SF led to a similar maximal activity more rapidly, but the duration was shorter. Reduction of the perfusate PO2 (Po2 from 450 Torr to 150, 30, and less than 10 Torr) caused a nonlinear increase in CD. CO2 stimuli (PCo2 38-110 Torr) resulted in a linear increase in CD. Nicotine or cyanide increased CD in a dose-dependent manner. The preparation retained its initial responsiveness for 2-3 h, making extensive experimental studies feasible. \nEvaluation of three oral dosages of ondansetron in the prevention of nausea and emesis associated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin chemotherapy. We assessed the antiemetic efficacy and safety of three different oral doses of ondansetron (GR 38032F), a novel serotonin type-3 receptor antagonist, in three consecutive series of 20 breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for the first time. Patients received oral doses of 8 mg, 4 mg, or 1 mg of ondansetron three times daily for 2 days, with the first dose given 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamide infusion. We then evaluated the efficacy of a conventional antiemetic regimen of intravenous lorazepam, metoclopramide, and diphenhydramine given before chemotherapy and 10 mg prochlorperazine given orally twice on study day 1 and three times on study day 2 in a fourth series of 20 patients with comparable characteristics. The number of emetic episodes, assessment of nausea and appetite, and adverse events were recorded throughout the 2-day study period. Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical laboratory data were also collected. No emesis was observed during the 2-day study period in 17 (85%), 13 (65%), and 11 (55%) patients treated with 8-mg, 4-mg, and 1-mg ondansetron doses, respectively, and in seven (35%) patients who received conventional therapy. The incidence and intensity of nausea were lower with increasing doses of ondansetron and were lower than in the conventional group. Ondansetron-related side effects were generally mild and reversible and did not appear to increase in a dose-dependent manner. These effects included headache, stomach cramps, diarrhea, fatigue, and elevated serum transaminase concentrations. One patient who received three 1 mg doses of ondansetron experienced tremors and muscle twitching. Oral ondansetron is an effective and safe antiemetic for patients receiving noncisplatin cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, and its antiemetic activity appears to be dose-related. \nGerm cell tumors masquerading as central nervous system sarcoidosis. The diagnosis of central nervous system sarcoidosis is uncertain without typical multisystem involvement. We describe two patients with isolated central nervous system mass lesions whose biopsy results were consistent with sarcoidosis. After a progressive clinical course, they were found to have diencephalic germinomas. Germ cell tumors, in particular, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of central nervous system sarcoidosis as they are potentially treatable, occur in intracranial locations favored by sarcoidosis mass lesions, and may be surrounded by granulomatous inflammation that can be mistaken for the noncaseating granulomas of sarcoidosis. \nCirculating ICAM-1 isoforms: diagnostic prospects for inflammatory and immune disorders. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) is an important early marker of immune activation and response. Evidence on its role has come from immunohistological staining of tissues, since no free circulating ICAM-1 has been detected. By means of monoclonal antibodies against ICAM-1 and a sensitive chemiluminescence technique, free circulating ICAM-1 was detected in serum from sixteen healthy young volunteers. The concentrations varied among the subjects. Non-denaturing gel separation methods showed that ICAM-1 circulates in at least three isoforms, the proportions of which also varied. These findings have important implications for the investigation, diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring of various inflammatory, neoplastic, and immune disorders. \nBiology of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from malignant disease in Western society. Apart from the fortunate few patients who present with a resectable small pancreatic adenocarcinoma, conventional treatment offers no hope of cure and has little palliative value. Over the past two decades major steps have been made in our understanding of the biology of pancreatic growth and neoplasia. This review sets out to explore these advances, firstly in the regulation of normal pancreatic growth, and secondly the mechanism which may be involved in malignant change of the exocrine pancreas. From an understanding of this new biology, new treatment strategies may be possible for patients with pancreatic cancer. \nMicroanalysis of bile acid composition in intrahepatic calculi and its etiological significance. Brown pigment stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts were compared with those found in the extrahepatic bile ducts with special reference to the bile acids modified by bacterial intervention, that is, unconjugated, glucuronidated, secondary, and ketonic bile acid fractions. The former showed significantly lower amounts of total bile acids (P less than 0.01) and lower proportions of unconjugated bile acid fraction (P less than 0.01), secondary bile acid fraction (P less than 0.05), and ketonic bile acid fraction (P less than 0.05) to total bile acids than the latter. The discriminant analysis using these bile acid parameters led to complete separation between intrahepatic and extrahepatic stones in the case of brown pigment stones. In contrast, cholesterol stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts showed the bile acid composition close to those found in the extrahepatic ducts and gallbladder. The above data show that the bacterial infection plays a less important role in the formation and ensuing growth of most intrahepatic brown pigment stones than in extrahepatic stones, and that factors other than or in addition to bacterial infection are involved. \nA prospective study of respiratory failure after high-risk surgery on the thoracoabdominal aorta. From June 1960 to September 1990, 1414 patients underwent repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, of whom 112 (8%) had pulmonary complications requiring respiratory support with tracheostomy; subsequently 45 (40%) died in the hospital. We determined by stepwise logistic regression analysis, in a prospective study of high-risk type I and II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms repairs, the independent predictors of respiratory failure, defined as respiratory ventilation exceeding 48 hours after operation. In 98 patients studied, 38 (39%) were women, 60 (61%) were men, 54 (55%) had type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 34 (35%) had aortic dissection, 19 (19%) were nonsmokers, 40 (41%) exsmokers, and 39 (40%) active smokers. Before operation, 55 (56%) had chronic pulmonary disease with respiratory failure developing in 58% (p = 0.0005 versus no chronic pulmonary disease, 10/43, 23%), and of the 26 patients in the lower quarter of forced expiratory volume (1 sec) (FEV1 less than or equal to 1.45 L) respiratory failure developed in 61% (p = 0.035). In-hospital survival was 98% and 83% (p = 0.008), respectively, and cumulative survival at 6 months by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 96% and 80% (p = 0.004, log-rank test), respectively, for patients without respiratory failure (N = 56/98, 57%) and with respiratory failure (N = 42/98, 43%). On univariate analysis, the following were associated with respiratory failure (p less than 0.05): FEV1, FEV1% predicted, FVC, FEF25, FEF25% predicted, FEF25-75, FEF25-75% predicted, PaCO2 Pao2, symptoms, smoking history, chronic pulmonary disease, cryoprecipitate volume, postoperative neuromuscular deficit, cardiac complications, reoperation for bleeding, renal complication, stress ulceration, postoperative creatinine level, postoperative dialysis, and postoperative encephalopathy. The independent predictors of respiratory failure were (p less than 0.05): chronic pulmonary disease, smoking history, cardiac and renal complications. In patients with chronic pulmonary disease, the only independent predictor was FEF25 (p = 0.030). These observations may be of value in selecting patients for elective operation. \nNonpharmacologic treatment of periodic leg movements in sleep. The effects of a 30-minute stimulation of the dorsiflexors of the feet and toes before bedtime were investigated in eight patients with periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS). None were taking medications at the time of the investigation. All subjects were treated with the EMS-250 Neuromuscular Stimulator, which has a maximum output per channel of 1.5mA and a frequency of 47Hz. Stimuli were delivered via a pulse train (on for 1.5sec and off for 1.8sec). A single all-night polysomnogram after this stimulation showed that all patients responded to stimulation, with reduction of leg movements from an average pretreatment PLMS index of 44.6 per hour to a posttreatment PLMS index of 14 per hour (p less than .01). Nocturnal leg movements were primarily reduced during the non-REM sleep. Multiple indices of sleep continuity did not change significantly, although there was a trend toward better sleep consolidation. \nAbsent or reversed end diastolic flow velocity in the umbilical artery and necrotising enterocolitis. Absent or reversed end diastolic flow (AREDF) velocities in the umbilical artery were identified in 25 high risk pregnancies. In six pregnancies the fetus was abnormal and all but one of these ended in perinatal death. Of the 19 morphologically normal fetuses, three died in utero and there were four neonatal or infant deaths. The mortality rate was 48% for all pregnancies and 37% for those with morphologically normal fetuses. There was a highly significant increased risk for the development of necrotising enterocolitis in these morphologically normal fetuses with AREDF (53%) compared with controls (6%) who did have umbilical artery end diastolic flow velocities in fetal life. There were no significant differences between the matched pairs for parameters of neonatal outcome chosen to reflect neonatal morbidity. These findings demonstrate the close association between AREDF and necrotising enterocolitis that appears to be independent of other variables such as degree of growth retardation, prematurity, and perinatal asphyxia. \nThe contributions of interpersonal conflict to chronic pain in the presence or absence of organic pathology. This study investigated the influences of social support and interpersonal conflict on chronic pain in patients with arthritis or with myofascial disorders. Measures of social support, conflict, and pain were drawn from subscales of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, the Family Environment Scale, and the Interpersonal Relationship Inventory. Patients with myofascial disorders reported significantly worse pain (sensory and affective), higher depression scores, more interpersonal conflict, and less support from others than patients with arthritis, but did not differ from them on personality traits. Also, the contributions of conflict to pain were found to depend on the nature of the chronic disorder and on the source of the conflict, i.e., significant other, family, or social network members. For patients with arthritis, less intense pain (sensory and affective) was associated with higher family conflict. Less intense sensory pain in arthritis was also associated with more punishing responses from the significant other to pain. For patients with myofascial disorders, more intense affective pain was associated with higher social network conflict. Social support did not significantly contribute to pain for either group. Thus, chronic painful disorders may differ on the influences that social relationships have on pain. The implications of these differences for treatment are discussed. \nTotal avulsion of an osseointegrated screw. The close union achieved between pure grade titanium and healthy bone makes dislocation a rare event. We report the case of the total avulsion of an apparently well-integrated implant from a healthy mastoid bone. \nUniparental heterodisomy for chromosome 14 in a phenotypically abnormal familial balanced 13/14 Robertsonian translocation carrier. A 9-year-old mentally retarded girl with multiple congenital anomalies was found to carry a balanced 13/14 Robertsonian translocation [45,XX,t(13q14q)] which was also present in her father. Her mother carried a balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 1 and 14 [46,XX,t(1;14) (q32;q32)]. Both of her parents were phenotypically normal. Molecular studies were carried out to determine the parental origin of chromosomes 1, 13, and 14 in the patient. Using probes for D14S13 and D14S22, we could show that the patient inherited both chromosomes 14 from her father and none from her mother. Similar studies using probes for chromosomes 1 (D1S76) and 13 (D13S37) loci showed the presence of both maternal and paternal alleles in the patient. Our findings indicate that paternal uniparental heterodisomy for chromosome 14 most likely accounts for the phenotypic abnormalities observed in our patient. It is suggested that uniparental disomy may be the basis for abnormal development in at least some phenotypically abnormal familial balanced-translocation carriers. \nSleep difficulties, pain and other correlates. A multiple regression analysis was used with variables relevant to sleeping problems from a large community health survey in South Australia. The variables that were found to be most strongly correlated with sleep problems were, in order of importance, pain, anxiety, age, somatic health and annual household income, all of which accounted for 22% of the variance. Weight problems, depression and sex of the respondent were not so important in this analysis. Arthritis, which often increases with age, appeared to be most strongly associated with pain, explaining in part why sleeping problems increase with age. Anxiety, pain and poor somatic health were most strongly associated with lying awake at night or sleeping badly, and anxiety and pain were most strongly correlated with taking longer to get to sleep. Poor somatic health and anxiety were most strongly associated with waking early, and ",
