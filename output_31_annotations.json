The use of silicone T tubes for intubation of malignant tracheobronchial strictures may provide some degree of palliation of this distressing condition. It was used in seven patients with malignant lesions and two with benign strictures (resulting from tracheal trauma and lung transplantation). Four patients (two with cancer) are still alive and well with the tube in position. All patients noted improvement in dyspnoea and stridor. The main problems were tube migration (one patient), tracheo-oesophageal fistula (one patient), and blockage of the tube by tumour (two patients) or encrusted secretions (three patients). Airway patency was restored when the tube was blocked by cleaning or by laser resection of the tumour. With careful supervision and education of the patient intubation can give useful palliation to patients with distressing upper airways obstruction. \nSelf-referred mammography patients: analysis of patients' characteristics. Among mammography patients, a small but growing group of highly motivated women refer themselves directly for screening without the suggestion of their physicians. We surveyed 485 patients during a 3-month period to study how self-referred mammography patients differ from physician-referred patients. Self-referred patients were more likely than physician-referred patients to have a family income of more than $30,000 per year, to be college graduates, and to consider their health as good or excellent. A large percentage of self-referred patients performed other health-promoting practices, but were not significantly more likely to do these than were physician-referred patients. Women who referred themselves were more likely to have a friend with breast cancer and to believe that cancer could be cured. They expressed much less worry about radiation exposure and were more likely to consider $50.00 an appropriate charge for a screening mammogram. By far, the greatest motivator for self-referred patients was health promotion and disease prevention. Self-referred mammography patients tend to be wealthier, more education, and less concerned about the cost and radiation dose of mammography when compared with physician-referred mammography patients. \nGenotypic analysis of diffuse, mixed cell lymphomas. Comparison with morphologic and immunophenotypic findings. Malignant lymphoma, diffuse, mixed small and large cell type, as defined in the Working Formulation, is heterogeneous both morphologically and immunophenotypically and, in some cases, clonality may be difficult to determine. Because gene rearrangement analysis has been shown to be a sensitive method for determining clonality, the authors genotyped 20 cases and compared the results with histologic and immunophenotypic findings. Immunophenotypic studies demonstrated that all lesions were composed predominantly of T cells. In addition, in eight cases either a monoclonal B-cell population (five lesions) or an aberrant immunophenotype (two T, one B) was detected, supporting a malignant diagnosis. In seven of these eight lymphomas, genotypic analysis confirmed the presence of a population of clonal cells. One case with an abnormal T-cell phenotype was germline. In 12 cases the immunophenotypic results were uncertain (i.e., no clonal population or abnormal immunophenotype was identified). Genotypic analysis provided evidence of clonality in eight. In four cases with uncertain immunophenotypic results, a clonal population also could not be identified with the use of Southern blot analysis. Thus, the authors conclude that gene rearrangement analysis is a valuable tool in the study of diffuse mixed cell lymphomas and is complementary to immunophenotypic studies. In addition, the authors analyzed the major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 protooncogene on chromosome 18, either by Southern blot analysis and/or with the polymerase chain reaction. The authors identified the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation in seven B-cell lymphomas, five of which were not considered to be of follicular center cell type on the basis of morphologic findings. These results suggest that the histologic spectrum of follicular center cell lymphomas is greater than is appreciated in the literature. \nDirect myocardial revascularization without extracorporeal circulation. Experience in 700 patients Between May 1978 and March 1990, 700 patients were operated on with direct coronary surgery without extracorporeal circulation (ECC): 529 (76 percent) were male and 171 (24 percent) were female. The average age was 64 years (range, 35 to 86 years), 454 (65 percent) had unstable angina, 163 (23 percent) had stable angina, 51 (7 percent) had postmyocardial infarction angina, and 32 (5 percent) had acute myocardial infarction at the moment of the operation. In this series of patients, all branches of the coronary arteries were bypassed; the mammary artery was used in 40 percent of the cases, the average bypass per patient was 2.2 (range, 1 to 5), and 26 percent had associated disease of high risk to undergo ECC. The morbidity was 4 percent and the mortality for this series of patients was 1 percent; the probability of survival at seven years was 90 percent. This experience shows us that this surgery is an alternative in the treatment of coronary disease, especially for aged patients with associated disease, in some cases of acute transmural infarction, and also for patients who need coronary angioplasty. Also, it can improve the relation cost/benefit in coronary surgery. \nClues and pitfalls in stereotactic biopsy of the central nervous system. We present a 6-year experience on 307 stereotactic biopsy specimens of the central nervous system using Leksell's and Talairach's systems independently and either Leksell or Sedan needles. Patients with deep cerebral lesions (basal ganglia, parasellar, pineal, or third ventricle), those located in highly functional areas or those poorly defined on imaging studies, as well as candidates for brachytherapy, were selected. Smear examination during surgery was a routine procedure followed by conventional histologic methods. Ages ranged from 8 months to 81 years (mean, 33.64 years). The series comprised 258 tumors, 28 nonneoplastic cases, and 21 nondiagnostic samples. Of the 258 tumors, 179 were supratentorial, 28 were infratentorial, 36 were of the pineal area, and 15 were from sellar and suprasellar regions. Results of the histologic examination showed the following: astrocytic tumors, 148 (57.36%); oligodendroglial, 25 (9.68%); ependymal, six (2.32%); primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 17, including 14 pineoblastomas (5.45%) and three medulloblastomas (1.16%), seven lymphomas (2.71%), seven meningiomas (2.71%), four schwannomas (1.55%), eight craniopharyngiomas (3.10%), 12 germinomas (4.65%), and 20 metastases (7.78%). Nontumoral cases included six arteriovenous malformations, six pyogenic lesions, seven infarcts, two hematomas, one multiple sclerosis plaque, one Fahr, one progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, one tuberculosis, one cysticercosis, and one Chagas' encephalitis. Awareness of the cerebellar granular layer in infratentorial targets as well as glial reaction around craniopharyngiomas is essential to avoid misdiagnosis. Difficulties were basically differential diagnosis between well-differentiated astrocytomas vs glial reaction, as well as poorly differentiated neoplasms vs metastases. \nFunctional results after total or near total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation. Locally advanced tongue cancer is a devastating disease for which there are limited therapeutic options that will result in a high rate of cure while preserving function. To determine the oncologic effectiveness of total or near total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation and the possibility of speech and swallowing rehabilitation following treatment, we reviewed our experience with 27 patients treated between 1982 and 1989. Twenty-four patients were eligible for 2-year follow-up and their disease-specific survival was 51%. Swallowing was achieved initially in 18 patients (67%), while 12 had successful long-term deglutition (44%). Oral communication was accomplished in 25 patients (92%). Significant aspiration occurred in three patients and was severe enough to require interval laryngectomy in two patients. The role of laryngeal suspension, palatal augmentation prosthesis, and videofluoroscopy as rehabilitation adjuncts for the total glossectomy patient are described. \nEffect of primary-stage feline immunodeficiency virus infection on subsequent feline calicivirus vaccination and challenge in cats. The effect of experimental primary-stage feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection on feline calicivirus (FCV) vaccination and challenge in cats was studied. Clinical signs of acute FCV disease were more widespread in the cats which were infected with FIV than in those which were not. FIV infection also prolonged shedding of FCV, with more of the FIV-infected cats becoming chronic carriers. Although vaccination induced protection against acute FCV disease, this was to a lesser degree in FIV-infected cats. Vaccination by itself also appeared to enhance long-term virus shedding. There was evidence of an impaired anamnestic FCV-neutralizing antibody response in FIV-infected cats following FCV challenge. \nCongenital atresia of left main coronary artery: proposed mechanism for severe disabling angina in a patient with non-atherosclerotic single right coronary artery--a case report. A patient with progressive disabling angina was found to have a single right coronary artery with atresia of the left main coronary artery, and absence of any obstructive coronary disease. The patient required aortocoronary by-pass surgical reconstruction of a left main coronary artery to control her angina. Possible mechanisms for the development of her anginal pain are briefly discussed. \nClinical effects of allopurinol on intractable epilepsy. We studied the clinical efficacy of allopurinol as add-on therapy in 31 patients with intractable epilepsy. When administered for a short time, allopurinol was effective in 17 patients (55%); 8 were seizure-free, 8 had 75% decrease in seizure frequency, and 1 had greater than 50% decrease. Allopurinol was most effective in patients with localization-related epilepsy, especially in secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Allopurinol was not as effective in patients with Lennox syndrome or West syndrome, or in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants. When allopurinol was administered greater than 1 year, its initial effectiveness continued in 8 of 14 patients who exhibited initial improvement. In 2 of the remaining 6 patients, the initial improvement disappeared during the course of treatment but control was regained by increasing the dosage of allopurinol. Mild side effects were observed in 4 patients (13%): drowsiness in 3 and abdominal pain in 1. Allopurinol may be a useful antiepileptic drug (AED), and a double-blind placebo-controlled trial should be performed. \nCoronary angiography after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. PURPOSE: To review the status of emergency, urgent, routine, and selective angiography after intravenous thrombolytic therapy. DATA SOURCES: Relevant English-language articles published from January 1985 to July 1990 were identified through MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: For emergency angiography, four major randomized studies were reviewed and data from nine studies that incorporated rescue coronary angioplasty were pooled for meta-analysis. For urgent angiography, two controlled trials were reviewed. Comparisons of routine and selective angiography were done using data from two dedicated, large-scale, controlled trials and the ancillary findings of four other studies of reperfusion that incorporated angiography. DATA EXTRACTION: The review emphasizes the findings from multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Emergency coronary angiography is done primarily in preparation for primary or rescue angioplasty; the value of rescue angioplasty has yet to be assessed in a randomized trial, but technical success and reocclusion improve significantly after therapy with nonspecific plasminogen activators compared with relatively specific agents (success rate, 86% compared with 75%, respectively; P = 0.03; reocclusion rate, 10.9% compared with 26.8%, respectively; P less than 0.001). Urgent coronary angiography has value for treating recurrent ischemia, but patients who develop this complication after thrombolysis are likely to have a suboptimal outcome despite aggressive care. Studies support the use of either selective or routine angiography in uncomplicated patients after thrombolytic therapy; either approach is acceptable, but the former is more practical and may prove to be cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal follow-up for patients with evolving myocardial infarction who receive thrombolysis may incorporate coronary angiography at various stages. Although our ability to noninvasively detect reperfusion, reocclusion, or viable but ischemic myocardium is limited at present, available data may assist in selecting a catheterization strategy. \nImaging of vascular complications associated with renal transplants. Vascular complications associated with renal transplants are a significant cause of graft dysfunction. The most common complications are arterial and venous stenoses and thromboses and intrarenal and extrarenal arteriovenous fistulas and pseudoaneurysms. Although angiography is the imaging gold standard for the diagnosis of these disorders, Doppler sonography, scintigraphy, and occasionally CT are capable of detecting them. An awareness of the different imaging appearances of each complication will aid in their early detection and treatment. In this review, we present this information and provide a perspective on the relative roles of these techniques in the detection of vascular complications from renal transplants. \nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome with disseminated toxoplasmosis presenting as an acute pulmonary and gastrointestinal illness. Encephalitis due to the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii has emerged as a common cause of central nervous system disease in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Extraneural disease is less common and more difficult to diagnose. We report a case of widely disseminated toxoplasmosis that presented as acute gastrointestinal and pulmonary disease in a patient without a prior diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis was made only at autopsy. Antemortem diagnosis of disseminated T gondii infection requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and the prompt utilization of appropriate diagnostic testing. Since toxoplasmosis is a potentially treatable opportunistic infection, diagnosis allows the swift institution of anti-Toxoplasma therapy. \nRandomized dose-searching phase ILE/II trials of fractionation in radiation therapy for cancer. This article describes a new design, phase ILE/II dose searching, used in four prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trials of escalating total doses of hyperfractionated radiation. This design combines an experimental protocol with a statistical application of ranking and selection theory. Its purpose was to identify (within a certain margin of error) a dose that achieved the highest rate of clinical response from a set of doses that were tolerable in terms of both acute (within 90 days) and late (more than 90 days) toxic effects (LE). We calculated the number of patients required to reliably test toxicity under various assumptions. To determine the maximum tolerated total dose for hyperfractionated radiation, we randomly assigned patients with tumors that responded to radiation therapy in a dose-dependent manner from four body sites (lung, upper respiratory and digestive tract, bladder, and brain) to one of three regimens receiving total doses (D1, D2, or D3) differing by increments of 4.8 Gy. All patients received two fractions of 1.2 Gy each (separated by 4-6 hours) daily 5 days a week. The lowest total dose was set at the level considered tolerable with standard once-a-day radiation therapy. We tested tumor responses and late toxic effects of higher doses by assigning patients to these three regimens until acute effects and early estimates of late effects were found to be acceptable for the highest dose D3; thereafter, regimen D1 was closed, and additional patients were assigned to D2, D3, and D4 (an escalated total dose greater than D3 by an increment of 4.8 Gy). The assignment of patients was performed in a weighted manner (1:1:2), so that greater numbers were assigned to the highest dose regimen (whether D3 or D4) to allow rapid evaluation of the feasibility of the highest dose. \nFunctional significance of an overlapping consensus binding motif for Sp1 and Zif268 in the murine adenosine deaminase gene promoter. The murine adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene has a (G + C)-rich promoter that can support diverse tissue-specific gene expression. By using deletion and mutation analyses, we have identified a cis-acting \"repressor\" element located immediately upstream of the proximal Sp1 binding site in the ADA gene promoter. This repressor element was localized to a binding site for the immediate-early, serum-responsive, DNA binding factor Zif268. This Zif268 binding site partially overlaps a binding site for the general transcription activator Sp1. Disruption of the Zif268 binding site without disturbing the Sp1 binding motif abolished Zif268 binding and resulted in significantly elevated promoter function. Conversely, disruption of the proximal consensus Sp1 binding motif without disturbing the Zif268 binding site resulted in a loss of Sp1 binding at that region and greatly reduced promoter activity. Our results suggest that one function of Zif268 may be to down-regulate this type of mammalian gene promoter by competing with Sp1 for binding to the overlapping binding motif. \nN-myc genomic content and DNA ploidy in stage IVS neuroblastoma. DNA ploidy and N-myc genomic content were analyzed in a series of stage IVS neuroblastomas by flow cytometry and Southern blot hybridization, respectively. Of the 12 stage IVS neuroblastomas studied, nine were aneuploid (DNA index [DI] greater than 1), two were diploid (DI = 1), and one was not assessable for DNA content due to insufficient tumor material. N-myc gene amplification was present in two of 12 tumors. None of the aneuploid tumors exhibited N-myc amplification. Among the aneuploid neuroblastomas, the DIs were between 1.27 and 1.60, ie, in the near-triploid range. The follow-up from diagnosis ranged from 1 to 41 months (mean, 20 months). The nine neuroblastomas with near-triploid DNA content were free of disease at the end of the follow-up period. In contrast, a rapid and fatal tumor progression was observed for the three neuroblastomas with N-myc amplification and/or diploidy. Although involving only a limited series, these results strongly suggest that the combined analysis of DNA ploidy and N-myc genomic content could predict clinical outcome in stage IVS neuroblastoma and should help to identify patients for whom a more aggressive therapy is required. \nReport of a hidden case of overfeeding. Nutritional support is essential to the care of the critically ill patient, but complications of overfeeding can occur. Precise metabolic measurement by indirect calorimetry can detect problems of nutrition and allow adjustment in caloric intake. This case study illustrates the complications of carbon dioxide retention and inability to wean from mechanical ventilation with subsequent prevention of further complications. \nManagement of renal cell carcinoma with vena caval thrombi via cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest allows safe and effective removal of renal tumors with extensive thrombi involving the vena cava under controlled circumstances without permanent side effects. The technique averts extensive dissection of the inferior vena cava and occlusion of major vessels while providing up to 60 minutes of safe operating time in a bloodless field and complete visibility of the interior of the vena cava. Adjunctive procedures for tumor excision or cardiac revascularization can be performed at the same time without increased operative risk. \nMelanosis coli: a case report in a trauma patient and review of the literature. Melanosis Coli (MC) is a benign pigmentation disorder of the colon occasionally diagnosed at endoscopy. The authors report a case of M. coli in a patient with a gunshot to the abdomen, in whom the entity produced an interesting clinical picture, and a review of the literature on this condition. \nDental implants placed in a patient with multiple myeloma: report of case A 69-year-old male, under active treatment for multiple myeloma, fractured his left maxillary second premolar palatal abutment tooth and requested treatment because his upper partial denture no longer fit. Several other teeth were deemed hopeless, and construction of a maxillary complete denture presented problems. There are general contraindications regarding dental implant surgery in the terminally ill patient; however, in this case, the patient wished to maximize his quality of life and opted to undergo implant surgery. With close management, the treatment was successful. \nEffects of substance P on norepinephrine release from vascular adrenergic neurons in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This study was performed to investigate the role of substance P in the vascular adrenergic transmission in hypertension. In perfused mesenteric vasculatures prepared from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 7 to 10 weeks old) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), we have examined the effects of substance P on vascular responsiveness as well as on norepinephrine release from the vascular adrenergic neurons. In preliminary studies with normotensive Wistar rats, pressor responses and endogenous norepinephrine release during electrical nerve stimulation were inhibited by substance P in a dose-dependent manner. However, vasoconstrictor responses to exogenous norepinephrine were not affected by the peptide. In SHR, the stimulation-evoked pressor responses and norepinephrine release were enhanced compared with WKY. Alternatively, the suppression of these responses by substance P was significantly less in SHR than in WKY. These results demonstrate that substance P could have a modulatory effect on noradrenergic activity and cause a decrease in stimulation-evoked norepinephrine release from the vascular adrenergic neurons. The attenuated reduction of pressor responses and norepinephrine release by substance P in SHR might suggest insufficient regulation of vascular adrenergic transmission by the peptide in hypertension. \nControl of acute lower respiratory illness in the developing world: an assessment of vaccine intervention. The major bacterial and viral causes of morbidity and death due to acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in the developing world are amenable to control by vaccines. Initially, full use of measles, pertussis, and diphtheria vaccines, in appropriately scheduled programs, can make an immediate contribution to the reduction of severe respiratory infection. Emerging technologies offer the promise of vaccines against bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens that are suitable for infants and children in developing countries. These technologic advances include the use of protein-polysaccharide conjugates of endemic serotypes for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines and new approaches to the use of purified protein components or attenuated live virus with respiratory syncytial virus and paramyxovirus vaccines. Such vaccines should soon be available for evaluation in developing countries. It is timely to embark upon a program of development, evaluation, and worldwide deployment of vaccines for the control of ALRI. \nElectrophysiological effects of left ventricular hypertrophy. Effect of calcium and potassium channel blockade. BACKGROUND. To define the arrhythmogenic effects of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the intact heart, we carried out a detailed electrophysiological assessment in our previously validated feline aortic-banding model and then tested the effects of agents that blocked either the slow inward calcium or voltage-dependent potassium channel. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured intraventricular and interventricular conduction times, excitability thresholds, ventricular effective refractory periods, and monophasic action potential duration at several sites in cats with LVH as well as in concurrent control (sham-operated) cats. In addition, we assessed vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia using direct measurement of ventricular fibrillation (VF) thresholds and by standard techniques of programmed stimulation. Despite finding no difference between LVH and sham-operated cats in mean values for several electrophysiological parameters, the former group was significantly more vulnerable to VF, with more spontaneous VF and lower VF thresholds. Compared with the sham controls, LVH cats also had a greater dispersion of effective refractory period (35 +/- 11 versus 12 +/- 4 msec, p less than 0.01) and monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (69 +/- 25 versus 39 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.02). Verapamil had no significant effect on these electrophysiological parameters, nor did it affect VF threshold. However, risotilide, an inhibitor of the voltage-dependent potassium channel, narrowed dispersion of the effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration concomitant with a marked reduction in ventricular vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS. LVH has a pronounced effect on dispersion of refractoriness and repolarization and renders the ventricle more vulnerable to fibrillation. Blockade of the voltage-dependent potassium channel, but not the slow inward calcium channel, narrows the dispersion of recovery of excitability and protects against VF. \nAntihypertensive effects of isradipine and captopril as monotherapy or in combination. The antihypertensive effects of isradipine and captopril were studied in 140 patients (70 men) with mild-to-moderate hypertension, aged 26 to 74 years, in a double-blind, randomized, between-patient comparative trial. Initial treatment started with 1.25 mg isradipine twice daily or 12.5 mg captopril twice daily. If normotension was not achieved after four weeks, doses were increased to 2.5 mg twice daily or 25 mg twice daily, respectively. If the maximum dose as monotherapy did not result in normotension, captopril (12.5 mg or, if necessary, 25 mg twice daily) was added to regimens of the isradipine-treated patients or isradipine (1.25 mg or, if necessary, 2.5 mg twice daily) was given in addition to the captopril-treated patients. After 24 weeks of active treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced (P less than .001) with isradipine (from 168 +/- 18 to 144 +/- 14 mm Hg) and with captopril (from 168 +/- 20 to 143 +/- 10 mm Hg). Diastolic blood pressure also fell significantly (P less than .001) in both groups (isradipine: from 105 +/- 5 to 84 +/- 5 mm Hg; captopril; from 105 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 4 mm Hg). With isradipine as monotherapy, diastolic blood pressure was normalized in 49% of patients compared with 56% with captopril as monotherapy (P = NS). Combining both drugs resulted in an increased rate of normalization (to 87%). The results indicate that combined treatment with a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is effective in lowering blood pressure and is well tolerated during long-term therapy. \nCompensatory hypertrophy and adaptation in the cortical collecting duct. The cortical collecting duct (CCD) undergoes hypertrophy and functional adaptation following reduction of renal mass. The nature and mechanisms of these changes have been investigated using microperfusion of isolated CCD from rabbit remnant kidneys. By 1 week after reduction of renal mass, tubule hypertrophy and increased sodium transport are fully developed. The transport adaptations are specific or selective, since bicarbonate transport in these CCD is unchanged. Mineralocorticoids may play an important role in the hypertrophy and increased sodium transport, since plasma aldosterone increases early after reduction of renal mass. Also, adrenalectomy abolishes the changes in size and sodium transport, even with supplementation of aldosterone to unstressed physiologic levels. Epidermal growth factor also has immediate effects on CCD sodium transport; however, the direction of the effect is opposite--an inhibition of transport. \nPerilymph fistula--a diagnostic dilemma. A retrospective series is presented of 51 cases operated on for suspected perilymph fistula. In 26 ears a fistula was identified at surgery. A positive fistula test was found to strongly indicate a perilymph fistula but was more often negative than positive in surgically demonstrated fistula ears. Other vestibular tests were found to be of little value in the pre-operative diagnosis. Ears with a surgically demonstrated fistula and sensorineural hearing loss had either flat or downward-sloping audiograms. Difficulties in diagnosing a perilymph fistula at tympanotomy are discussed. At follow-up, vestibular symptoms were found to be eliminated or improved in 96 per cent of cases with surgically demonstrated fistulae and in 68 per cent of cases in which no fistula was detected at tympanotomy but hearing improved significantly in only one ear (4 per cent) of the former group and in five ears (20 per cent) of the latter group. \nDoes the presence of a measurable blood alcohol level in a potential organ donor affect the outcome of liver transplantation? The widespread application of hepatic transplantation has created a tremendous demand for donor organs. An assessment of donor parameters is thought to be important in selecting good donors; however, the criteria utilized have not been standardized. This study was performed to determine the effect of a measurable donor blood alcohol level on graft survival. Fifty-two patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh were included in the study. Twenty-five patients received liver grafts from donors having a blood alcohol level between 0.04 and 0.4 g/l with a mean of 0.17 g/l. Twenty-seven patients received a liver graft from a donor who had no measurable blood alcohol. There were no differences between these two groups of donors regarding the time of initial hospitalization until the time of donation. Graft failure within the first 30 days was 24% for those receiving an organ from an alcohol-positive donor as compared with 22.2% in those receiving an organ from an alcohol negative donor. The recipient mortality rate was 16% and 11%, respectively. No relationships between the donor blood alcohol level and organ performance, frequency of primary graft nonfunction, or number of episodes of acute cellular rejection were evident. Based upon these data, the presence of a measurable blood alcohol level in a donor should not mitigate against organ donation. \nA novel approach to analysis of transcriptional regulation in human cells: initial application to melanocytes and melanoma cells. An assay system for transcriptional profile analysis of cultured eukaryotic cells has been developed to simultaneously handle multiple samples in a rapid, sensitive, and internally controlled manner. The methodology incorporates a microtiter plate assay system, a rapid cell-harvest enzyme-assay technique, and the bacterial reporter genes beta-glucuronidase and beta-galactosidase. We demonstrate, using beta-actin and SV40 (late) transcription promoting sequences, that this technically refined microtiter-triton-lysate (MTL) assay methodology can readily differentiate between the transcriptional states of human melanocytes before and after pharmacologic stimulation and malignantly transformed versus normal cell environments. Differences in the transcriptional environments are revealed by the relative expression of transcription element probes. The transcriptional activity ratio of the beta-actin compared to the SV40 late transcription promoting sequences was approximately 1:2 in primary cultured melanocytes, 2:1 in 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated melanocytes and 1:4 in the Tang melanoma cell line. Because this MTL assay methodology can accommodate a panel of transcription element probes, we anticipate that the resultant transcriptional profiles will prove useful in deciphering the diverse transcriptional changes that occur within normally regulated and malignantly transformed cells. \nIntestinal manifestations of invasive diarrheas and their diagnosis. Data from studies of 916 children with diarrhea, including 122 from whom shigellae were isolated, and data on patients affected in an epidemic due to Shigella dysenteriae type I were analyzed to determine whether a diagnostic clinical profile of shigellosis could be identified. Blood and/or mucus in stool, increased frequency of stool, abdominal pain, rectal tenesmus, and fever were noted more frequently in patients with shigellosis. The diagnostic confirmation of shigellosis depends on the isolation of the organism, but in the clinical situation early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy can be based on clinical judgment that utilizes local perceptions regarding dysentery. \nHistopathology and immunohistochemistry of the caecum in children with the Trichuris dysentery syndrome. Caecal biopsy specimens from Jamaican children with the Trichuris dysentery syndrome (TDS) and age matched Jamaican controls were investigated by immunohistochemistry and by light microscopy. Biopsy specimens from all children (with TDS and controls) showed a mild to moderate increase in inflammatory cells. Except in the vicinity of the worm, where the epithelium was flattened, there was no other epithelial abnormality. Compared with controls, children with TDS had increased IgM lamina propria plasma cells and decreased intraepithelial T cells. There was also an increase in crypt epithelial cell proliferation. Lamina propria T cells (both activated and non-activated) were no more common in children with the Trichuris syndrome than controls. Epithelial cell HLA-DR and VLA-1 expression (which are increased in other colitides) were the same in both groups. Despite the presence of large worm burdens and chronic dysentery, therefore, only minor changes were seen in the caecal mucosa of children with TDS. \nAnalysis of prognostic factors in men with metastatic prostate cancer. Uro-Oncology Group of Northern Alberta. We determined the influence of the extent of disease on bone scan, serum testosterone, patient age, performance status, method of initial diagnosis, Gleason grade, clinical stage at diagnosis, serum acid phosphatase, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and primary hormonal treatment on survival. The clinical and hormonal data were obtained when the presence of metastatic disease was established and treatment was to be initiated in 162 men with metastatic prostate cancer. Mean followup was 16 months (range 1 to 105 months). A total of 70 men (43.2%) died of the metastatic disease during the evaluation period. Log rank analysis revealed that only serum testosterone (p = 0.035) and extent of disease on bone scan (p = 0.003) significantly affected over-all survival. A trend (p = 0.068) towards decreased survival was observed with increasing values of PSA. Increasing values of acid phosphatase positively correlated with extent of disease on bone scan but was not a significant independent prognostic factor. Patient age, performance status, clinical stage, method of initial diagnosis, Gleason grade and type of hormonal treatment did not significantly influence survival. Upon using multivariate Cox analysis, only extent of disease on bone scan was significantly correlated with over-all survival (p less than 0.014). PSA may also be influential but longer duration of followup will be necessary. We conclude that extent of disease on bone scan is the most important prognosticator of the analyzed factors and that serum testosterone may be of value. \nDifferential effects of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and phorbol myristate acetate on cardiac fibroblasts. Regulation of fibrillar collagen mRNAs and expression of early transcription factors. Cardiac fibroblasts are responsible for synthesis and deposition of fibrillar collagen types I and III. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has been proved to increase collagen biosynthesis in various systems, both in vivo and in vitro. We have investigated the effect of TGF-beta 1 on collagen gene expression in cultured cardiac fibroblasts and have compared this effect with that of a mitogenic agent, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The regulation of collagen types I and III gene expression was examined by using cDNA probes to rat alpha 2 (I) and mouse alpha 1 (III) procollagens. Quiescent cultured cardiac fibroblasts from rabbit heart were treated with TGF-beta 1 (10-15 ng/ml) and PMA (200 ng/ml). After 24 hours of treatment with TGF-beta 1, the abundance of mRNA for pro-alpha 2 (I) and pro-alpha 1 (III) collagens was increased by 112% (p less than 0.001) and 97% (p = 0.05), respectively, in treated fibroblasts compared with untreated cells. However, PMA-treated cells showed an opposite response: a 42% (p = 0.01) decrease in mRNA levels for pro-alpha 2 (I) collagen was observed. Immunofluorescent staining of cardiac fibroblasts in culture with anti-type I collagen antibody showed that alterations in mRNA levels led to altered collagen synthesis: cellular collagen was relatively increased in TGF-beta 1-treated cells and significantly diminished in PMA-treated cells. The abundance of mRNA for pro-alpha 1 (III) collagen was not affected by PMA treatment. \nSkeletal muscle degradation and nitrogen wasting in rats with chronic metabolic acidosis. 1. Chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with impaired growth and negative nitrogen balance, suggesting that it promotes endogenous protein catabolism. 2. Skeletal muscle is the major repository of body protein and is a potential target for stimuli of protein catabolism. 3. This study in vivo examines the effects of chronic metabolic acidosis on the relationship between growth, nitrogen disposal and skeletal muscle catabolism in the rat. 4. Growth, nitrogen utilization and acquisition of body mass were significantly impaired in acidotic animals compared with pair-fed controls. 5. Total nitrogen excretion was significantly increased in acidotic rats despite decreased urea production. The time course of this response to acidosis was synchronous with that of accelerated protein catabolism in skeletal muscle. 6. It is proposed that metabolic acidosis impairs growth by stimulating skeletal muscle protein catabolism. It is suggested that this forms part of a co-ordinated multi-organ homoeostatic response to acidosis, skeletal muscle and down-regulated urea production supplying the nitrogen required for renal ammoniagenesis. \nImprovement of outcome for infants of birth weight under 1000 g. The Victorian Infant Collaborative Study Group. The two year outcome of extremely low birth-weight (ELBW) infants (birth weight 500 to 999 g), born in the state of Victoria over two distinct eras, 1979-80 and 1985-7, were compared. In the 1979-80 era, 25.4% of the ELBW infants survived to 2 years of age; only 12.5% of liveborn ELBW infants survived to 2 years with no neurological disabilities. In the 1979-80 era, ELBW infants born outside the level III centres in the state were significantly disadvantaged in both mortality and neurological morbidity. By 1985-7, the two year survival rate of ELBW infants rose significantly from 25.4% to 37.9%. By 1985-7, the proportion of ELBW infants who survived to 2 years free of neurological disabilities increased from 12.5% to 26.2%. Despite the improved survival, the absolute number of 2 year old children survivors with severe neurological disabilities remained constant at 8/year in both eras. By 1985-7, fewer ELBW infants were born outside the level III centres, their survival rate remained lower, but the severe neurological disability rate in survivors was no longer significantly higher. There has been a concomitant improvement in both survival and reduction in neurological morbidity. \nCT, MRI, and autopsy findings in brain of a patient with MELAS. Brain autopsy findings in a 14-year-old patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes were compared with those of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pathologic examinations revealed extensive laminar necrosis bordered by gliotic tissues throughout the cerebral cortices. Moderate losses of myelin and fibrous gliosis were also observed in the subcortical and deep white matter. These lesions were demonstrated as low-density areas on CT and as high-signal areas on T2-weighted MRI. MRI revealed the lesions more distinctively and precisely than CT. Neither CT nor MRI could reveal abnormalities in the basal ganglia, including vascular proliferation and calcium deposits in the blood vessels. \nEffect of hyaluronic acid on postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion formation and reformation in the rat model. The local application of 0.25% or 0.4% HA before the induction of a measured laser injury on the rat uterine horn was associated with a significant reduction (P less than 0.05) in postoperative IP adhesions when compared with the group of animals pretreated with the diluent vehicle PBS or received no pretreatment. However, 0.4% HA, when applied in a similar manner, was ineffective in reducing reformation of adhesions after microsurgical adhesiolysis. \nGaucher disease: heterologous expression of two alleles associated with neuronopathic phenotypes. To investigate the molecular basis for the distinct neuronopathic phenotypes of Gaucher disease, acid beta-glucosidases expressed from mutant DNAs in Gaucher disease type 2 (acute) and type 3 (subacute) patients were characterized in fibroblasts and with the baculovirus expression system in insect cells. Expression of the mutant DNA encoding a proline-for-leucine substitution at amino acid 444 (L444P) resulted in a catalytically defective, unstable acid beta-glucosidase in either fibroblasts from L444P/L444P homozygotes or in insect cells. This mutation was found to be homoallelic in subacute neuronopathic (type 3) Gaucher disease. In comparison, expression of the mutant cDNA encoding an arginine-for-proline substitution at amino acid 415 (P415R) resulted in an inactive and unstable protein in insect cells. This allele was found only in a type 2 patient with the L444P/P415R genotype. The substantial variation in the type 3 phenotype (L444P homozygotes) suggests the complex nature of the molecular basis of phenotypic variation in Gaucher disease. Yet, the association of neuronopathic phenotypes with alleles producing severely compromised (L444P) or functionally null (P415R) enzymes indicates that the effective level of residual activity at the lysosome is likely to be a major determinant of the severity of Gaucher disease. \nHuman papillomavirus type 16 DNA in ocular and cervical swabs of women with genital tract condylomata. Human papillomavirus type 16 is associated with dysplasias and carcinomas of the conjunctiva and of the uterine cervix. To explore the relationship between cervical and ocular human papillomavirus infection, we examined DNA from bilateral limbal swabs and cervical swabs from 17 women (age range, 17 to 46 years; median, 31.7 years) with biopsy-proven human papillomavirus-related cervical dysplasia who had a normal ocular surface. Using polymerase chain reaction, we identified human papillomavirus 16 DNA in one or both eyes of 13 (76.5%) patients, six (46.2%) of whom had demonstrable human papillomavirus 16 DNA in cervical swabs as well. It thus appears that human papillomavirus 16 is present in the conjunctivae of some patients with human papillomavirus-related genital warts who have no ocular manifestations of infection. Although autoinoculation of conjunctiva may be the source of some ocular human papillomavirus, data suggest that other modes of transmission to the eye also exist. Additional study of the epidemiologic characteristics of ocular human papillomavirus, a widely prevalent virus known to be associated with dysplasias/atypias and cancer, is warranted. \nDeglutition syncope with coexistent carotid sinus hypersensitivity. A 63-year-old man had symptomatic deglutition-induced atrioventricular (A-V) block. There was also a coexistent mixed type carotid sinus hypersensitivity presenting as A-V block. No A-V nodal dysfunction was revealed during electrophysiologic studies. The vasodepressor response to carotid massage implies a central vagal hyperresponsiveness, which can also explain the cardioinhibitory responses to swallowing and carotid sinus massage, both possibly unmasked by posterior myocardial infarction. \nTracking of elevated blood pressure values in adolescent athletes at 1-year follow-up. Resting blood pressures were measured in 467 adolescents during preparticipation physical examinations for high school sports. Fifty-seven of the athletes (12.2%) had significantly elevated blood pressures. Forty-three (79.6%) of 54 subjects demonstrated significantly and persistently elevated blood pressures at 1-year follow-up. A family history of hypertension was positively associated with elevated blood pressures in 46 (80.7%) of 57 subjects compared with controls (23/410 [5.6%]). Consistent with previous studies, subjects with elevated blood pressures had a greater body weight (94.5 +/- 25.7 kg) compared with normotensive subjects (75.2 +/- 14.0 kg). Subjects with elevated blood pressures engaged in heavy resistance weight training (three times a week or more) more often (41/57 [71.9%]) than normotensive subjects (65/410 [15.8%]). These data support the idea that blood pressures measured during routine preparticipation physical examinations for high school sports are a useful tool in screening for elevated blood pressure in adolescents. \nSeminoma of the testis in a patient with 48,XXYY variant of Klinefelter's syndrome. We believe this is the first reported case of seminoma in a patient with the 48,XXYY variant form of Klinefelter's syndrome. Moreover, the seminoma in this patient occurred in a normally descended testis. We report this case because patients with 48,XXYY Klinefelter's syndrome are often confined to institutions, where the diagnosis of testicular tumor may not be recognized as readily. \nFrom chimney sweeps to oncogenes: the quest for the causes of cancer. Over the past 200 years, a bewildering array of chemical, physical, and viral agents has been identified that can cause cancer, but the mechanisms involved are only now becoming clear. In the leukemias and lymphomas, it appears that the activation of cellular oncogenes is important. The genes involved are present in all normal cells and are often associated with cell growth and regulation. When activated, they act in a dominant fashion to cause a cell to express the malignant phenotype. There is increasing evidence that in solid tumors, a more important mechanism may be the loss of a suppressor gene. The classic example is retinoblastoma, in which the retinoblastoma gene has been cloned and is also found to be associated with several other common cancers including sarcomas and small cell lung cancer. It is likely to be one of a family of such genes. It may well be that the activation of one or more oncogenes or the loss of one or more suppressor genes, or both, is required for a tumor to progress from initiation through promotion to a metastasizing malignancy. \nInfluence of changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension on the electroencephalogram and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials during alfentanil/nitrous oxide anesthesia. The effects of variation of arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials (PTN-SCEP) during opioid/N2O anesthesia have not been well documented. We studied the effects of hypocapnia (PaCO2 approximately 23 mmHg) and hypercapnia (PaCO2 approximately 50 mmHg) during steady-state alfentanil/N2O anesthesia in 16 patients. EEG and PTN-SCEP were recorded continuously, while PaCO2 was altered in 15-min intervals by varying the inspired CO2 concentration. Hypocapnia caused significant increases in power in the delta, theta, and beta bands (P less than 0.01), with the greatest increase observed in the alpha band. Relative power increased in the alpha band but remained unchanged in the delta, theta, and beta bands. Median frequency and 95% spectral edge frequency were unaltered during hypocapnia. In contrast, hypercapnia caused a significant decrease of power in the alpha and beta bands, whereas delta and theta power remained unchanged. This was reflected in a significant decrease of the 95% spectral edge frequency, from 8.9 (6.7-11.6) to 7.0 (5.6-8.6) Hz. All EEG parameters returned to normal upon restoration of normocapnia. There was a significant negative correlation between power in the alpha band and end-tidal CO2 in all patients (r = 0.47 to -0.89). PTN-SCEP latencies and amplitudes were not significantly different from control values during hypocapnia and hypercapnia. It is concluded that variations in PaCO2 within the limits 20-50 mmHg produce substantial changes in the EEG power spectrum, especially in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), but do not alter PTN-SCEP. \nGastric antral vascular ectasia: a problem of recognition and diagnosis. Gastric antral vascular ectasia ('water melon stomach') is a poorly documented cause of occult upper gastrointestinal blood loss. We describe a case which emphasises the clinical and pathological difficulties that can be encountered in making this elusive diagnosis. \nA historic case of visual agnosia revisited after 40 years. In one of the seminal works on visual agnosia, Adler (1944, 1950) presented the case of a 22-yr-old woman who sustained carbon monoxide cerebral toxicity in the Cocoanut Grove nightclub diaster of 1942. We located this patient 40 yrs after injury and performed a detailed reevaluation. The patient demonstrated persistent deficits in visual recognition, characterized most prominently by defective recognition of elemental shape and form, associated with alexia, prosopagnosia, visuospatial disorientation and impaired visual imagery. Visual acuity, colour recognition, writing ability and verbal intelligence were relatively preserved. Isolated bilateral occipital injury was demonstrated by CT and MRI scanning. On comparison with previously reported cases, our results support the hypothesis that carbon monoxide toxicity can induce a visual agnosia of the apperceptive type with well defined characteristics, seldom seen with other types of cerebral injury. Prognosis for long-term recovery is poor. \nClinical implications of combined hypogastric and profunda femoral artery occlusion. From 1983 to 1990, nine patients with combined hypogastric (HA) and profunda femoral arterial (PFA) occlusive disease presented with five nonhealing hip disarticulations, three nonhealing above-the-knee amputations, perineal necrosis in six patients, buttock necrosis in four patients, visceral ischemia in two patients, and lumbosacral spinal ischemia in one patient. Obviously some patients had more than one regional complication. Five patients died from complications of HA/PFA ischemia. Survivors included two patients who required a hemipelvectomy, one patient who required an axillary-to-hypogastric artery bypass graft for stump salvage, and one patient who survived despite lumbosacral paralysis and complete cystectomy. The 56% mortality and 100% morbidity emphasize the critical significance of combined hypogastric/profunda femoral artery circulatory compromise. Efforts should be made to preserve or re-establish the HA and/or PFA circulation whenever possible. A hemipelvectomy may be required to allow the wounds to finally heal. Furthermore, the certainty of an above-the-knee amputation healing is not present in these patients; therefore, a hemodynamic assessment of the healing potential of an above-the-knee amputation is required. \nAtrial fibrillation associated with autonomic dysreflexia in patients with tetraplegia. Atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia characterized by disorganized atrial depolarizations and an irregular ventricular response. Most patients with atrial fibrillation have underlying cardiac pathology. This paper presents the cases of three patients with high-level spinal cord injury and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia who developed atrial fibrillation without any cardiac or metabolic disease that would predispose them to this. The paper proposes that autonomic dysreflexia might predispose a patient to atrial fibrillation by altering the pattern of repolarization of the atria, making the heart susceptible to a reentrant type of arrhythmia. High-level spinal cord injured patients may be at increased risk for the development of atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia which, if left untreated, can increase the incidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident that could further impair the patient's functional status. \nDuration of ST segment depression after exercise-induced myocardial ischemia is influenced by body position during recovery but not by type of exercise. To assess whether the duration of ischemic ST segment depression after exercise can be modified by changes in body position during recovery or with different types of exercise, 18 patients with chronic stable angina, positive exercise test results, and documented coronary artery disease were prospectively studied. Every patient underwent testing with three different exercise protocols: (1) Bruce (Bruce-standing recovery), (2) abrupt onset of exercise (abrupt), and (3) modified Bruce protocol preceded by a 10-minute warm-up period (warm-up). After exercise test patients recovered in a sitting position. In addition, all patients performed a fourth exercise (Bruce protocol), but this time they recovered in the supine position (Bruce-supine recovery). Time and heart rate-blood pressure product at 1 mm ST segment depression were similar for Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and Bruce-supine recovery protocols (5.1 +/- 2, 4.4 +/- 2, and 5.2 +/- 2 minutes and 20.8 +/- 4, 21.3 +/- 4, and 20.4 +/- 4 beats/min x mm Hg x 10(-3), respectively. Heart rate and heart rate-blood pressure product at peak exercise did not differ in Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and Bruce-supine recovery. Maximal ST segment depression was -2.0, -1.9, and -2.0 mm with Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and Bruce-supine recovery exercise, respectively, and -1.5 mm with warm-up exercise (p less than 0.05). Duration of ST segment depression into recovery was significantly prolonged after Bruce-supine recovery exercise (9.4 + 5 minutes) compared with Bruce-standing recovery, abrupt, and warm-up protocols (6.8 + 3, 5.9 + 4, and 5.0 + 3 minutes, respectively; p less than 0.05). \nTreatment of experimental suprachoroidal hemorrhage with subconjunctival injection of tissue plasminogen activator: a negative report. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage was created in 10 albino rabbit eyes. Five eyes were treated with subconjunctival injections of 40,000 IU of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) daily for 6 days; five eyes served as controls. It took approximately the same amount of time for the suprachoroidal hemorrhages to clear in both the control and treatment eyes. We conclude that subconjunctival injection of tPA does not accelerate the clearance of suprachoroidal hemorrhage. \nA phase I study of high-dose ifosfamide and escalating doses of carboplatin with autologous bone marrow support. The dose-limiting toxicity in two separate phase I trials of the high-dose single agents ifosfamide and carboplatin was renal insufficiency at 18 g/m2 and hepatic and ototoxicity at 2,400 mg/m2, respectively. In this phase I study, 16 adults were treated with ifosfamide at 75% of the single-agent maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) (12 g/m2) and escalating doses of carboplatin (400 to 1,600 mg/m2) to determine the nonhematologic dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum-tolerated dose of the combination. Both drugs as well as mesna for uroprotection were given by continuous infusion over 4 days with an additional day of mesna (total dose per course, 15 g/m2). Autologous bone marrow support was stipulated for subsequent dose levels once granulocytes remained less than 500/microL for more than 14 days in two of three to five patients entered at a given dose level. Autologous bone marrow support was used at doses above the 400 mg/m2 carboplatin dose level. At the maximum-tolerated dose level of 1,600 mg/m2 of carboplatin, renal toxicity precluded further dose escalation. Of the five patients entered at this dose level, reversible creatinine elevation greater than 2 mg/dL (median peak, 2.6 mg/dL) was observed in three patients, and irreversible renal failure occurred in an additional patient (peak creatinine, 6.9 mg/dL. Transient gross hematuria appeared more common with the combination than with ifosfamide alone. Two patients developed severe somnolence and confusion associated with a rising creatinine. There were two complete (CRs) and four partial responses (PRs) in 14 heavily pretreated assessable patients (including four partial or complete responses in eight assessable patients with advanced refractory sarcoma, and one CR in two patients with germ cell carcinoma). Carboplatin and ifosfamide appear to have overlapping renal toxicity. Nevertheless, carboplatin and ifosfamide can be combined at 80% and 75% of the single-agent maximum-tolerated doses, respectively, with acceptable nonhematologic toxicity. Ifosfamide and carboplatin are an attractive core combination for further studies in the treatment of sarcoma, germ cell, ovarian, and lung carcinomas. \nNew concepts in treatment of chronic persistent asthma. Using a stepwise protocol to control inflammation. Asthma continues to cause unacceptably high rates of disability and death, largely because the severity of disease is underestimated and patients are inadequately educated about their disease. When patients understand what happens during an asthma attack and its aftermath, they are more likely to notice important symptoms and to start or increase self-treatment appropriately. Physicians are responsible for teaching patients how to avoid precipitating factors and for discussing and writing down a self-treatment plan to follow in specific circumstances. The British Thoracic Society has suggested a stepwise protocol for drug treatment of asthma. Each patient must be evaluated individually and started at the appropriate step. \nAllogeneic bone marrow transplantation as therapy for primary induction failure for patients with acute leukemia. The survival of patients with acute leukemia who do not achieve a remission with primary therapy is very poor. High-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been shown to be effective therapy for patients with acute and chronic leukemia. Therefore, we determined the long-term disease-free survival of patients who did not achieve a remission and were then treated with high-dose therapy and bone marrow allografting from matched sibling donors. Twenty-one patients (median age, 28 years) who did not achieve a remission with induction chemotherapy were subsequently treated with allogeneic BMT. After BMT, 90% achieved a complete remission. Six died of complications of the therapy, and six patients relapsed between 27 and 448 days after BMT. Nine patients (43%; median age, 25 years) are alive between 556 and 4,174 days after BMT. The cumulative probability of disease-free survival at 10 years is 43%. This study suggests that allogeneic BMT can be an effective therapy to achieve long-term control of acute leukemia, even in those patients who do not achieve a remission with primary therapy. \nDoes tremor pace repetitive voluntary motor behavior in Parkinson's disease? In patients with Parkinson's disease and in normal subjects, the influence of tremor on repetitive voluntary movement was investigated in the index finger by comparing frequency of isometric force tremor with frequency of voluntary alternating isometric contractions. Tremor frequency, measured over the range from 0 to 70% maximum voluntary force, usually increased with force. The tremor frequency band was lower and more often overlapped with the upper voluntary frequency range in patients than in normal subjects. Normal subjects could accurately produce voluntary contractions at all cue frequencies from 1 to 5 Hz. Patients could produce auditory-paced frequencies of 1 and 2 Hz, but at higher cue frequencies, their voluntary contractions were often faster or slower than the cue. The faster or \"hastened\" voluntary frequencies were within the tremor frequency band, whereas the slowed voluntary frequencies were below it. Maximal voluntary frequency was often greater than the lowest but always less than the highest tremor frequency. It is concluded that parkinsonian tremor may pace voluntary repetitive movements to go faster than intended with the highest tremor frequency being an upper limit for voluntary frequency. Similar mechanisms may underlie the hastened repetitive vocal responses that were also observed in the parkinsonian patients. \nNonhealing leg ulcers: a manifestation of basal cell carcinoma. Seven patients with basal cell carcinomas presenting as nonhealing ulcers are reported. The importance of considering malignancy and taking biopsy specimens of leg ulcers that fail to respond to treatment is emphasized. \nPotassium depletion exacerbates essential hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of potassium depletion on blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, crossover study, with each patient serving as his or her own control. SETTING: Clinical research center at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve patients with hypertension. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were placed on 10-day isocaloric diets providing a daily potassium intake of either 16 mmol or 96 mmol. The intake of sodium (120 mmol/d) and other minerals was kept constant. On day 11 each patient received a 2-litre isotonic saline infusion over 4 hours. MEASUREMENTS: Blood pressure; urinary excretion rates for sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorous; glomerular filtration rate; renal plasma flow; and plasma levels of vasoactive hormones. MAIN RESULTS: With low potassium intake, systolic blood pressure increased (P = 0.01) by 7 mm Hg (95% CI, 3 mm Hg to 11 mm Hg) and diastolic pressure increased (P = 0.04) by 6 mm Hg (CI, 1 mm Hg to 11 mm Hg), whereas plasma potassium concentration decreased (P less than 0.001) by 0.8 mmol/L (CI, 0.4 to 1.0 mmol/L). In response to a 2-litre isotonic saline infusion, the mean arterial pressure increased similarly on both diets but reached higher levels on low potassium intake (115 +/- 2 mm Hg compared with 109 +/- 2 mm Hg, P = 0.03). Potassium depletion was associated with a decrease in sodium excretion (83 +/- 6 mmol/d compared with 110 +/- 5 mmol/d, P less than 0.001). Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentrations also decreased in patients during low potassium intake, but concentrations of arginine vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow were unchanged. Further, low potassium intake increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus and of plasma immunoreactive parathyroid hormone levels. CONCLUSION: Dietary potassium restriction increases blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. Both sodium retention and calcium depletion may contribute to the increase in blood pressure during potassium depletion. \nEffect of inspiratory muscle fatigue on breathing pattern during inspiratory resistive loading. The purpose of this study was to determine whether induction of either inspiratory muscle fatigue (expt 1) or diaphragmatic fatigue (expt 2) would alter the breathing pattern response to large inspiratory resistive loads. In particular, we wondered whether induction of fatigue would result in rapid shallow breathing during inspiratory resistive loading. The breathing pattern during inspiratory resistive loading was measured for 5 min in the absence of fatigue (control) and immediately after induction of either inspiratory muscle fatigue or diaphragmatic fatigue. Data were separately analyzed for the 1st and 5th min of resistive loading to distinguish between immediate and sustained effects. Fatigue was achieved by having the subjects breathe against an inspiratory threshold load while generating a predetermined fraction of either the maximal mouth pressure or maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure until they could no longer reach the target pressure. Compared with control, there were no significant alterations in breathing pattern after induction of fatigue during either the 1st or 5th min of resistive loading, regardless of whether fatigue was induced in the majority of the inspiratory muscles or just in the diaphragm. We conclude that the development of inspiratory muscle fatigue does not alter the breathing pattern response to large inspiratory resistive loads. \nBenign and malignant tumors in patients with acromegaly. Growth hormone and its principal mediator insulinlike growth factor I are known promoters of normal growth. To determine whether excessive secretion of growth hormone is associated with an increased occurrence of benign and of malignant tumors, we studied records of 87 patients with acromegaly seen in the Lahey Clinic Medical Center (Burlington, Mass) from 1957 to 1988 and compared the rate of tumor occurrence with a control group of patients with pituitary tumors (198) and with findings from a cancer registry. Patients with acromegaly had a 2.45-fold increased rate of malignant tumors (95% confidence interval, 0.98 to 5.04) compared with findings from the tumor registry. Female patients had a higher rate than male patients. The rate of carcinoma of the thyroid was excessive and previously underscribed, but the rate of carcinoma of the colon was not increased as reported by others. Among benign lesions, goiters, predominantly nodular, were seen in 25% of patients in addition to a large number of mesenchymal lesions. \nSuperior vena caval obstruction in patients with gut failure receiving home parenteral nutrition. Clinical suspicion and venographic conformation were used to diagnose 15 cases of superior vena caval obstruction (SVCO) in 107 home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patients over 379 cumulative years of HPN (3.9 cases/100 patient-years). Patients with SVCO had been on HPN a mean of 51.5 months and had used 6.2 (range 1-50) central catheters, including short- and long-term, before SVCO was diagnosed. The frequency of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with SVCO was approximately the same as that in our general HPN population. Positive blood cultures were present immediately preceding the diagnosis of SVCO in 40% (six of 15) of cases. Atypical line placements were noted in two cases. The most common management strategies employed were conversion to enteral feedings in five patients and placement of a new catheter directly into the right atrium by thoracotomy in another five patients. Two of the five with right atrial catheters experienced a postpericardiotomy syndrome (fever, pericardial rub, and pulmonary infiltrates) that responded promptly to indomethacin. The most significant long-term sequela of SVCO was the need for a left jugular vein to right atrial appendage bypass in one patient with chronic venous congestion from her SVCO. Once the SVCO is confirmed, systemic heparinization provides immediate antithrombotic effect and minimizes the risk of pulmonary embolism. The use of streptokinase may result in rapid thrombolysis. \nDifferential diagnosis of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas by fine-needle aspiration. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of pancreatic lesions is becoming widespread. Pathologists need to be familiar with the cytologic features of pancreatic tumors, of which cystic neoplasms are a distinct subset. Of our 31 pancreatic aspirates diagnostic of neoplasia, six were diagnosed as cystic by radiographic imaging. These cases were compared. Similar symptoms were experienced by all of these patients, although those with malignant tumors lost the most weight. Loss of border definition, ascites, and liver metastases were the only radiologic clues to malignancy. Each entity had distinguishing cytologic features. These cases illustrate the importance of knowing the clinical, radiologic, and cytologic features of pancreatic cystic neoplasms to arrive at a preoperative diagnosis and determine proper treatment. \nPulmonary dysfunction in advanced liver disease: frequent occurrence of an abnormal diffusing capacity. PURPOSE: Abnormalities in pulmonary function have been reported in association with chronic liver disease of varied etiology. The aim of this study was to better define the frequency and nature of these abnormalities in patients who were being evaluated for liver transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a battery of pulmonary function tests and chest radiographs in 116 consecutive patients (50 men, 66 women; aged 19 to 70 years, mean 44.6 years) with severe advanced liver disease who were hospitalized specifically for evaluation for possible orthotopic liver transplantation and were able to perform technically satisfactory tests. In 17 patients, quantitative whole-body technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin perfusion scanning was also performed for assessment of possible right-to-left shunting through intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. RESULTS: The most commonly affected test of lung function was the single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which was abnormal in 48%, 45%, and 71% of patients who never smoked, former smokers, and current smokers, respectively. Ventilatory restriction was noted in 25% of all patients, airflow obstruction (reduced ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity) in only 3%, and a widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in 45%. Diffusion impairment was accompanied by a restrictive defect in only 35% of the patients and by an abnormally widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in 60%. When diffusion impairment was accompanied by an oxygenation defect, it was also associated with a significantly increased right-to-left shunt fraction (mean 24.9%) assessed from quantitative whole-body perfusion imaging. On the other hand, isolated diffusion impairment unaccompanied by significant hypoxemia (noted in approximately a third of the patients with a reduced DLCO) was not associated with evidence of significant intrapulmonary shunting (mean right-to-left shunt fraction 6.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with advanced liver disease have one or more types of abnormality in lung function, a reduced DLCO being the single most common functional defect. Mechanisms accounting for the abnormality in gas transfer may include intrapulmonary vascular dilatations, diffuse interstitial lung disease, pulmonary vaso-occlusive disease, and/or ventilation-perfusion imbalance. \nMigraine headaches. Once the definitive diagnosis of migraine has been formulated, the physician has many options available for abortive and prophylactic therapy. Nonpharmacologic modalities, including behavioral modification methods such as biofeedback training, may also be considered. Migraine does not necessarily have to disrupt the lives of those afflicted. The patient with mixed headache presents a more difficult diagnostic and therapeutic problem. These patients can also be helped when the disorder is identified, and inpatient therapy for these patients may be required. \nSuccessful treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis with a liposomal amphotericin B preparation. The case of a granulocytopenic patient with acute undifferentiated leukaemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who was refractory to conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B (AmpB) and 5-flucytosine therapy is reported. He experienced severe AmpB-related side-effects, and was subsequently successfully treated with a pharmaceutical preparation of AmpB (5.7 g) entrapped in sonicated liposomes, composed of lecithin, cholesterol and stearylamine in a molar ratio of 4:3:1. Three months later, during maintenance chemotherapy, liposomal AmpB (5.1 g) was reinstituted due to the finding of biopsies positive for Candida albicans at bronchoscopy. After healing of the patient's fungal infection a left upper lobe resection was performed, which showed advanced fibrosis with signs of inflammation, but no evidence of fungal disease. Since no acute side-effects and only moderate hypokalaemia were observed, it appears that liposomal AmpB is superior to conventional AmpB treatment in granulocytopenic patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis and unbearable therapy-related side-effects. \nIncidence of heterotopic ossification after total hip replacement: effect of the type of fixation of the femoral component. The incidence and severity of heterotopic ossification after sixty-five consecutive primary uncemented total hip replacements were compared with those after seventy consecutive primary hybrid total hip replacements (consisting of an uncemented acetabular component and a cemented femoral component). All patients had had the arthroplasty because of osteoarthrosis. The sex distribution, prevalence of bilateral disease of the hip, and frequency of previous operations were similar in both groups. All of the operations were performed by one surgeon who used the same operative approach. Preoperative, immediate postoperative, and six-month follow-up radiographs were reviewed for all patients. For 90 per cent of the hips, radiographs that were made after a minimum follow-up of one year were also reviewed. In the group of patients who had an uncemented femoral component, there was a statistically significant increase in the frequency of heterotopic bone and in its severity. Either none or only class-I ectopic bone developed in 74 per cent of the hips in the hybrid group, compared with 40 per cent of the hips in the uncemented group (p less than 0.005). In contrast, class-III or IV heterotopic ossification was evident in 13 per cent of the hips in the uncemented group (p less than 0.005). None of the patients in the hybrid group needed reoperation for excision of ectopic bone, but four (6 per cent) of the patients in the uncemented group needed such a reoperation because of severe limitation of motion. \nTransduodenal exploration of the common bile duct in patients with nondilated ducts. Exploration of the small common bile duct can be technically difficult and is associated with a significant risk of ductal injury or late stricture, or both. Transduodenal common duct exploration after sphincteroplasty (TCDE/S) is an alternative method of duct exploration that avoids choledochotomy. Cholecystectomy followed by TCDE/S was performed upon 28 patients with nondilated ducts and suspected choledocholithiasis. Common duct stones were retrieved in 17 patients. Failure to retrieve stones in the remaining 11 patients was attributed to either false-positive results of cholangiography, forceful passage of stones into the duodenum during the initial insertion of a Fogarty catheter through the cystic duct or a false-negative finding at duct exploration. There was no perioperative mortality. Two patients had asymptomatic postoperative hyperamylasemia. One patient had postoperative pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinemia and cholangitis that resolved with antibiotic therapy by the eighth postoperative day. Other complications included wound infection, delayed gastric emptying, pneumonia and otitis media. The over-all morbidity rate was 28.6 per cent. Long term follow-up was obtained in all 28 patients. All patients in the follow-up group are free of recurrent biliary tract disease. TCDE/S appears to be a safe and effective method of exploring the nondilated common bile duct. \nMeasurements of regional cerebral blood flow and blood flow velocity in experimental intracranial hypertension: infusion via the cisterna magna in rabbits. Cerebral blood flow velocity, as measured in the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery by transcranial Doppler sonography via the transorbital route, and regional cerebral blood flow and volume in corresponding cortical areas, as measured by the hydrogen clearance technique, were recorded for eight New Zealand White rabbits subjected to infusion via the cisterna magna to elevate intracranial pressure. In the lower range of autoregulation, that is, at perfusion pressures between 80 and 40 mm Hg and even lower, the changes in cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebral blood flow showed a strong correlation (0.86) under conditions of standard pCO2 (PaCO2 = 35 +/- 2 mm Hg). Autoregulation was exhausted at 40 mm Hg, and the cerebrovascular resistance was minimal. Below this perfusion pressure, the cerebral blood flow and volume dropped sharply, whereas the cerebrovascular resistance gradually increased, indicating that, despite the maximally dilated resistance vessels, intracranial hypertension causes vascular resistance to increase, possibly via blocking of the venous outflow. Our results confirmed that noninvasive and easily (even at bedside) applicable measurements of changes in cerebral blood flow velocity could be a substitute for the cumbersome and expensive isotope measurements of cerebral blood flow in patients with intracranial hypertension. \nEndoscopic surgery of the vidian nerve. Preliminary report. The anatomy, surgical technique, and difficulties of endoscopic vidian neurectomy are described. The procedure was carried out on 12 patients: 8 had resistant secretomotor rhinopathy and 4 had recurrent nasal polyposis. This technique is a minor surgical procedure with symptomatic relief and minimal postoperative morbidity. \nImplications for research and policy in the treatment of hypertension. Medical considerations. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a disease and a risk factor. Cardiovascular risk is directly proportional to the level of blood pressure. Current therapeutic approaches include the classical medical model of detection, evaluation, and drug treatment of high-risk patients who have elevated blood pressure and also a less-well-studied population approach that seeks to manipulate environmental variables in large groups of subjects to reduce blood pressure and subsequent cardiovascular risk. Future research should center on more precise delineation of cardiovascular risk, evaluation of alternative environmental manipulations to reduce blood pressure, enhanced understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertension, better matching of antihypertensive drug therapy to pathophysiology, development of new drugs that not only lower blood pressure but also provide additional benefits with minimal side effects, and finally, investigations to further our understanding of the behavioral aspects of the physician-patient encounter, as well as studies on compliance and other issues that influence therapeutic outcome. \nA randomized trial to evaluate the risk of gastrointestinal disease due to consumption of drinking water meeting current microbiological standards. BACKGROUND: This project directly and empirically measured the level of gastrointestinal (GI) illness related to the consumption of tapwater prepared from sewage-contaminated surface waters and meeting current water quality criteria. METHODS: A randomized intervention trial was carried out; 299 eligible households were supplied with domestic water filters (reverse-osmosis) that eliminate microbial and chemical contaminants from their water, and 307 households were left with their usual tapwater without a filter. The GI symptomatology was evaluated by means of a family health diary maintained prospectively by all study families over a 15-month period. RESULTS: The estimated annual incidence of GI illness was 0.76 among tapwater drinkers compared with 0.50 among filtered water drinkers (p less than 0.01). These findings were consistently observed in all population subgroups. CONCLUSION: It is estimated that 35% of the reported GI illnesses among the tapwater drinkers were water-related and preventable. Our results raise questions about the adequacy of current standards of drinking water quality to prevent water-borne endemic gastrointestinal illness. \nNon-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting as a primary tumor of the liver: presentation, diagnosis and outcome in eight patients. We report the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic features of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in eight patients in whom the disease was seen as a primary tumor of the liver. This series illustrates the variety of situations in which lymphoma might be diagnosed: (a) abdominal pain and hepatomegaly (three cases), (b) incidental finding at evaluation of a patient with cirrhosis (two cases), (c) secondary neoplasm after treatment for Hodgkin's disease (one case) and (d) complication of AIDS (two cases). In most cases, clinical and/or radiological features were nonspecific. However, the combination of the following features must be considered as suggestive: occurrence of an apparently primary hepatic tumor in an immunocompromised patient, absence of the usual serum tumor markers and increased serum lactic dehydrogenase activity. The final diagnosis was based on histological examination of specimens obtained by ultrasonically guided liver biopsies or at surgery. All cases belonged to unfavorable histological subtypes. Immunohistochemical findings on paraffin-embedded sections demonstrated the B-lymphocyte lineage of the seven tumors available for study. In the three patients without coexisting disease, complete remission was obtained by surgery alone or combined with chemotherapy. In the two patients with coexisting cirrhosis, outcome was rapidly unfavorable, with death occurring less than 3 mo after diagnosis. Among the three immunocompromised patients, two experienced a rapid unfavorable outcome, and the remaining one was in complete remission after surgery and chemotherapy. In conclusion, primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the liver arising in patients without coexisting disease has a slow progression and might be successfully treated by surgery. \nThe epidemiologic importance of dysentery in communities. This paper explores the epidemiologic importance of dysentery with use of several community studies that demonstrate its prevalence and incidence as well as its association with pathogens, nutritional status, persistent diarrhea, and death. Results of these studies showed that while watery diarrhea was most prevalent in children aged 6-11 months, the prevalence of dysentery peaked between 18 and 23 months of age. Severely stunted children were found to have significantly prolonged episodes of dysentery. Shigella and persistent diarrhea were more frequent in children with dysentery than in those with nonbloody diarrhea. A striking feature was that watery diarrhea, dysentery, persistent diarrhea, and malnutrition each account for less than 5% of all deaths among children aged less than 5 years. However, persistent diarrhea in association with malnutrition causes 13% of deaths in children aged 0-4 years and 27% of deaths in those aged 1-4 years. These data suggest that a more balanced strategy for diarrheal control is required simply because most diarrheal deaths occur among malnourished children with prolonged diarrhea, which is mainly due to dysentery. Results of the studies also suggest that methods to control dysentery in the community should focus on improved hygiene and antimicrobial treatment with use of appropriate algorithms. Recognition of the synergism between dysentery and persistent diarrhea accompanied by malnutrition is crucial in formulating effective programs for control of diarrhea. \nEmbolic abscesses in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherited disorder in which patients may have multiple telangiectases and arteriovenous fistulas in the skin and internal organs. Patients can suffer from a variety of serious clinical complications, including abscess formation. We report two patients in whom neurologic symptoms developed from embolic abscesses, one for whom this complication was fatal. The reported incidence and microbiologic features of this complication are similar to that of endocarditis in patients with valvular heart disease. We believe that patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should receive similar antibacterial prophylaxis for procedures placing them at risk for bacteremia. \nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection The development of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is unusual in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. We present four patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Immunophenotyping of lymph node tissue in three of these patients revealed a predominance of T-suppressor cells. Possible causes for the development of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection are discussed. \nSplenic abscesses due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in patients with AIDS. Among 60 patients with AIDS seen at our institution, two had splenic abscesses due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis without pulmonary tuberculosis. In both cases splenic abscess was the first manifestation of AIDS; the patients had prolonged fever and had lost weight and experienced malaise; slight hepatomegaly was noted in both instances and peripheral lymphadenopathy in one. Chest radiography gave normal results in one case and showed hilar lymphadenopathy in the other. Ultrasonographic findings were characteristic: homogeneous hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, with multiple filling defects of variable size. Diagnosis required splenectomy in one case and biopsy of cervical lymph nodes in the other. In both cases Ziehl-Neelsen staining gave positive results; M. tuberculosis grew from a culture of splenic tissue of one patient and from a culture of lymph nodal tissue of the other. There was a rapid response to antituberculous therapy. Splenic tuberculosis seems to be a distinct extrapulmonary entity in patients with AIDS. Ultrasonographic images are useful for diagnosis and follow-up. \nThe clinical spectrum of hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases. Malignancy-related hypocalcaemia has received less attention in the literature than the opposite perturbation, hypercalcaemia. Only, scarce and contradictory data exist about hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases (BMH). We have reviewed the clinical records of 155 patients with bone metastases of solid tumours, 122 of which were followed during the whole course of the disease until death. The frequency of hypocalcaemia ranged from 5 to 13%, depending on the formula used to correct calcium values for protein concentration. BMH was almost exclusively limited to patients with osteoblastic metastases. The frequency of BMH among patients with prostate carcinoma was 13-27%, depending on the formula used. Only two of 60 patients with lytic bone lesions presented hypocalcaemia, and in both cases it was rather mild. The development of hypocalcaemia did not seem to imply a worse prognosis, at least in patients with carcinoma of the prostate. Thus, the prevalence of BMH appears to be higher than is usually considered. Adequate attention should be given to this disorder because of the potentially deleterious effects on several organ systems. \nThalassaemia trait and myocardial infarction: low infarction incidence in male subjects confirmed. A total of 4401 subjects admitted to the Medical Division of St Camillo Hospital in Comacchio (Ferrara, Italy) over a period of 7 years were prospectively evaluated in order to determine whether the heterozygous beta-thalassaemic (HBT) could be considered as a protective factor against the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Of the total patient sample, 3954 subjects were non beta-thalasaemics (NBTs), and 447 subjects were heterozygous beta-thalassaemics (HBTs). AMI was diagnosed in 384 patients, of whom 17 individuals were HBTs and 367 subjects were NBTs. The prevalence of HBTs in this group was significantly lower than expected (4.43%, P less than 0.0001). Furthermore, an analysis by sex showed that this lower prevalence could be attributed to male patients. Moreover, only in male subjects was a significant negative correlation observed between AMI and HBT. The mean age at which AMI occurred in male HBTs was significantly higher than in male NBTs (72 +/- 2.69 vs. 63 +/- 0.7 years, P less than 0.05), while no differences were found in the mean age at which AMI occurred between HBT and NBT female subjects. This study demonstrates that the thalassaemic trait may afford some protection against the occurrence of AMI in men. \nRegional cerebral blood flow following resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock with hypertonic saline. Influence of a subdural mass. After severe hemorrhage, hypertonic saline restores systemic hemodynamics and decreases intracranial pressure (ICP), but its effects on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) when used for resuscitation of experimental animals with combined shock and intracranial hypertension have not been reported. We compared rCBF changes (by radiolabeled microsphere technique) after resuscitation from hemorrhage with either 0.8 or 7.2% saline in animals with and without a right hemispheric subdural mass. We studied 24 mongrel dogs anesthetized with 0.5% halothane and 60% nitrous oxide. In group 1 (n = 12), hemorrhage reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 45 mmHg for 30 min. In group 2 (n = 12), ICP was increased and maintained constant at 15 mmHg, whereas hemorrhage reduced MAP to 55 mmHg for 30 min (cerebral perfusion pressure [CPP] approximately 40 mmHg in each group). After the 30-min shock period, 6 animals in each group received one of two randomly assigned resuscitation fluids over a 5-min interval: 1) 7.2% hypertonic saline (HS; sodium 1,232 mEq.l-1, volume 6.0 ml.kg-1); or 2) 0.8% isotonic saline (SAL; sodium 137 mEq.l-1, volume 54 ml.kg-1). Once fluid resuscitation began, ICP was permitted to vary independently in both groups. Data were collected at baseline (before subdural balloon inflation in group 2), midway through the shock interval (T15), immediately after fluid infusion (T35), and 60 and 90 min later (T95, T155). In groups 1 and 2, ICP was significantly less in animals resuscitated with HS compared to those receiving SAL (P less than 0.05). \nA randomized clinical trial of alprazolam versus progressive muscle relaxation in cancer patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms. A randomized nonblinded study was performed in three cancer centers to test over a 10-day period the efficacy of (1) a triazolobenzodiazepine, alprazolam, 0.5 mg three times a day and (2) use of a behavioral technique in which patients were trained in progressive muscle relaxation at an initial session with a behavioral psychologist and then asked to listen at home to an audiotape of the session three times a day. Of 147 cancer patients who met entry levels of distress and completed the study, uncontrolled for site or disease stage, 70 were randomized to drug, 77 to relaxation. Four measures of anxiety and depression were used: Covi, Raskin, Affects Balance, and Symptoms Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Results showed that both treatment arms resulted in significant (P less than .001) decrease in observer and patient-reported anxious and depressed mood symptoms. Although both treatment arms were effective, patients receiving the drug showed a slightly more rapid decrease in anxiety and greater reduction of depressive symptoms. These findings confirm efficacy of both alprazolam and relaxation to reduce cancer-related anxiety and depression. As safe, inexpensive, and effective interventions, physicians should consider their use in cancer patients experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms. \nDetection and localization of prolonged epicardial electrograms with 64-lead body surface signal-averaged electrocardiography. BACKGROUND. Prolonged, fractionated ventricular electrograms often are detectable after myocardial infarction and are a marker for an arrhythmia-prone state. QRS late potentials detected on the body surface with signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) are thought to arise from the diseased tissue that generates prolonged ventricular electrograms and as such are also a marker for arrhythmias. A limitation of the current SAECG technique is that recordings are obtained from only three bipolar lead pairs. Because late potentials probably arise from multiple small sources in the heart, more extensive sampling of the body surface may contribute additional information to the SAECG. The present study investigates the additional sensitivity of SAECG using 64 body surface leads in detecting prolonged epicardial electrograms and examines its use in determining the epicardial location of prolonged electrograms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Dogs were studied before and 5-10 days after either lateral left ventricular (n = 13) or right ventricular (n = 8) myocardial infarction. Greater prolongation of signal-averaged QRS duration was detected with 64-lead SAECG (postinfarction QRS duration, 100.3 +/- 16.3 msec) than with three-lead SAECG (postinfarction QRS duration, 89.4 +/- 10.1, p = 0.0005). Nineteen of the 21 dogs (90%) had prolonged epicardial electrograms detected over the infarct. The correlation between epicardial electrogram duration and signal-averaged QRS duration calculated from individual leads was much better for 64-lead SAECG (r = 0.88, p less than 0.0001) than for three-lead SAECG (r = 0.53, p = 0.01), and the difference was most marked in cases with longer electrogram durations (more than 100 msec). Local late potential maxima on the thorax after lateral left ventricular infarction were located to the left and inferior compared with those after right ventricular infarction (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS. SAECG with more extensive recording from the body surface using 64 leads detects greater QRS prolongation than three-lead SAECG, and the longer QRS durations detected correspond to the duration of prolonged epicardial electrograms. Body surface location of late potentials corresponds to the epicardial location of the prolonged electrograms. This application of body surface mapping techniques to SAECG may permit more sensitive detection of arrhythmia-prone states and may aid in identifying arrhythmia sources. \nRole of intraoperative enteroscopy in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding of small bowel origin. Intraoperative enteroscopy was performed in 12 patients (median age 68 years) with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding probably of small bowel origin, six of whom were men. All the patients were evaluated by routine haematological, coagulation and biochemical profiles, upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies, visceral angiography and/or isotope scanning. All the patients were anaemic. Visceral angiography was useful on three of the 12 occasions on which it was used and isotope scanning was valuable on eight of the 11 occasions it was used. Nine patients had undergone previous laparotomy. Enteroscopy was performed successfully in all cases, with fresh blood and discrete vascular lesions being the chief findings (10 of 12 cases). Segmental resections (n = 8) and local resections (n = 2) were performed in ten patients, with two patients having more than one laparotomy for rebleeding. Five patients developed postoperative complications and there was an operative death and one late death. Three of the ten surviving patients experienced further rebleeding. Intraoperative enteroscopy is now an essential adjunct to laparotomy for gastrointestinal bleeding which has been localized to the small bowel before operation. \nPrevention of stroke and brain damage with calcium antagonists in animals. In a rat model of embolic stroke (permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery [MCAO]), various 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have been shown to attenuate brain damage and the resultant functional impairment when administered after MCAO. Dose-response curves reveal that isradipine is one of the most potent and efficacious representatives of this class of compounds, reducing the infarct size by more than 60%. These results suggest that isradipine, when administered shortly after stroke onset, may have beneficial effects in patients suffering from brain ischemia. When isradipine is used to normalize the high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, it will, in addition, also protect the brain from damage engendered by a subsequent stroke. This is not the case if blood pressure is controlled with a calcium antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting that the brain protection seen with isradipine is not due to blood pressure normalization. Isradipine, when used as an antihypertensive, appears to have an additional beneficial effect within the brain itself. As high blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke, such an additional benefit with isradipine would be particularly valuable in antihypertensive therapy. \nA prospective genetic study of complete and partial hydatidiform moles. Two hundred two hydatidiform moles were classified by pathologic features and ploidy into partial or complete moles. Further classification was made by using genetic polymorphism, the diagnosis being refined by deoxyribonucleic acid technology. Among 51 partial hydatidiform moles, 44 triploids, two tetraploids, and one diploid were identified. Informative triploid partial hydatidiform moles had one maternal and two paternal sets of chromosomes, the likely origin being dispermy. Among 149 complete hydatidiform moles, one was haploid, one was triploid, and 105 were shown to be diploid or androgenetic; 39 of these were proved homozygous, indicating duplication of the male genome, whereas heterozygous origin by dispermy was likely in 13. The locus-specific minisatellite deoxyribonucleic acid probes were particularly useful for the identification of heterozygous complete hydatidiform moles. None of the patients with partial hydatidiform moles had development of a gestational trophoblastic tumor. No difference was detected in the frequency of requirement for chemotherapy between patients with homozygous or heterozygous complete hydatidiform moles. \nPharmacokinetics, immune response, and biodistribution of iodine-131-labeled chimeric mouse/human IgG1,k 17-1A monoclonal antibody.
