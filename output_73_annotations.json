        "text": "ormal in 41 (91%) of 45 patients. The symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency subsided in 28 (72%) of 39 patients. These results suggest that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is useful for treating subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion. \nThe growth hormone, prolactin and TSH response to TRH and L-dopa in patients with hyperprolactinaemia and a normal-sized sella turcica may denote a pituitary adenoma. Forty-one patients with hyperprolactinaemia and suspected prolactinomas were studied. Growth hormone (GH) and thyrotropin (TSH) secretory patterns after thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were affected in the majority of patients. The disturbances were observed regardless of tumour size as indicated by the radiological sella size. In patients with hyperprolactinaemia and normal-sized sella turcica, an abnormal GH and TSH response to TRH can be helpful in the diagnosis of a microadenoma. The hyperprolactinaemia per se and its effect on dopaminergic hypothalamic neurones may be the cause of the GH and TSH response. By contrast, many patients with macroprolactinomas showed insufficient GH secretory capacity. \nComplications following ventilation of the middle ear using Goode T tubes. This is a 3.5-year retrospective review on the insertion of 210 Goode T tubes into 182 ears of 93 patients. Otorrhea was noted postoperatively in 35.2% of the ears treated, with chronic drainage lasting longer than 4 months developing in more than 7% of the cases. Perforations were found in 34 ears (18.7%) following removal or extrusion of the T tubes; in 13 (7.1%) of these patients, chronic perforations requiring tympanoplasties developed. The literature was screened for additional studies addressing the complications associated with tympanostomy tubes. The documented incidence of perforations between conventional tubes and Goode T tubes was emphasized, and comparisons were made. Our findings indicate that, even with the immediate placement of paper patches following removal of all Goode T tubes, the percentage of tympanic membrane perforations resulting from the use of Goode T tubes is significantly greater than previously reported. \nGut bacterial translocation via the portal vein: a clinical perspective with major torso trauma. Animal studies implicate gut bacterial translocation via the portal vein as a major factor in the pathogenesis of postinjury multiple organ failure (MOF). We therefore inserted portal vein catheters for sequential blood sampling in the operating room, at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours, and 5 days postoperatively in 20 injured patients (13 blunt, seven penetrating; mean age, 34 years) requiring emergent laparotomy and who were at known risk for MOF. The mean Revised Trauma Score was 6.4 +/- 0.4, and the Injury Severity Score, 29.3 +/- 2.3. Twelve (60%) patients arrived in shock (SBP less than 90 torr). Eight (2%) of 212 portal blood cultures were positive; seven were presumed contaminants. The only positive systemic culture (total, 212) was a Staphylococcus aureus on day 5 in a patient with a concurrent staphyloccal pneumonia. In the first 48 hours, we could not detect endotoxin in portal or systemic blood. Additionally, simultaneous portal and systemic blood levels of complement fragment C3a, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 were nearly identical and, specifically, were not different in those patients who developed MOF. In summary, this prospective clinical study has not confirmed portal or systemic bacteremia within the first 5 days postinjury, despite an eventual 30% incidence of MOF. \nGallbladder function and gastric liquid emptying in achalasia. Because of evidence that the abnormalities in achalasia are not restricted to the distal esophagus, we investigated gallbladder function by cholescintigraphy in the steady state and in response to CCK and the scintigraphic gastric emptying of a liquid caloric meal in 10 individuals with achalasia and 10 normal controls. No abnormalities were found during the filling phase of the gallbladder but seven of the 10 patients showed a 50% reduction in the ejection fraction (39.4% +/- 30.4 vs 80.3 +/- 8.3 of controls, mean +/- SD, P = 0.007) and a slower than normal ejection phase (9.1%/min +/- 6.6 vs 18.1 +/- 4.5, P = 0.02. In eight of the 10 patients, gastric liquid emptying was accelerated with a T1/2 of 41.5 min +/- 15.4 vs 74.7 min +/- 11.5 in the controls (P = 0.007). It is concluded that in some achalasia patients extraesophageal functional abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract may be found. Whether these findings are promoted by degenerative charges of extraesophageal nerve fibers as well as their clinical significance require further investigations. \nDetection of mediastinitis after heart transplantation by gallium-67 scintigraphy. We report the findings of a patient with post-cardiac transplant mediastinitis detected by 67Ga-citrate imaging. Fever and leukocytosis were the first clinical signs suggesting infection. The usual diagnostic modalities, including CT and ultrasound, failed to identify the site of infection. A 67Ga scan showed intense abnormal uptake behind the sternum. The site of uptake was shown by necropsy to be necrotic tissue involving cardiac sutures, pulmonary arteries, and the aorta due to infection with Haemophilus aphrophilus. \nGallbladder and pancreatic metastases from bilateral renal carcinoma presenting with hematobilia and anemia. A case of bilateral metachronous renal cell carcinoma with gallbladder and pancreatic metastases, presenting with hematobilia and anemia is presented. The presentation of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with hematobilia and anemia is previously unreported. This case illustrates (1) the occasionally very long interval between metachronous renal carcinoma; (2) this tumor's propensity to unusual metastases and unpredictable presentation; and (3) the significant palliation which may be achieved by appropriate surgical resection of these metastases. \nUveal melanoma: development of metastases after helium ion irradiation. Forty-two (16%) of 261 patients with ocular melanoma who were treated with helium ions between January 1978 and November 1986 have developed metastatic disease. The time between start of helium ion treatment and recognition of metastatic disease ranged from 3 to 67 months (median, 27 months). The mean pretreatment tumor height in the patients with metastases was 7.7 mm. All 42 patients who developed metastatic disease have died. The median survival after diagnosis of metastatic disease was 5 months; the longest survival was 49 months. The most common site of metastasis was the liver (n = 34). Four (10%) of the 42 patients with metastases also had local recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis identified three variables that predicted independently the development of metastases and lack of survival. These variables are anterior location of tumor (P = .027), tumor height greater than 5 mm (P = .02), and tumor diameter greater than 10 mm (P = .0075). \nAbnormal coronary vasoconstriction as a predictor of restenosis after successful coronary angioplasty in patients with unstable angina pectoris. BACKGROUND. High rates of restenosis after coronary angioplasty have been reported in patients with vasospastic angina. This study was designed to determine whether the occurrence of abnormal coronary vasoconstriction, detected by means of hyperventilation testing before angioplasty, influences the risk of restenosis after successful dilation. METHODS. Hyperventilation testing was performed 0 to 4 days before coronary angioplasty in 106 consecutive patients with unstable angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease. Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was considered present if hyperventilation-induced myocardial ischemia occurred during the recovery phase of the test. All patients had follow-up angiography 8 to 12 months after angioplasty. RESULTS. Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was observed in 48 patients (group 1), whereas 58 patients (group 2) had either a negative response throughout the test or a positive response only during the overbreathing phase of the hyperventilation test. Angioplasty was successful in 40 patients in group 1 and 51 in group 2. Restenosis was documented in 29 patients (73 percent) in group 1 and 13 (25 percent) in group 2 (relative risk of restenosis, 2.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.69 to 4.28; P less than 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the following three characteristics were independently related to the risk of restenosis (in descending order of importance): ST-segment elevation during spontaneous ischemic attacks (P less than 0.001), hyperventilation-induced abnormal coronary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.001), and the presence of a lesion more than 10 mm long in the left anterior descending coronary artery (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. In patients with unstable angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease who have been selected for coronary angioplasty, the presence of hyperventilation-induced abnormal coronary vasoconstriction identifies a subgroup at high risk for restenosis. \nSomatosensory evoked potentials in intracranial hypertension: analysis of the effects of hypoxia. The loss of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP's) was investigated in a feline model of intracranial hypertension. Threshold values of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) required for maintenance of SSEP's are defined using a mathematical model. The model describes loss of amplitude of SSEP's using the form of a dose-response curve. Amplitude of the SSEP's declined to 50% of control values at a CBF of 15 ml/100 gm/min and a CPP of 20 mm Hg in the normoxic animal; in the presence of mild hypoxia (8 to 9 kPa), a significant increase in these values to 18 ml/100 gm/min and 32 mm Hg, respectively, occurred. No reliable changes in latency or central conduction time were demonstrated. It is concluded that given adequate oxygenation, evoked electrical activity is lost at too low a level of CPP for this parameter to be useful in clinical monitoring. However, even mild hypoxia, when combined with intracranial hypertension, produces a major risk to neuronal integrity. \nIntermediate-term effectiveness of balloon valvuloplasty for congenital aortic stenosis. A prospective follow-up study. BACKGROUND. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty has proven to be acutely effective in the treatment of congenital valvar aortic stenosis; however, the intermediate- and long-term effectiveness of the procedure remain to be documented. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the intermediate-term effectiveness of balloon valvuloplasty, repeat catheterization was performed in 27 of 30 children 1.7 +/- 0.1 years after balloon valvuloplasty for congenital aortic stenosis (AS). In 33 children the peak AS gradient was reduced acutely by 55% from 77 +/- 4 to 35 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and left ventricular systolic pressure was reduced from 176 +/- 4 to 138 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Despite a technically adequate valvuloplasty procedure, three patients had inadequate relief of obstruction and required complex surgical intervention. Twenty-seven of the 30 patients available for late reevaluation (90%) enrolled in the follow-up study. The peak AS gradient remained significantly reduced compared with that present before valvuloplasty (29 +/- 3 versus 77 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, there was no difference in peak AS gradient at follow-up compared with that immediately after valvuloplasty. The greatest increase in gradient at reevaluation was 14 mm Hg. Twenty of 27 patients (74%) had no change in the degree of aortic insufficiency at follow-up compared with that present before valvuloplasty. At follow-up, 16 patients had no aortic insufficiency at all, and only two had moderate-to-severe (3-4+) insufficiency. Femoral artery injury was documented in four patients, three of whom were under 12 months of age at valvuloplasty. CONCLUSIONS. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty provides safe and effective intermediate-term gradient relief without early restenosis in children and adolescents with congenital AS. \nA pilot study of fluticasone propionate in untreated coeliac disease. Although gluten withdrawal is likely to remain the mainstay of treatment for adult coeliac disease, many patients find the diet inconvenient and unpalatable and compliance among asymptomatic patients is often poor. Oral corticosteroids have been used for patients who seem to be resistant to gluten withdrawal but preparations with low systemic bioavailability might be preferable. We have given a new glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate) to 12 adults with untreated coeliac disease for six weeks while they were on a normal diet. One patient defaulted and one suffered a relapse in a pre-existing neoplasm. Excluding these, there was an improvement of symptoms, a mean weight gain of 2 kg, and a rise in albumin of 5.4 g/l. There was a significant improvement in the lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio (p less than 0.05) and in all histological variables examined in paired biopsy specimens (surface and crypt intraepithelial lymphocyte/enterocyte and goblet cell/enterocyte ratios and enterocyte height, p less than 0.01 or better). In six paired specimens sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activity increased in all (p less than 0.05) and lactase in five of six. No appreciable side effects were observed, but two patients had suppressed cortisol values and synacthen responses at six weeks. A further three, with normal pretrial results, had a blunted tetracosactrin response at six weeks. Fluticasone propionate seems worthy of further assessment in the treatment of coeliac disease as an adjunct to gluten withdrawal. \nFetal cardiovascular morphology of truncus arteriosus with or without truncal valve insufficiency in the rat. BACKGROUND. Recent advances in fetal echocardiography have necessitated further study on fetal in situ cardiovascular morphology of truncus arteriosus and the effects of truncal valve insufficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 55 fetal rats with truncus arteriosus among 300 fetuses from 40 virgin females treated with 200 mg fertilysin on the 10th day of pregnancy. After rapid whole-body freezing on the 21st day, the fetuses were studied by means of serial cross-sectional photographs of the frozen thorax. Thirty-five fetuses with a normal heart treated with fertilysin served as controls. Truncus arteriosus was characterized by a large ventricular septal defect, a solitary artery (truncus arteriosus) overriding the ventricular septum, the right and left pulmonary arteries originating from the truncus arteriosus with or without a common trunk (main pulmonary artery), and absent ductus arteriosus. Fetuses with truncal valve insufficiency had thick truncal valves, a large truncus arteriosus, and large ventricles. The subgroup of 12 fetuses with a large truncus (truncal diameter greater than 160% of the ascending aorta diameter in the controls) showed significantly greater values for right ventricular volume (200% of control) and mass (120% of control), left ventricular volume (170% of control) and mass (110% of control), right (120% of control) and left (110% of control) atrial volume, and pericardial fluid (140% of control) than the controls. These changes were less prominent and ventricular volumes were not increased in the remaining subgroup with a truncal diameter of 160% or less of aorta diameter in the controls. CONCLUSIONS. In fetal truncus arteriosus, truncal valve insufficiency was associated with increased ventricular volume load and incomplete cardiac compensation in rats. \nMaffucci's syndrome associated with intracranial enchondroma and aneurysm: case report. Maffucci's syndrome is a rare, congenital mesodermal dysplasia combined with dyschondroplasia and hemangiomatosis. Enchondromatous involvement of the skull bones is rare in this syndrome. A rare case of Maffucci's syndrome associated with enchondroma at the skull base, left internal carotid artery aneurysm, and goiter is reported. Two other previously reported cases of Maffucci's syndrome with associated aneurysms and the present case suggest that Maffucci's syndrome may be associated with aneurysm. \nMyotonia and neuromuscular transmission in the mouse. The role of neuromuscular transmission and acetylcholine receptors in the phenotypic expression of hereditary myotonia was reinvestigated in two mutants of the mouse, ADR (adr/adr) and MTO (adrmto/adrmto). Three neuromuscular blockers, curare, flaxedil, and alpha-bungarotoxin, did not prevent mechanical myotonia of EDL and soleus muscles from the two mutants. Furthermore, electrical myotonia was demonstrated in isolated ADR muscle fibers devoid of nerve endings. We conclude that neither release nor reception of acetylcholine are important for the mechanism of myotonia in mouse mutants. The previously described suppression of myotonic aftercontractions by high concentrations of curare (Muscle & Nerve 1987;10:293-298) could not be reproduced; rather, a prolongation of aftercontractions was found. The other drugs had no significant effect on myotonic aftercontractions. Because neuromuscular transmission is not involved in human myotonias, this result supports the use of myotonic mice as a model, at least for recessive generalized myotonia (Becker). \nAccuracy of computer-interpreted electrocardiography in selecting patients for thrombolytic therapy. MITI Project Investigators. A prehospital computer-interpreted electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained in 1,189 patients with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin during an ongoing trial of prehospital thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. Electrocardiograms were performed by paramedics 1.5 +/- 1.2 h after the onset of symptoms. Of 391 patients with evidence of acute myocardial infarction, 202 (52%) were identified as having ST segment elevation (acute injury) by the computer-interpreted ECG compared with 259 (66%) by an electrocardiographer (p less than 0.001). Of 798 patients with chest pain but no infarction, 785 (98%) were appropriately excluded by computer compared with 757 (95%) by an electrocardiographer (p less than 0.001). The positive predictive value of the computer- and physician-interpreted ECG was, respectively, 94% and 86% and the negative predictive value was 81% and 85%. Prehospital screening of possible candidates for thrombolytic therapy with the aid of a computerized ECG is feasible, highly specific and with further enhancement can speed the care of all patients with acute myocardial infarction. \nIn vivo measurements of the fraction of dose of bleomycin labeled with cobalt 57 delivered to human tumors. Concentrations of bleomycin labeled with cobalt 57 (Co-bleo) over time were measured in vivo in 17 patients with 32 sites of lymphoma and 18 patients with lung tumors after administration of the same dose of bleomycin. There were marked variations in individual tumor drug concentrations even among tumors with the same histologic type, indicating that the tumor concentration of this drug in individuals cannot be predicted from the administered dose. Also, tumor concentration could not be predicted from the area under the concentration over time curve (AUC) of Co-bleo in the blood; there was no correlation (r = 0.53) between the AUC and the concentration in the tumor at any point in time between 30 minutes and 8 hours after injection. There was no significant difference in the percent of the injected dose per milliliter (%ID/ml) which was delivered to the tumor when low and high amounts of bleomycin were administered to the same patient. Also, a good correlation (r = 0.88) between the %ID/ml over time was found when injection of low and high doses of bleomycin were compared. The results indicate that using quantitative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and a labeled tracer dose it is possible to predict what fraction of the dose of a chemotherapeutic drug will concentrate in an individual patient's tumor in vivo. They also show that, for bleomycin, escalation of dose will result in a proportional increase of tumor concentration. This increase depends on individual properties of tumors which can be measured quantitatively in vivo by SPECT and are expressed as percent of %ID/ml of tumor tissue. \nMiosis and internal ophthalmoplegia as a manifestation of partial seizures. We present a patient whose only physical manifestation of a partial sensory seizure was bilateral pupillary constriction and internal ophthalmoplegia. The onset and offset of each attack corresponded distinctly with an electroencephalographic discharge of the left temporo-occipital region. We propose involvement of a cortical pupillary constrictive center in the temporal-occipital area. \nNon-Menkes-type copper deficiency with regression, lactic acidosis, and granulocytopenia. A 2-year-old girl with granulocytopenia developed fever followed by truncal ataxia and progressive neurologic regression. CT demonstrated symmetric low-density areas in the cerebral white matter. Sural nerve biopsy revealed axonal degeneration. Blood lactate levels were high, and serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin and urinary excretion of copper were low. Cultured skin fibroblasts showed normal copper uptake. Treatment with oral copper administration normalized serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, blood lactate levels, and granulocyte count. However, copper levels in the CSF were still low, and the patient showed no clinical improvement. We speculated that copper transport across the intestinal wall and across the blood-brain barrier was impaired. \nRisk factors for candidemia in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Between 1983 and 1987 the overall incidence of candidemia at the Institut Gustave Roussy, a tertiary care referral hospital for patients with cancer, increased from 0.1% (7 of 6,801) to 0.32% (24 of 7,515) (P = .009). Because acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was the most common underlying disease in patients with candidemia, risk factors for candidemia were analyzed in this subset of patients. A case-control study comparing the eight ALL patients who had candidemia with 18 ALL control patients revealed that previous bacteremia, prolonged neutropenia, prolonged fever, prolonged administration of antimicrobial agents, treatment with multiple antimicrobial agents, and a relatively high concentration of Candida organisms in stool were significant risk factors for candidemia. In a logistic regression analysis, however, only receipt of vancomycin and/or imipenem was identified as an independent risk factor for candidemia. Further analysis showed that administration of vancomycin promoted proliferation of Candida organisms in the gastrointestinal tract and that this proliferation was associated with an increased risk of candidemia. \nThe effects of alcohol on the female brain: a neuropathological study. This quantitative neuropathological study compared the brains of seventeen alcoholic females with twenty non-alcoholic female controls. There was a significant (P less than 0.001) increase in the pericerebral space value (control 9.5; alcoholic 16.3) indicating shrinkage of the brain. Cerebral grey and white matter volumes were determined morphometrically. There was a significant decrease in the cerebral white matter volume (P less than .02) in the alcoholics. The cerebral grey matter volume was unchanged. These changes parallel those described previously in male alcoholics. Further studies will be necessary to establish the relative severity of the brain damage in males and females. \nPerirenal lipoma versus renal cell carcinoma. Pure renal and perirenal lipomas are rare. They arise from renal cortex, capsule, or perirenal tissue, and may be difficult to distinguish from renal adenocarcinomas. We report on a patient who presented with a renal mass that had the radiologic findings suggestive of a renal cell carcinoma, but proved to be a simple lipoma. \nNatural history of recurrent urinary tract infections in women. To evaluate the natural history of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women, we observed 51 infection-prone women in a standardized fashion for a median of 9 years. During intervals when patients were not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis, infections occurred at an average rate of 2.6 per patient-year, but the rate varied widely from patient to patient (range 0.3-7.6 episodes per year). Seventy-three percent of the observed episodes were symptomatic, with an 18:1 ratio of cystitis to pyelonephritis episodes. Infectious episodes were strikingly clustered, and rates of infection decreased in the winter months. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was highly effective in preventing acute cystitis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and acute pyelonephritis, even when used for as long as 5 years. The proportions of infecting strains resistant in vitro to ampicillin (19%-32%) and nitrofurantoin (5%-18%) were unchanged over the 15-year observation period, while resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increased in the last 5 years of the study. \nEffect of enalapril on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions and congestive heart failure. The SOLVD Investigators BACKGROUND. Patients with congestive heart failure have a high mortality rate and are also hospitalized frequently. We studied the effect of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on mortality and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure and ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.35. METHODS. Patients receiving conventional treatment for heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 1284) or enalapril (n = 1285) at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day in a double-bind trial. Approximately 90 percent of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional classes II and III. The follow-up averaged 41.4 months. RESULTS. There were 510 deaths in the placebo group (39.7 percent), as compared with 452 in the enalapril group (35.2 percent) (reduction in risk, 16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 26 percent; P = 0.0036). Although reductions in mortality were observed in several categories of cardiac deaths, the largest reduction occurred among the deaths attributed to progressive heart failure (251 in the placebo group vs. 209 in the enalapril group; reduction in risk, 22 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 35 percent). There was little apparent effect of treatment on deaths classified as due to arrhythmia without pump failure. Fewer patients died or were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (736 in the placebo group and 613 in the enalapril group; risk reduction, 26 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 18 to 34 percent; P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. The addition of enalapril to conventional therapy significantly reduced mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and reduced ejection fractions. \nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the elderly: early and long-term results. The immediate and long-term efficacy of coronary angioplasty in the elderly was determined by studying 752 patients greater than or equal to 65 years old and comparing patients greater than or equal to 75 years old with those 65 to 74 years old. The oldest patients were more highly symptomatic, were more likely to be in heart failure, had more multivessel disease and were more likely to undergo multivessel dilation. The immediate success rate of angioplasty was higher in the oldest patients (92.8% versus 82%) (p = 0.0003). The hospital mortality rate was also higher (6.2% versus 1.6%) (p less than 0.001). Long-term overall survival was high. However, long-term event-free survival was lowest in the oldest patients, and recurrent severe angina was particularly common. Thus, in very elderly patients, coronary angioplasty is usually successful, but extra caution is warranted; also, long-term relief from angina is less common than in younger patients. \nPatients with a high defibrillation threshold: clinical characteristics, management, and outcome. Of 125 patients prepared to receive implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) with the patch-patch configuration of the difibrillating electrodes, 23 (18%) had high (greater than or equal to 25 joules) defibrillation thresholds (DFTs). These patients had lower left ventricular ejection fractions (27 +/- 12 vs 34 +/- 13; p less than 0.03) and a higher incidence of previous heart surgery (47% vs 19%; p less than 0.01) than patients with normal DFTs but did not differ in age, type of heart disease, incidence of concomitant heart surgery, or use of antiarrhythmic medication. Defibrillators were implanted in 18 of these 23 patients, 12 during the initial surgery and six after repeat DFT testing 2 weeks later. After 22 +/- 11 months of follow-up, four patients with ICDs died (two suddenly, and two of nonsudden cardiac causes). Two patients without ICDs died of nonsudden cardiac causes. Appropriate shocks were received by five patients (29%) including both who died suddenly later. A high DFT may be more common than previously stated. It is associated with poor ventricular function and previous heart surgery. Repeated DFT testing may be useful in some patients. A high DFT does not preclude successful ICD shocks, but other therapies may provide better results. \nCalcium oxalate microcalcifications in the breast. Calcium oxalate calcifications can be difficult to detect with routine histologic procedures. In the reported case, microcalcifications that were evident with radiography of the specimen and of the paraffin blocks could not be detected with light microscopy. Polarized light microscopy, however, revealed the calcifications to be calcium oxalate crystals. Use of polarized light microscopy may resolve radiologic-pathologic discrepancies in such cases. \nEffect of a new monoclonal antibody, TA-2, that inhibits lymphocyte adherence to cytokine stimulated endothelium in the rat. An important event in the migration of lymphocytes out of the blood is their adherence to endothelial cells (EC). In inflammatory sites cytokines activate EC and promote lymphocyte EC adherence and migration. Small peritoneal exudate lymphocytes (sPEL) preferentially migrate from the blood to cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and to sites injected with IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha/beta, and TNF-alpha, rather than to peripheral lymph nodes. The basis of this migration is sPEL adherence to cytokine-activated EC. To study this adhesion mAb to rat sPEL were screened for inhibition of sPEL adherence to IFN-gamma-stimulated EC. One mAb, TA-2, inhibited IFN-gamma-stimulated adherence to EC by 60%. This antibody had no effect on the baseline adherence of sPEL to unstimulated EC. Treatment of sPEL, but not EC, with TA-2-inhibited adhesion. TA-2 also inhibited adhesion to EC activated with mIL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS, and the adhesion of spleen T cells to activated EC. The TA-2 Ag was expressed on virtually all lymph node, spleen, and sPEL lymphocytes but sPEL expressed two to three times higher levels than lymph node lymphocytes, and the highest levels were found on CD4+ and CD45R- memory T cells. TA-2 immunoprecipitated a group of four polypeptides with molecular mass of 150, 130, 83, and 66 kDa. Finally, TA-2 inhibited sPEL adhesion to TNF-alpha and IL-1 stimulated human umbilical vein EC to the same extent as an anti-human VCAM-1 mAb, and combinations of TA-2 and anti-VCAM-1 were not different from treatment with either antibody alone. Thus, TA-2 appears to recognize rat VLA-4 based on immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and lymphocyte EC studies. VLA-4 mediates the adhesion of rat lymphocytes to rat microvascular EC stimulated with IFN-gamma, mIL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS. VLA-4 is important in the increased adhesion of sPEL to EC and the enhanced sPEL migration to inflammation may in part be explained by increased expression of VLA-4 on these cells. \nThe significance of circulating cells carrying t(14;18) in long remission from follicular lymphoma Peripheral blood mononuclear cell fractions from 15 patients in continuous clinical remission from follicular lymphoma for longer than 10 years were examined for cells carrying the t(14;18) translocation using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The assay used was able to detect one positive cell in approximately 5 x 10(5) cells (a single 14q+ molecule in 2.5 micrograms DNA). Cells positive for t(14;18) were found in six of eight patients initially presenting with stage III or IV disease, compared with zero of seven of those with stage I or II disease (P less than .05). In two cases 14q+ junction regions were also successfully amplified from formalin-fixed biopsy material obtained at presentation 12 and 17 years previously. In both, sequence analysis demonstrated that the cells circulating in remission belonged to the original clone. These results indicate that cells bearing t(14;18) frequently persist in the peripheral blood in long remission of advanced follicular lymphoma and question the value of their presence as a predictor of relapse. \nPrevention of adult heart disease beginning in childhood: intervention programs. Multiple strategies are available to affect children's cardiovascular health. From clinic-based high-risk counseling to broad-based school or community programs, intervention strategies are being developed and tested to find the most effective means of changing the risk factors of youth to assure a healthier future for our children. Since adoption of new behaviors is improved by consistent messages from multiple sources, a concerted effort is needed. The involvement of health professionals, educators, community organizations, industry, and government together will be important to support the adoption of healthy lifestyles for succeeding generations. Intervention through cardiovascular health promotion for school children may well be the future direction for preventive cardiology. \nA new surgical classification system for shoulder-girdle resections. Analysis of 38 patients. A new, six-stage surgical classification system is described for shoulder-girdle resections for patients being treated by limb-sparing procedures for bone and soft-tissue tumors. The classification is based upon current concepts of oncological surgery, the structures removed, the type of resection performed, and the relationship of the resection to the glenohumeral joint, and it indicates the increasing surgical magnitude of the procedure. Data from 38 patients with an average follow-up period of 4.6 years (range, two to 8.4 years) were analyzed. Thirty-two tumors were in bone and six in soft tissue. Eighty-seven percent (33 of the 38 tumors) were malignant. Twenty-four lesions were located in the proximal humerus and 14 in the scapula. The system permitted classification of all shoulder girdle resections done in this study's institutions. The classification is proposed as a means of establishing a uniform terminology in the comparison of such data. \nAntibiotic prophylaxis of wound infections in skin surgery A controlled prospective study of 2165 outpatients undergoing skin surgery was performed to evaluate the utility and the effects of several antibiotic schedules for prophylaxis of wound infections. The patients were divided into four groups. Twenty-three of the 541 group A patients, given no antibiotics, had wound infections. Eight of the 542 group B patients, given systemic antibiotics from immediately after surgery until the third day, had wound infections. Four of the 540 group C patients, treated only with local sterile antibiotic powder sprinkled into the wound during surgery, had wound infections develop, and only one infection occurred in the 542 group D patients given systemic antibiotics from 2 days before surgery until the second day after surgery. This last schedule was the best for prophylaxis of wound infections in contamination-prone regions. Local antibiotic administration is a simple method for prevention of infections in routine skin surgery. \nCoexistent hemangioblastoma and arteriovenous malformation of the cerebellum. Case report. A case of cerebellar hemangioblastoma and coexistent arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is presented. Angiography displayed the AVM, but histological examination revealed a coexisting hemangioblastoma. Various theories concerning the etiology of this condition are discussed. \nPET study of carbon-11-PK 11195 binding to peripheral type benzodiazepine sites in glioblastoma: a case report. The utility of the peripheral type benzodiazepine site ligand 11C-PK 11195, for imaging human glioma in conjunction with Positron Emission Tomography, relies on a high specific binding of the tracer to tumoral peripheral type benzodiazepines sites. In a patient with glioblastoma, we found that 11C-PK 11195 binding was two-fold higher in the tumor than in normal gray matter and that 30% of tumoral binding could be displaced by a large excess of unlabeled drug. These findings suggest that tumoral retention of the ligand is due, in part, to specific binding. \nMyocardial lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzyme activities in transplanted human hearts. Lactate dehydrogenase and its heart (H) and muscle (M) subunit activities were studied in right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from eight transplanted human hearts and compared with five chronically failing hearts and six normal human hearts from brain-dead liver/kidney donors. Of the 17 transplant biopsies (taken 5-95 weeks postoperatively), only two showed histologic signs of chronic rejection: They were excluded from the group analysis. A higher proportion of the M subunit of lactate dehydrogenase (M%) was found in the transplanted and the chronically failing hearts than in the normal hearts, presumably reflecting increased myocardial anaerobic glycolytic stress. In the early post-transplantation period, M% was higher in the transplanted than in the chronically failing hearts. Thereafter M% gradually fell, but had not reached normal levels 1-2 years after transplantation. During that time it was similar to the values in the chronic-failure hearts. In the two biopsies with chronic rejection, M% was nearly twice as high as in contemporaneous biopsies showing mild or no rejection. Monitoring of enzymatic adaptation from endomyocardial biopsies may be of clinical interest. \nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure in patients with achalasia. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is believed to be an inhibitory neurotransmitter responsible for lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. In patients with achalasia the concentration of VIP and the number of VIP-containing nerve fibers are reduced or absent. It has been suggested that the response to low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may be mediated by a nonadrenergic noncholinergic pathway in which the release of VIP is responsible for the smooth muscle relaxation. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of TENS on LES pressure and on VIP plasma concentrations in six patients with achalasia (five female, one male). TENS was performed daily during one week for 45-min sessions with a pocket stimulator that delivered low-frequency pulses (6.5 Hz), at 10 pulses/sec of 0.1-msec duration at intensities of 10-20 mA until rhythmic flexion of the fingers was obtained without producing pain. LES pressure and VIP levels were obtained before TENS, after the first 45-min session, and after a week of daily stimulation. After 45-min, TENS produced a significant reduction (P less than 0.01) in LES resting pressure from the mean value 56 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 42.3 +/- 6.4 mm Hg; with LES relaxation improvement from 50.6 +/- 3% to 63.1 +/- 3.2% (P less than 0.01). After one week of daily TENS, an additional reduction in LES resting pressure (40.3 +/- 4 mm Hg) was observed (P less than 0.01). \nEpibulbar choristoma and microphthalmia: a report of two cases. The simultaneous ipsilateral presence of an epibulbar choristoma and microphthalmia has rarely been reported. We present two such cases, one of which is associated with bone formation, and we consider a possible pathogenetic mechanism. \nInflammatory pseudotumor of the choroid plexus in Sjogren's disease. We report an unusual case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the choroid plexus of the right lateral ventricle, manifesting as an intraventricular mass and causing unilateral hydrocephalus in a 48-year-old man who suffered from Sjogren's disease and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The lesion obliterated the normal choroidal architecture by a mixed chronic inflammatory process that was associated with reactive connective tissue changes. Immunohistochemical studies showed no light-chain restriction in the cells, and residual islands of transthyretin-positive epithelial cells were identified, implicating the choroid plexus origin of the mass. \nAn economic evaluation of lovastatin for cholesterol lowering and coronary artery disease reduction. The costs and benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) were considered using lifetime lovastatin therapy as the intervention model for adults between 35 and 55 years of age. The analysis projected the benefits of CAD risk reduction using estimates from the Framingham Heart Study. The chosen analytic perspective was that of the patient. For average-risk men with total serum cholesterol levels between 5.69 and 9.83 mmol/liter (220 and 380 mg/dl), the cost per life-year saved ranged from $9,000 to $106,000, whereas for average-risk women, the cost ranged from $35,000 to $297,000 (1989 U.S. dollars). In high-risk men (with smoking habit and hypertension), the cost per life-year saved values ranged from 6,000 to $53,000, whereas in high-risk women the cost per life-year saved values ranged from $19,000 to $160,000. The results were more favorable than those found in previous studies of alternate medication therapies for hypercholesterolemia. Even using conservative parameter assumptions, at least 800,000 Americans aged 35 to 55 years are at sufficiently high risk for CAD, so that the net cost of lovastatin therapy can be favorably compared with other widely used medical interventions. \nEffect of age on use of thrombolytic therapy and mortality in acute myocardial infarction. The MITI Project Group. The findings in 3,256 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction were tabulated to assess the history, treatments and outcome in the elderly; 1,848 patients (56%) were greater than 65 years of age, including 28% who were aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The incidence of prior angina, hypertension and heart failure (only 3% of patients less than 55 years of age had a history of heart failure compared with 24% greater than or equal to 75 years old) was found to increase with age. Twenty-nine percent of patients less than 75 years of age were treated with a systemic thrombolytic drug compared with only 5% of patients older than 75 years. Mortality rates increased strikingly with advanced age (less than 2% in patients less than or equal to 55, 4.6% in those 55 to 64, 12.3% in those 65 to 74 and 17.8% in those greater than or equal to 75 years). Both the incidence of complicating illness and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) increased with age. In a multivariate analysis of outcome in older patients (greater than or equal to 65 years), adverse events were related to both prior history of heart failure (odds ratio 3.9) and increasing age (odds ratio 1.4 per each decade of age). Outcome was not improved by treatment with thrombolytic drugs, but these agents were prescribed to only 12% of patients greater than 65 years of age, thereby reducing the power for detecting such an effect. \nResection of intrinsic tumors from nondominant face motor cortex using stimulation mapping: report of two cases. We report two right-handed patients who underwent resection of intrinsic glial tumors from the nondominant hemisphere, face motor cortex. Both patients underwent preoperative assessment with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging localizing the tumor in the inferior region of the Rolandic cortex. With the patients under general anesthesia and without muscular paralysis, the tumor volume was determined by intraoperative ultrasound and resective surgery accomplished with the aid of cortical and subcortical stimulation mapping techniques. Radical resection of the tumor from the face motor cortex was achieved in both patients. A transient contralateral facial weakness and apraxia were noted in each patient, and this resolved within 6 to 8 weeks following surgery. Removal of intrinsic tumors involving the nondominant face motor cortex may be safely achieved using brain mapping techniques to localize inferior Rolandic cortex and avoid resection of the hand motor cortex and descending subcortical motor pathways. Permanent disability will be prevented due to the bilateral representation of face motor function at the neocortical level. However, due to language localization in cortical zones contiguous with the dominant hemisphere, face motor cortex, we do not recommend resection of this region. \nTransfusion-related chronic liver disease in sickle cell anemia. The medical records and liver biopsies of nine sickle cell patients with chronically elevated liver function tests were retrospectively reviewed to determine the etiology of chronic liver disease. There were eight women and one man with a mean age of 30 yr. All patients had hemoglobin SS. Eight patients were referred for elevated aminotransferases and one for an elevated alkaline phosphatase. Hemosiderosis was present in all of the biopsies. Two patients had cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis was noted in two patients, and five patients had cholestasis. Two patients had serologic markers demonstrating HBV exposure but no patients were HBsAg positive. Erythrophagocytosis, sinusoidal dilatation, and Kupffer cell hyperplasia were present in all of the liver biopsies. Transfusion-related causes were the most common significant pathologic findings in our patients, and appeared to be the etiologies of chronic liver disease in sickle cell patients. \nSinus bradycardia related to temporomandibular joint surgery. The carotid artery lies in close relationship to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Manipulation of the mandible during TMJ surgery has been observed in several cases to be directly associated with the development of sinus bradycardia as the joint is distracted during arthrotomy and arthroplasty procedures. We report several cases and discuss differential diagnosis of sinus bradycardia associated with positional changes of the TMJ. This report emphasizes the importance to the surgeon and to the anesthesiologist of recognition of this cardiac phenomenon, mediated through the trigeminovagal reflex, to appropriately manage the patients during TMJ surgery. \nResection of the inferior vena cava or intraluminal vena caval tumor thrombectomy during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic germ cell cancer: indications and results. A total of 42 patients underwent inferior vena caval resection (40) or intraluminal tumor thrombectomy (2) during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for bulky abdominal metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell cancer (7% of all post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection cases). The 3 indications for vena caval resection included tumor clearance (38%), vena caval scar occlusion (14%) and vena caval tumor thrombus (48%). En bloc vena caval resection to achieve tumor clearance was justified by subsequent nodal pathology (cancer in 63% of the specimens and teratoma in 31%). Vena caval resection in the presence of scar occlusion was de facto required by virtue of its incorporation in the specimen. Vena caval resection or thrombectomy is indicated for intraluminal tumor thrombus because thrombus pathology (cancer 35%, teratoma 45% and fibrosis 20%) reflected nodal pathology in 71% of the patients with cancer, 78% with teratoma and 100% with fibrosis. The complications of vena caval resection were generally transitory. The 71% survival rate justifies this intensive surgical approach because these patients had exhausted all chemotherapy options. \nEffects of embolus size on hemodynamics and gas exchange in canine embolic pulmonary hypertension. We examined the effects of different-sized glass-bead embolization on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange in 12 intact anesthetized dogs. Pulmonary hemodynamics were evaluated by multipoint pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa)/cardiac output (Q) plots before and 60 min after sufficient amounts of 100-microns (n = 6 dogs) or 1,000-microns (n = 6 dogs) glass beads to triple baseline Ppa were given and again 20 min after 5 mg/kg hydralazine in all the animals. Gas exchange was assessed using the multiple inert gas elimination technique in each of these experimental conditions. Embolization increased both the extrapolated pressure intercepts (by 6 mmHg) and the slopes (by 5 mmHg.l-1.min.m2) of the linear Ppa/Q plots, together with an 80% angiographic pulmonary vascular obstruction. These changes were not significantly different in the two subgroups of dogs. However, arterial PO2 was most decreased after the 100-microns beads, and arterial PCO2 was most increased after the 1,000-microns beads. Both bead sizes deteriorated the distribution of ventilation (VA)/perfusion (Q) ratios, with development of lung units with higher as well as with lower than normal VA/Q. Only 100-microns beads generated a shunt. Only 1,000-microns beads generated a high VA/Q mode and increased inert gas dead space. Hydralazine increased the shunt and decreased the slope of the Ppa/Q plots after 100-microns beads and had no effect after 1,000-microns beads. We conclude that in embolic pulmonary hypertension, Ppa/Q characteristics are unaffected by embolus size up to 1,000 microns. \nAnterograde amnesia with fornix damage following removal of IIIrd ventricle colloid cyst. Two patients developed anterograde amnesia following the apparently uncomplicated transcallosal-transventricular removal of a colloid cyst. Damage to the fornical columns was demonstrated on CT and MRI scans, whilst other memory related structures were entirely normal. Longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation, over 12-24 months, has revealed a very similar pattern of deficit in the two cases: verbal memory has remained persistently impaired whilst nonverbal anterograde memory has improved to some degree. Formal tests of remote public (famous faces and events) and personal autobiographical memory have supported the clinical impression that neither patient has a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. These findings address the role of the fornix, and the dissociation of memory processes in humans. \nHypertension in blacks: clinical overview. Although the decline in stroke and other cardiovascular morbid and mortal events has been occurring since the 1940s, the steeper decline since 1968 has been attributed to improved hypertension awareness, treatment, and control. However, in spite of this encouraging trend from the population in general, surveys from the 1970s and our more recent survey from the Maryland Hypertension Program indicate that hypertension control among blacks remains unacceptably poor, particularly in view of the high prevalence. Of special concern are black men, who have the highest prevalence of any group and the poorest control rate (see Tables 6-1 through 6-4). According to Gillum and Gillum, \"High rates of non-compliance with follow-up and drug therapy seriously compromised the efforts of community-wide programs. Indeed, non-compliance with therapeutic or preventive health advice is now the major barrier to effective hypertension control in the United States.\" Impediments to ideal hypertension control in black communities can be divided into three categories 1. Severity of hypertension in blacks. 2. Barriers related to the medical care system, including inadequate financial resources (see also Chapter 5), inconveniently located health care facilities, long waiting times, and inaccessibility to health education, specifically as it relates to hypertension. 3. Barriers related to the social, psychosocial, and sociopolitical environment, which include problems of underemployment, unemployment, racism, and strained racial relationships. In summary, one could say that, in spite of generally improved hypertension control in the United States, the group that has the worse problems (blacks, especially males) is not benefiting as much as the general population. The strategy for treating black patients with hypertension is little different from that applied to all other patients. However, consideration must be given to the patients' lifestyle. The cultural differences in diet especially must be taken into account. Finally, economic considerations must always be an important component in managing black hypertensive patients. For a detailed discussion of treatment alternatives, see Chapter 11. \nIncrease in atherosclerosis and adventitial mast cells in cocaine abusers: an alternative mechanism of cocaine-associated coronary vasospasm and thrombosis. Coronary vasospasm has been implicated as a cause of myocardial ischemia and sudden cardiac death in cocaine abusers. However, the mechanism or mechanisms remain unknown. Autopsy records (n = 5,871) from the medical examiner's files at Baltimore, Maryland and northern Virginia were examined and 495 persons (8.4%) were identified with positive toxicologic findings for cocaine. Of these, six subjects (1.2%) had total thrombotic occlusion, involving primarily the left anterior descending coronary artery. The mean number of adventitial mast cells per coronary segment and the degree of atherosclerosis were determined. These observations were compared with findings in age- and gender-matched subjects who died from cocaine overdose and in patients who had sudden cardiac death (acute thrombosis) without a history of illicit drug abuse. There were significantly more mast cells in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis than in the other groups. The number of mast cells showed a significant correlation with the degree of cross-sectional luminal narrowing (r = 0.68) in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis but not in subjects with sudden death due to thrombosis (r = 0.34, p less than 0.03). Subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis also had significant coronary atherosclerosis without plaque hemorrhage (five had one or more vessels with greater than 75% cross-sectional area luminal narrowing) despite a mean age of 29 +/- 2 years. These findings suggest that adventitial mast cells may potentiate atherosclerosis and vasospasm, thrombosis and premature sudden death in long-term cocaine abusers. \nTransesophageal Doppler echocardiography of pulmonary venous flow: a new marker of mitral regurgitation severity. Pulmonary venous flow varies with different cardiac conditions. Flow patterns in response to mitral regurgitation have not been well studied, but flows may vary enough to differentiate among different grades of regurgitation. Accordingly, pulmonary venous flow velocities were recorded in 50 consecutive patients referred for outpatient (n = 26) or intraoperative (mitral valve repair; n = 24) echocardiographic examination for mitral regurgitation. Recordings were made of right and left upper pulmonary veins with pulsed wave Doppler transesophageal echocardiography. Mitral regurgitation was graded from 1+ to 4+ by an independent observer using transesophageal color flow mapping. The results of cardiac catheterization performed 5 weeks earlier in 43 of the patients were also graded for mitral regurgitation by an independent observer. Pulmonary venous flow patterns, the presence of reversed systolic flow and peak systolic and diastolic flow velocities were compared with the severity of mitral regurgitation indicated by each technique. Of the 28 patients with 4+ regurgitation by transesophageal color flow mapping, 26 (93%) had reversed systolic flow. The sensitivity of reversed systolic flow in detecting 4+ mitral regurgitation by transesophageal color flow mapping was 93% and the specificity was 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of reversed systolic flow in detecting 4+ mitral regurgitation by cardiac catheterization were 86% and 81%, respectively. Discordant flows were observed in 9 (24%) of 38 patients; the left vein usually showed blunted systolic flow and the right showed reversed systolic flow. In 22 intraoperative patients, there was \"normalization\" of pulmonary venous systolic flow after mitral valve repair in the postcardiopulmonary bypass study compared with the prebypass study after the mitral regurgitant leak was corrected. \nExcision of exposed cartilage for management of Mohs surgery defects of the ear. Cartilage of the ear is often exposed during Mohs surgical procedures. Fenestration of the cartilage with a skin punch has been recommended to stimulate granulation tissue where the perichondrium has been destroyed. This article describes an alternative method--the excision of a window through the exposed cartilage, fully exposing the perichondrium on the other side of the cartilage. This promotes the rapid healing by second intention or provides a vascular bed for immediate skin grafting. Also, aggressive excision of nonviable cartilage helps prevent chondritis or perichondritis. \nPrognostic significance of a predischarge exercise test in risk stratification after unstable angina pectoris The prognostic significance of exercise testing was compared with clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) variables in a prospective study of 107 patients with unstable angina discharged from the hospital on medical therapy. During a follow-up period of 12.8 +/- 1.4 months, 10 patients (9%) had a nonfatal myocardial infarction (n = 8) or died (n = 2) and 22 (20%) were readmitted with recurrent unstable angina. The relation between 20 clinical, ECG and exercise test variables and the risk of adverse outcome (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or recurrent unstable angina) was analyzed using both univariate and multivariate (logistic regression) analysis. Univariate predictors of adverse outcome included diabetes mellitus, evolutionary T wave changes, T wave changes on the preexercise ECG and low maximal rate-pressure product during exercise. Independent predictors of adverse outcome in multivariate analysis included diabetes mellitus, evolutionary T wave changes after admission, rest pain during hospitalization, ST depression during exercise and low maximal rate-pressure product. A predictive model constructed using the regression equation and all independent predictors stratified patients into high and low risk groups (41% and 5% risk of adverse outcome, respectively). The result of a predischarge exercise test adds independent prognostic information to clinical and ECG data in medically treated patients with unstable angina and could be used in combination with clinical and ECG data to identify patients at risk of adverse events. \nThe glucocorticoid hormone signal transduction pathway in mice homozygous for chromosomal deletions causing failure of cell type-specific inducible gene expression. Wild-type newborn mice are characterized by the ability of certain liver-specific genes encoding various enzymes and mapping on different chromosomes to respond to glucocorticoid induction. Newborn mice homozygous for deletions at and around the albino locus on chromosome 7 fail to develop this competence for hormone-inducible gene expression even through they do show normal constitutive expression of the same genes. Studies of the glucocorticoid hormone signal transduction pathway reported here show identical expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein in deletion homozygotes and normal littermates. Furthermore, the receptor interacts normally with the 90-kDa heat shock protein hsp90. Elevated glucocorticoid hormone levels in newborn deletion homozygotes, most likely resulting from their stressed condition, provide an explanation for the reduced binding activities of receptors reported previously. The elimination of receptors and hormones as direct targets of the chromosomal deletion effects suggests that the failure of inducible gene expression might reside in defective competence of the affected structural genes to respond to the hormonal stimulus. \nPlatelet antiaggregate activity. Calcium ions act as a second messenger to platelet agonists, with increases in intracellular calcium bringing about changes in shape, aggregation, and release reactions. Changes in platelet function have been reported previously in migraine sufferers and there is evidence that hyperaggregability occurs during a migraine attack. It was decided to assess platelet aggregation with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from nicardipine-treated migraine sufferers because dihydropyridine derivatives are known to inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- and epinephrine-induced aggregation. Aggregation induced by 1.4 mumol/L arachidonic acid was similar in PRP from control subjects and untreated migraine sufferers, whereas 1 or 2 mumol/L ADP-induced aggregation was lower in PRP from migraine sufferers. Treatment with 20 mg of nicardipine three times daily for 2 months significantly (p less than 0.05) increased 2 mumol/L ADP-induced aggregation. It is concluded that nicardipine was acting either on migraine pathogenic mechanisms or directly on the platelets. \nDetection of Epstein-Barr virus sequences in Hodgkin's disease by the polymerase chain reaction. The authors examined paraffin-embedded lymph node biopsies from 65 cases of Hodgkin's disease for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA, using the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction technique. Overall 40% of the cases were positive for EBV DNA; there were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of EBV positivity among the different subtypes of Hodgkin's disease. These results are in agreement with those of previous studies that employed less sensitive detection techniques and suggest that EBV either is present in pathologic tissues only in some phases of the evolution of Hodgkin's disease or is a pathogenetic factor involved in only a portion of cases. \nA comparison of the KTP/532-laser tonsillectomy vs. traditional dissection/snare tonsillectomy. This study compared tonsillectomy by potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP/532) laser with tonsillectomy by traditional dissection and snare. Eighty-three consecutive patients who were candidates for a tonsillectomy were randomly assigned to one of four groups in a prospective study. The four treatments were bilateral traditional dissection/snare tonsillectomy, bilateral KTP/532-laser tonsillectomy, left laser tonsillectomy and right dissection/snare tonsillectomy, and left dissection/snare tonsillectomy and right laser tonsillectomy. Intraoperative comparisons were made between the two methods with regard to blood loss and operating time. Postoperatively bleeding and healing time were also recorded. A questionnaire answered on a daily basis assessed the patient's pain. Disadvantages of the KTP/532 tonsillectomy included increased cost, increased total operating time as a result of increased setup time and laser malfunctions, delayed healing, and no statistically significant improvement in level of pain. The sole advantage associated with the KTP/532 laser tonsillectomy was decreased blood loss, which may be significant for patients with a coagulopathy. \nDipyridamole thallium scanning in the evaluation of coronary artery disease in elective abdominal aortic surgery. Dipyridamole thallium scanning was routinely performed on 68 consecutive patients who presented for elective aortic surgery. All 68 patients were judged by clinical assessment to be at low risk for perioperative cardiac complications. In addition, 42 of 68 patients had a history of myocardial infarction, stable angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 1). Twenty-six of 68 patients did not have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 2). In group 1, 34 of 4 patients had positive results on dipyridamole thallium scanning, and 15 of these patients were found to have critical coronary artery disease on subsequent cardiac catheterization; nine underwent immediate coronary artery bypass grafting, and six had their coronary artery disease treated medically and their vascular operations cancelled. The remaining 27 patients in group 1 underwent elective operations, with six (22%) of 27 sustaining postoperative cardiac complications. None of the group 2 patients was found to have critical coronary artery disease. All patients in group 2 underwent aortic operation without cardiac complication. Routine dipyridamole thallium scanning detected a 22% (15 of 68) incidence of critical coronary artery disease overall. There was a 36% (15 of 42) incidence of critical coronary artery disease in group 1 patients vs 0% in group 2 patients (95% confidence interval, 21% to 50%). We conclude that the use of dipyridamole thallium scanning in low-risk patients for cardiac screening prior to elective aortic operations is beneficial in selected patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings, but is not necessary in patients with no history of coronary artery disease. \nAdhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization on patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The rate of adhesion formation after ovarian electrocauterization has been described in two selective and unselective groups of patients with PCOS. The rate of this complication in the selective group was 0 from 16 ovaries and in the unselective group (5/25). However, the rate of major adnexal adhesion in the unselective group was 1 from 25 ovaries. \nHuman fetal hepatocytes respond to inflammatory mediators and excrete bile. Under strict observation of the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki Human Research Committee, primary hepatocyte cultures were prepared from second-trimester fetal liver specimens. We have shown for the first time that fetal hepatocytes have the capacity to produce an acute-phase response on treatment with inflammatory mediators. Addition of interleukin-6 to the cultures resulted in strong induction of C-reactive protein and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin expression, whereas albumin expression was repressed. In contrast to interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-beta did not induce C-reactive protein expression. However, as in adult hepatocytes, fetal cells responded to transforming growth factor-beta by reduced albumin synthesis. We were able to show by virtue of fluorescein excretion into sealed clefts that fetal hepatocytes have the functional capacity to form bile. Our findings indicate that second-trimester hepatocytes can be regarded as fairly mature liver cells. \nAminoglycoside toxicity--a survey of retinal specialists. Implications for ocular use. Surveyed members of the Retina, Macula, and Vitreous Societies reported 93 cases of macular infarction they believed to be related to administration of gentamicin sulfate; five, to administration of amikacin sulfate; and three, to administration of tobramycin sulfate. Most cases of infarction after administration of gentamicin occurred in eyes that received an intravitreous injection of 0.4 mg after vitrectomy, but a surprisingly high number, 17, occurred after injection of 0.1 or 0.2 mg, doses that are considered safe by many ophthalmologists. Four additional cases of infarction occurred in eyes that did not undergo vitrectomy after injection of 0.1 or 0.2 mg. Four of the five cases related to administration of amikacin occurred after intravitreous injection of 0.4 mg, and one of these four occurred in an eye that did not undergo vitrectomy. Twenty-three cases of macular infarction occurred in eyes that were treated with prophylactic subconjunctival injections of aminoglycosides after routine ocular surgery. Responses from this survey suggest that aminoglycoside-induced retinal infarction is widely recognized and more common than indicated from the small number of cases reported in the literature. The role of aminoglycosides in the prophylaxis of ocular infections and the management of endophthalmitis should be reevaluated. \nCerebrovascular regulation and neonatal brain injury. Neuropathology occurring as a result of hemodynamic injury occurs in up to 25% of preterm newborns of less than 1,500 gm birth weight and in a much smaller, but nonetheless meaningful, proportion of more mature infants. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular regulation have been proposed as major contributing factors to both ischemic and hemorrhagic injuries in the newborn brain. In this review we explore several factors that play a role in cerebrovascular regulation in the immature brain and relate them to what is known about vascular regulation in the mature brain and to the types of pathology that occur in the newborn brain. One goal in this \"decade of the brain\" should be to increase our basic and clinical knowledge about the cerebrovasculature of the newborn in order to enhance our ability to predict and prevent perinatal brain injury. \nEmergency intubation for paralysis of the uncooperative trauma patient. The impact of paralysis followed by intubation was studied in patients who had been traumatized and subsequently admitted to Lehigh Valley Hospital Center. Trauma admission records between January 1987 and June 1988 were reviewed. Fifty-seven patients, intubated for control of agitation and combativeness, were divided into high injury severity (HIS) and low injury severity (LIS) subgroups using admission trauma (TS) and injury severity scores (ISS). Thirty-eight (70%) were classified as HIS and 19 (30%) as LIS. All HIS patients had significant injuries diagnosed following paralysis with intubation (PWI). Mortality in the HIS group was 9%. The LIS subgroup was compared to a randomly selected group of similarly injured blunt trauma patients who did not require PWI. There were significant differences (P less than 0.05) in age, hospital cost, hours per day of nursing care, and percent of patients with an ETOH level greater than 100 mg%. Emergency paralysis with intubation is an effective method for controlling the uncooperative, combative, seriously injured patient. However, patients with low injury severity who require restraint have higher costs and require more care if they are paralyzed and intubated than if they are not. \nUltrasonography in the diagnosis of gynecologic disorders. Ultrasonographic examination is being used with progressively greater frequency as an aid in diagnosis of gynecologic disorders but too often without consideration of whether information other than that obtained from clinical examination is needed and whether ultrasonography can supply it. The size, number, and position of pelvic masses and, in some instances, the type of tumor can be identified, but it is not often necessary when operation is clearly indicated. Ultrasonographic screening for diseases of the reproductive organs has been proposed, but its use for this purpose is limited and it is not cost-effective. It should be used as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis, not as a primary diagnostic procedure. \nMolecular genetic considerations in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma tumorigenesis is consistent with a model by which tumorigenesis results if both alleles at the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus (RBI) are altered. Additional genetic evidence strongly suggests that another obligate event in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis is the homozygous alteration of another gene, p53. Both the RB1 gene and p53 have been proposed to act as tumor-suppressor genes, suggesting that, in this instance, tumorigenesis is the result of the loss of gene function of these two genes, rather than a gain of function. \nRisk factors for acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in the United States and association with hepatitis C virus infection. The Centers for Disease Control conducted intensive surveillance for acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in four sentinel counties over a 7-year period. Testing for antibody to hepatitis C virus was performed with the newly developed enzyme immunoassay. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis remained relatively stable (average, 7.1 cases per 100,000, but there were significant changes in disease transmission patterns. The proportion of patients with a history of blood transfusion declined from 17% to 6%, but the proportion with a history of parenteral drug use increased from 21% to 42%. The proportion of patients with histories of sexual exposure (6%), household exposure (3%), occupational exposure to blood (2%), or hemodialysis (0.6%) did not change over time. Antibody to hepatitis C virus was found in 45% of patients within 6 weeks of onset of illness and in 68% of patients followed up for at least 6 months. Patients with no history of transfusions were just as likely to be positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus as patients with transfusion-associated hepatitis, indicating that hepatitis C virus is the major causative agent of all non-A, non-B hepatitis in the United States. \nUpdate on functional anatomy and pathology of human eustachian tube related to otitis media with effusion. New anatomic and histopathologic information regarding the eustachian tube and its surrounding structure as well as possible mechanisms of opening and closing function and dysfunction are discussed in this article. In the past two decades, much light has been shed on the relationship between anomalies of the eustachian tube and the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion. Now that a technique for obtaining specimens for any histopathologic study that includes the temporal bone as well as the eustachian tube is available, it is hoped that, by harvesting and examining a large number of such specimens, more information will be gained about the relation between eustachian tube pathology and eustachian tube dysfunction, particularly as it relates to otitis media effusion. Only in this way can the clinical management of otitis media be improved. \nNucleolar organizer regions in vascular and neoplastic cells of human gliomas. The number of nucleolar organizer regions in vascular cells and neoplastic cells of human gliomas was counted by a combined staining technique: one-step silver colloid method for nucleolar organizer region-associated argyrophilic protein (AgNOR) and periodic acid-Schiff staining for basement membrane of vascular components. The number of AgNORs (mean +/- SD) in the vascular and neoplastic cells of various tumors tested was as follows: benign astrocytoma (Grade 2, n = 4), 1.52 +/- 0.07 and 1.80 +/- 0.13, respectively; anaplastic astrocytoma (Grade 3, n = 7), 1.98 +/- 0.23 and 2.87 +/- 0.50; and glioblastoma multiforme (Grade 4, n = 11), 2.05 +/- 0.29 and 3.13 +/- 1.13. AgNOR scores in vascular cells of benign astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of vascular cells in normal brain tissue without neoplastic alteration (1.26 +/- 0.05; n = 3; P less than 0.01, P less than 0.001, and P less than 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the AgNOR scores of vascular cells in high-grade gliomas (Grades 3 and 4) were significantly higher than those in low-grade gliomas (Grade 2) (P less than 0.01). These results indicate that the proliferative activity of both vascular and neoplastic cells in gliomas increased as histological malignancy advanced, and that the quantification of AgNORs was useful in evaluating proliferative activity in vascular cells as well as in assessing the malignancy of neoplastic tissues. \nImmunoblotting and culture positive endocarditis. Serum samples from patients with endocarditis due to Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus lactis and a \"nutritionally\" variant streptococcus were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all five species. In S mutans endocarditis there was an endocarditis specific pattern of IgM against bands of 220, 200, and 190 kilodaltons. In S pneumoniae IgM against antibody of a molecular weight greater than 150 kilodaltons was specific to endocarditis. In S agalactiae IgM against bands at 82, 71, and 66-67 kilodaltons was endocarditis specific. In S lactis endocarditis specific IgM was present against antigenic bands at 105, 66, 61 and 58 kilodaltons. With the \"nutritionally\" variant streptococcus it was impossible to distinguish between cases of endocarditis and controls. \nAcquired progressive lymphangioma. Acquired progressive lymphangioma is rare and can histologically mimic well-differentiated angioendothelioma. In a 9-year-old boy with acquired progressive lymphangioma, we demonstrated that the neoplasm consists of at least a vascular component and a smooth muscle component. The presence of type IV collagen around many vascular channels suggests that an intermediate stage of differentiation between blood vessels and lymphatics may be present. Our findings indicate that acquired progressive lymphangioma is most likely a complex hamartoma composed of vascular channels and smooth muscle. \nBrachial plexus anesthesia in pediatric patients. Between 1980 and 1988 at our institution, brachial plexus anesthesia (BPA) was used in 109 pediatric patients who underwent 142 surgical procedures on an upper extremity, including 134 axillary blocks. Most patients older than 6 years of age had their blocks and surgical procedures with moderate sedation. The success rate was high--92.4% of axillary blocks and 100% of other blocks were adequate for surgical intervention in patients who required only intravenous sedation. The postoperative course in the BPA group was compared with that in 109 age-matched control subjects who underwent 188 procedures on an upper extremity during general anesthesia (GA). Admission to the recovery room after anesthesia occurred less frequently in the BPA group than in the GA group (27.5% versus 91.0%; P less than 0.01). Furthermore, nausea and vomiting were less frequent in the BPA group than in the GA group (P less than 0.01). Outpatients in the BPA group were less likely to require narcotic analgesics before dismissal than were those in the GA group (12% versus 31%; P less than 0.05). Admission of outpatients was infrequent in both groups (2% for BPA and 9% for GA). No significant difference was noted in 24-hour postoperative narcotic requirements between the BPA and GA groups. \nMassive evisceration: a complication following sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation. This report describes a spontaneous vaginal vault prolapse in association with massive evisceration following sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation. Careful attention to surgical technique is critical to the success of the operation. In particular, good apposition of the vaginal vault to the sacrospinous ligament and adequate repair of an enterocele should avoid this complication. \nHip disarticulation: factors affecting outcome. Hip disarticulation, especially in patients with peripheral vascular disease, has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This report describes patient characteristics that influence the clinical outcome of hip disarticulation. The medical records of all patients undergoing hip disarticulation from 1966 to 1989 were reviewed for surgical indication, perioperative wound complications, and postoperative deaths. Fifty-three patients underwent hip disarticulation for limb ischemia (10), infection (12), infection and ischemia (14), or tumor (17). The overall incidence of wound complications was 60%, and no significant differences were found among the groups. Prior above-knee amputation and urgent/emergent operations were significantly associated with increased wound complications (p less than 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 21%, ranging from 0% (tumor) to 50% (ischemia) and differed significantly among the groups (p less than 0.02). Mortality was significantly associated with urgent/emergent operations (p less than 0.01). Age, diabetes mellitus, and previous inflow procedures did not influence mortality rates. The presence of limb ischemia influenced mortality rates to a greater extent than did infection, and a history of cardiac disease was statistically predictive of death. Wound complications frequently accompanied hip disarticulation, regardless of operative indication, and were significantly increased by urgent/emergent operations and prior above-knee amputation. Hip disarticulation can be performed with low mortality rates in selected patients. Both limb ischemia and infection substantially increase operative mortality rates. \nBenefit of a stroke unit: a randomized controlled trial. In a randomized controlled trial we compared the clinical outcome of acute stroke patients, 110 of whom were allocated to treatment in a stroke unit and 110 to treatment in general medical wards. No significant difference existed between these groups with regard to sex, age, marital status, medical history, or functional impairment on admission. Outcome was measured at 6 and 52 weeks after the stroke by the proportion of patients at home, the proportion of patients in an institution, the mortality, and the functional state. After 6 weeks 56.4% of the patients randomized to the stroke unit and 32.7% of the patients randomized to the general medical wards were at home (p = 0.0004), and after 52 weeks 62.7% and 44.6%, respectively, were at home (p = 0.002). After 6 weeks 36.3% of the patients from the stroke unit and 50.0% from the general medical wards were in an institution (p = 0.02); after 52 weeks 12.7% and 22.7%, respectively, were institutionalized (p = 0.016). After 6 weeks mortality was 7.3% for the stroke unit group and 17.3% for the general medical wards group (p = 0.027). After 52 weeks mortality was 24.6% for the stroke unit group and 32.7% for the general medical wards group (difference not significant). Functional state was significantly better for patients treated in the stroke unit after both 6 and 52 weeks. We conclude that care of patients with acute stroke in a stroke unit improves clinical outcome compared with treatment in general medical wards. \nCost and quality trade-offs in the treatment of hypertension. The cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension is positively related to the level of pretreatment blood pressure and to the level of success in achieving patient adherence to prescribed medical regimens. Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment include limiting treatment to patients with well-documented sustained increases in blood pressure, giving higher priority to the treatment of patients with diastolic blood pressures of 100 mm Hg and above, and relying on lower-cost medications if clinical responses to treatment permit. In patients with mild hypertension, a comparison of strategies for initiating pharmacological treatment that takes into account potential side effects as well as the costs of medications indicates a difference of $270/patient-yr between the least and most expensive alternatives. Whether the additional costs of more expensive treatment strategies are \"worth it\" depend on any additional health benefits actually conferred. Moreover, higher-cost strategies may have negative influences on patients' decisions to adhere to prescribed regimens or to continue in treatment. Cost is a particular problem for the treatment of chronic conditions like hypertension because of inadequate insurance coverage for medications, especially for the poor. \nAcupuncture in angina pectoris: does acupuncture have a specific effect? To overcome the methodological problems of blinding the patients and the acupuncturist in acupuncture trials, 33 patients with stable angina pectoris, who were randomized to either genuine or sham acupuncture, received electroacupuncture by another acupuncturist, and the change in skin temperature was recorded. It was found that the change in skin temperature correlated significantly with the degree of improvement following both genuine and sham acupuncture. Fourteen patients with no decrease in skin temperature exhibited a significantly better response to acupuncture than 19 patients who showed a decrease in skin temperature (G II). In the former group, there was a 15% median improvement in exercise tolerance (G II 0%), a 67% improvement in anginal attack rate (G II 38%), and an 84% improvement in nitroglycerine consumption (G II 50%). A significant correlation was found between the duration of disease and the effect of acupuncture. It is concluded that both genuine and sham acupuncture have a specific effect on some angina pectoris patients in addition to the effect of pharmacological therapy. \nNasal positive pressure ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure. Difficult and time-consuming procedure for nurses. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are well-established techniques in the management of patients with acute respiratory failure; however, there are situations in which these procedures cannot be used safely for various reasons. A recently described noninvasive technique, nasal positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV), has been developed for home ventilation of certain patients with chronic ventilatory insufficiency. We hypothesized that NPPV could be used in selected patients in whom intubation and mechanical ventilation were clearly indicated, but not immediately possible, or even contraindicated. Six patients were treated with NPPV during an episode of acute respiratory failure and enrolled in a prospective study. We found that NPPV was successful in avoiding intubation, but only in the three patients suffering from a restrictive pulmonary disorder, whereas the procedure was unsuccessful in patients with obstructive disorders. Moreover, in every patient, acute NPPV was very time-consuming for the nursing staff: in patients with restrictive disorders, a nurse had to monitor a patient submitted to NPPV during 41 +/- 9 percent of the duration of ventilation and during 91 +/- 9 percent of the NPPV time in patients with obstructive disorders. We conclude that acute NPPV may be attempted in selected patients with acute respiratory failure, predominantly patients with restrictive respiratory disorders, but that this procedure is very time-consuming for nurses. \nEmergency esophagogastrectomy for treatment of hydrochloric acid injury. Eight patients with severe hydrochloric acid injury of the esophagus and stomach had early esophagogastrectomy. Four patients survived and 6 to 8 weeks later underwent successful substernal colon replacement. The value of early diagnosis and subsequent aggressive surgical management of patients who have ingested hydrochloric acid is stressed. \nTreatment of refractory chronic Lyme arthritis with arthroscopic synovectomy. Of 20 patients who underwent arthroscopic synovectomy for refractory chronic Lyme arthritis of the knee, 16 (80%) had resolution of joint inflammation during the first month after surgery or soon thereafter, and they have remained well during the 3-8-year followup period. Three of these 16 patients who were more disabled preoperatively, still had mild functional limitation at long-term followup. The remaining 4 patients (20%) had persistent or recurrent synovitis. We conclude that arthroscopic synovectomy is effective in treating chronic Lyme arthritis in patients in whom the disease does not respond to antibiotic therapy. \nUltrasonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Ultrasonography with graded compression was performed in 525 patients with clinical signs of acute appendicitis. Of 207 patients with surgically proven appendicitis the inflamed appendix (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) had been visualized sonographically in 177 (86 per cent). The score for non-perforated appendicitis (91 per cent) was higher than for perforated appendicitis (55 per cent). Twenty-four patients in whom an inflamed appendix was seen on ultrasonography did not undergo surgery because of rapidly subsiding symptoms ('abortive appendicitis'). Four of these 24 developed recurrent appendicitis warranting surgery. Two underwent elective appendectomy and 18 have remained symptom-free. Of 155 patients with a subsequently confirmed alternative condition, ultrasonography made the correct diagnosis in 140: bacterial ileocaecitis (69), mesenteric lymphadenitis (eight), gynaecological conditions (34), urological conditions (eight), caecal diverticulitis (six), perforated peptic ulcer (six), Crohn's disease (two) and miscellaneous conditions (seven). Of 139 patients in whom no definite diagnosis was made ultrasonography showed no abnormalities in 138. In four patients a false positive sonographic diagnosis of appendicitis was made and in two patients with appendicitis an alternative condition was incorrectly diagnosed. During the last 3 years of the study the negative appendicectomy rate was 7 per cent and delay beyond 6 h after admission occurred in only 2 per cent of patients with surgically proven appendicitis. When used to complement the clinical diagnosis ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and patient management in those suspected of having acute appendicitis. \nLactose intolerance. Pinpointing the source of nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. Lactose intolerance is a common condition that can cause nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. A reliable diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of the patient's history. The breath hydrogen test is simple, noninvasive, accurate, and inexpensive and is the diagnostic method of choice. In addition to traditional dietary restriction of lactose, treatment may consist of alterations in dietary fat content or caloric density to reduce symptoms and use of dairy products or additives that provide lactase activity. \nComparison of speech perception abilities in deaf children with hearing aids or cochlear implants. The speech perception abilities of deaf children with a single- or multi-channel cochlear implant are compared with those of deaf children who derive substantial benefit from conventional hearing aids. The children with hearing aids have unaided pure-tone thresholds ranging from 90- to 110-dB HL through at least 2000 Hz, and aided thresholds of 30- to 60-dB HL. The group data show that the speech perception scores of the subjects with hearing aids were significantly higher than those of the subjects with implants on a range of speech perception measures. Although a few subjects with implants achieved scores as high as those who used hearing aids, the majority did not. Even though the children with implants receive substantial benefit from their devices, they continue to have limited auditory perception abilities relative to their peers who derive benefit from conventional hearing aids. The data highlight the importance of establishing hearing aid benefit in potential candidates for implant. \nIntermittent ischemia potentiates intestinal reperfusion injury. We hypothesized that even brief periods of reperfusion interjected between ischemic episodes would increase tissue injury. Studies were performed in a rat small intestine preparation in which metabolic, hemodynamic, and histologic responses to ischemia have been well characterized. Animals were subjected to a total of 30 or 45 minutes of complete intestinal ischemia. Flow interruption was continuous (C, single episode) or intermittent (I, two or three episodes of 15-minute ischemia separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion). In some experiments 5-minute reperfusions were performed with arterial blood depleted of leukocytes (IL). This additional perturbation was included to determine the role of neutrophils that have been strongly implicated in reperfusion injury. In all three protocols histologic sections were obtained after each ischemic insult and after 1 hour of reperfusion with arterial blood. Villous histology was graded in a blinded fashion with 1 = normal and 5 = severe injury. No significant differences were found between groups in immediate postischemic histologies before reperfusion. After 1 hour of reperfusion, intermittent episodes of ischemia were associated with significantly worse histologic injury than that seen with comparable durations of continuous ischemia (30 min: I, 4.4 +/- 0.5 vs C, 2.7 +/- 0.4; 45 min: I, 4.9 +/- 0.2 vs C, 2.8 +/- 0.3). However, if 5-minute reperfusions were with leukopenic blood, this effect was markedly reduced (30 min IL, 3.4 +/- 0.3; 45 min IL, 3.6 +/- 0.2). Even short periods of reperfusion during an ischemic insult greatly increased mucosal injury. \nImmunohistochemical analysis of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, Ki-67 antigen, and human papillomavirus DNA in normal and neoplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix. To investigate the relationship between the sex steroid receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]) status and the cell proliferation kinetics during the menstrual cycle in normal and neoplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix, immunohistochemical localization of ER, PR, and cell proliferation-associated antigen, Ki-67, was investigated in 35 normal cervical specimens, 3 condylomas, 26 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) samples, and 22 invasive squamous carcinoma samples. The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was also studied. In the normal cervix, basal cells were usually ER positive, PR negative, and Ki-67 negative throughout the menstrual cycle. Parabasal cells were ER positive and PR negative in the follicular phase, but ER negative and PR positive, and Ki-67 positive in the luteal phase, and Ki-67-positive cells increased in number in the luteal phase. In contrast, PR positivity was observed in the cells of condyloma (2 of 2 cases), CIN (19 of 26 cases), and invasive squamous carcinoma (13 of 22 cases) irrespective of the menstrual phase. Moreover, most neoplastic cells containing HPV DNA type 16/18 were ER negative, whereas several lesions containing HPV DNA type 31/33/35 were weakly ER positive. Many Ki-67-labeled cells were observed in the neoplastic lesions. These results suggest that reduced ER expression and increased PR expression are associated with the proliferation of normal cervical squamous epithelium, and this proliferation-related receptor status, which is probably induced by HPV infection, is usually expressed in neoplastic cervical squamous cells. \nMaintenance treatment of duodenal ulceration: ranitidine 300 mg at night is better than 150 mg in cigarette smokers. Two hundred patients received either ranitidine 150 mg or 300 mg at night for 18 months to prevent duodenal ulcer relapse. Recurrence rates were lower in patients receiving the higher dose of ranitidine (3.1% v 9.7%, p = 0.78; 6.5% v 16.7%, p = 0.037; and 8.9% v 17.0%, p = 0.121 at six, 12, and 18 months respectively). In patients receiving ranitidine 150 mg, recurrences were significantly more common in smokers than non-smokers after 12 and 18 months, while in patients receiving ranitidine 300 mg recurrence rates were similar in smokers and non-smokers. Ranitidine 300 mg at night abolishes the adverse effect of smoking observed during maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 mg at night and may therefore be an appropriate maintenance dose for smokers who relapse during standard dose maintenance treatment. \nPrimary cardiac sarcomas. In marked contrast to benign cardiac tumors, primary cardiac sarcomas occur infrequently. Moreover, there is no uniform approach to treating such patients, and the benefits of postoperative chemotherapy are unclear. Between 1964 and 1989, 21 patients with primary cardiac sarcomas underwent surgical resection alone (n = 7), chemotherapy alone (n = 1), or combined operation and postoperative chemotherapy based on adriamycin (n = 13). Twenty-four operations were performed on 20 patients with relief of symptoms in all. Eleven patients had complete resection. Operative mortality was 8.3% (2/24). Histology and originating chamber(s) included angiosarcoma (n = 7; 6/7 in right atrium, 1 in left atrium), malignant fibrous histocytoma (7; all in left atrium), fibrosarcoma (2; 2/2 in left atrium), rhabdomyosarcoma (2; 1 in left atrium, 1 in right ventricle), leiomyosarcoma (2; 1 in left atrium, 1 in left ventricle); and one undifferentiated sarcoma (right atrium). Overall actuarial survival was 14% at 24 months after resection. Patients with complete resection had a median survival of 24 months compared with only 10 months in all other patients (p = 0.035). Postoperative chemotherapy did not enhance survival in patients with incomplete resection. At this time, aggressive and complete surgical resection seems to offer the best hope for palliation and survival in an otherwise fatal disease. \nDecreased serum growth hormone-binding protein in patients with liver cirrhosis. The recently characterized GH-binding protein (GH-BP) has an amino acid sequence identical to the extracellular domain of the GH receptor. Serum GH-BP reflects the amount of GH receptors, and the liver seems to be their main source. To evaluate the effect of liver disease on GH-BP, 52 patients with liver cirrhosis were studied. Serum GH-BP was measured by a binding assay with dextran-coated charcoal separation. Levels of GH-BP were correlated against the clinical state, assessed by Pugh's score. The GH-BP of 31 Pugh's class A patients was 9.7 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum, and that of 21 Pugh's class B and C patients was 7.2 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum compared to 11.3 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum in age-matched controls. GH-BP correlated negatively with Pugh's score and serum bilirubin, and positively with serum albumin. It did not correlate with serum liver enzymes or serum insulin-like growth factor-I. Scatchard analysis of GH binding to the GH-BP revealed similar binding affinities in Pugh's A, B, and C patients and controls. The binding capacity in cirrhosis was significantly lower than that in controls. We conclude that serum GH-BP is controlled mainly by the liver and can provide an additional measure of disease severity in liver cirrhosis. \nTeaching intubation skills using newly deceased infants. This prospective study was designed to (1) test the hypothesis that the majority of families of newly dead infants in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit would consent to their infants' being intubated for teaching purposes, (2) determine factors related to family consent, and (3) determine the effects of participation on resident physicians and respiratory therapists. Family consent for intubation was requested following 44 (80%) of the 55 deaths that occurred during the 10-month study period. Of these requests, 32 (73%) were granted. Proportionately more white than black families consented and consent was positively related to autopsy permission. Fifty-three (75%) of 71 trainees completed a mailed questionnaire after their first intubation experience. Although each respondent found the experience helpful, many reported mixed feelings categorized as doubt about participating, apprehension and discomfort, respect for the body, appreciation for the opportunity, a sense of achievement, and feelings of comfort knowing that consent had been obt",
