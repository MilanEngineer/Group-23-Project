        "text": " (Alzheimer's disease), two patients with recurrent glioblastoma, and three patients with focal lesions (stroke, arachnoid cyst and head trauma]. T2-weighted axial magnetic resonance images and transaxial 99mTc-HMPAO and 201Tl images acquired with an annular gamma camera were merged using an objective registration (translation, rotation and rescaling) program. In the normal subjects and patients with dementia and focal lesions, focal areas of high uptake corresponded to gray matter structures. Focal lesions observed on MRI corresponded to perfusion defects on SPECT. In the patients who had undergone surgical resection of glioblastoma followed by interstitial brachytherapy, increased 201Tl corresponding to recurrent tumor could be localized from the superimposed images. The method was evaluated by measuring the residuals in all subjects and translational errors due to superimposition of deep structures in the 12 subjects with normal thalamic anatomy and 99mTc-HMPAO uptake. This method for superimposing magnetic resonance and high-resolution SPECT images of the brain is a useful technique for correlating regional function with brain anatomy. \nEffect of Iraqi missile war on incidence of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death in Israeli civilians. The Iraqi missile attack on Israel provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of fright due to a perceived threat of annihilation on the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden death among the civilian population. During the first days of the Gulf war we noted a sharp rise in the incidence of acute MI and sudden death in our area compared with five control periods. Patient population in the various study periods did not differ significantly in age, sex ratio, hospital mortality, or proportion of patients in whom the acute event was the first presentation of coronary disease. However, during the first period of the war there were more cases of anterior wall MI and more patients received thrombolytic therapy than during control periods. Despite the continuing missile threat, the incidence of acute MI reverted to normal after the initial phase of the Gulf war. \nCorrelative angiographic and pathologic findings in the diagnosis of ulcerated plaques in the carotid artery. We determined the accuracy of angiography in the diagnosis of internal carotid ulcers by comparing the angiographic reports with the pathologic findings in 36 endarterectomy specimens. Eighteen of these specimens had microscopic ulcerations, and the observer with the highest accuracy rate read 12, of which ten were ulcerated. These results revealed a sensitivity of 56%, a specificity of 89%, and an overall accuracy of 61% for angiography. The ulcers were classified into types A, B, and C to assess the interobserver agreement rate among three readers. This resulted in a 4% interobserver agreement among a total of 75 ulcers. Because of the high interobserver disagreement and the poor correlation between angiographic and pathologic findings in the surgical specimens, we conclude that the diagnosis of carotid artery ulceration by angiography is not reliable. \nMeasurement of hip prostheses using image analysis. The maxima hip technique. A computer-based image analysis system has been developed as a research tool in total hip replacement. The system has been programmed to take multiple measurements from coronal plane radiographs. Poor quality radiographic images can be enhanced and standardised. The measurements which can be obtained include stem subsidence, cup migration, cup wear, and stem loosening. Reproducibility and accuracy were +/- 0.01 mm and +/- 0.5 mm respectively. The present application is in retrospective research, but prospective monitoring of radiographs is planned. \nFailure of wild-type or a mutant form of protein kinase C-alpha to transform fibroblasts. A mutant form of the alpha-isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) was recently isolated from an ultraviolet radiation-induced murine fibrosarcoma cell line and reported to transform mouse BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts on transfection. Four point mutations in the regulatory domain were assumed to be responsible for its oncogenicity and unusual preference for membrane localization. Here, we report that overexpression of the reported mutant PKC alpha complementary DNA in three fibroblast cell lines, including BALB/c 3T3, does not enable these cells to grow in soft agar or nude mice. In addition, this mutant PKC alpha form seems to be indistinguishable from the wild-type PKC alpha with respect to its dependence on cofactors, phorbol ester binding, subcellular distribution and its effects on growth and morphology. These results fail to confirm the previous study and indicate that overexpression of either the wild-type or the reported mutant form of PKC alpha does not transform rodent fibroblasts. \nAnalysis of pituitary hormones and chromogranin A mRNAs in null cell adenomas, oncocytomas, and gonadotroph adenomas by in situ hybridization. To study the relationship between null cell adenomas, oncocytomas and gonadotroph adenomas, we analyzed 32 surgically removed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pituitary tumors for the expression of pituitary hormone messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by in situ hybridization (ISH). Most tumors were also analyzed for chromogranin A mRNA. To identify the cell type constituting the tumors and to assess hormone content, all tumors were investigated by histology, transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Most null cell adenomas (6/11) and gonadotroph adenomas (9/10) expressed the mRNAs for alpha-subunit of glycoprotein hormones whereas only 2/11 oncocytomas expressed alpha-subunit mRNA. FSH beta and/or LH beta mRNA were present in most null cell and gonadotroph adenomas but only in a few oncocytomas. Prolactin (PRL) mRNA was detected in two null cell tumors and in one gonadotroph adenoma, whereas GH and POMC mRNA were present in one null cell adenoma. Chromogranin A mRNA, which codes for the major secretory granule protein, was present in 25/26 tumors including all tumors that were negative for pituitary hormone mRNAs, indicating adequate preservation of specific mRNA transcripts in the paraffin-embedded sections of tumor cells. These results indicate that null cell adenomas and gonadotroph adenomas are closely related neoplasms and that oncocytomas may represent a functionally defective form of null cell adenoma characterized by mitochondrial abundance, which has retained the capacity to synthesize the major secretory granule protein chromogranin A. Although the cytogenesis of null cell adenomas and oncocytomas is not clear, it can be suggested that these two tumor types are derived from a pluripotential precursor cell that is capable of undergoing multidirectional differentiation and synthesizing various hormones, mainly glycoproteins. \nLocalization of endogenous beta-galactoside-binding lectin as a means to distinguish malignant from benign skin tissue. The immunolocalization of a 30-kd endogenous lectin, referred to as galaptin, was studied in various skin tumor types. Basal cell carcinomas expressed little or no galaptin, whereas nonmalignant basaloid cells, squamous cell carcinomas, melanoma, nevi, and stroma showed more prominent galaptin immunostaining. Therefore, the immunodetection of galaptin may aid the dermatopathologist in difficult histologic diagnosis. \nPain-related somatosensory evoked potentials in syringomyelia. Pain-related somatosensory evoked potentials following CO2 laser stimulation (pain SEPs) and conventional electrically-stimulated SEPs (electric SEPs) were examined in 8 patients with syringomyelia who showed various forms of dissociated sensory loss. Unlike clinical examination using a pin or needle, pain SEP is considered to be an objective and quantitative test to investigate functions of peripheral and central sensory pathways responsible for pain-temperature sensation (A delta fibres and the spinothalamic tract). Pain SEPs were abnormal in all patients. The results were generally compatible with the degree of a clinical impairment of pain-temperature sensation. Subclinical abnormality was detected in 3 patients. Electric median nerve SEPs using the scalp reference (Fz) were normal in 6 out of 8 patients. However, anterior and posterior cervical responses using a noncephalic reference were absent or small in 7 patients. Electric SEPs following tibial nerve stimulation were normal in 7 patients. These findings suggest that the function of the ascending fibres through the dorsal columns is intact in most patients, whereas the dorsal horn, where a fixed cervical potential is generated, is impaired. Pain SEPs combined with electric SEPs therefore appear to be extremely useful for investigating physiological function in the sensory pathways in patients who show 'dissociated sensory loss' such as in syringomyelia. \nCoronary-subclavian steal: correction of recurrent angina and cerebrovascular symptoms. Six months following aortic valve replacement and myocardial revascularization using the left internal mammary artery as a pedicle graft, recurrent angina and cerebrovascular symptoms occurred in our patient. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a subtotal stenosis of the proximal left subclavian artery and a patent internal mammary artery graft with angiographic steal from the myocardium. The angina and cerebrovascular symptoms were relieved with correction of the proximal subclavian stenosis by balloon angioplasty. This demonstrates the importance of aortic arch and subclavian evaluation and selected angiography prior to myocardial revascularization using the internal mammary artery as a pedicle graft. \nSmall animal thrombosis models for the evaluation of thrombolytic agents. BACKGROUND. Two thrombosis models for the evaluation of thrombolytic agents in small animals (less than 100 g) were evaluated: an iodine-125 fibrin-labeled rat plasma clot in the inferior caval vein of 3-4-week-old rats and a pulmonary embolus in adult hamsters that had been obtained by injection of a 125I fibrin-labeled human plasma clot. The extent of thrombolysis was determined by continuous external monitoring of radioisotope over the thrombus region and by ex vivo recovery of residual clot. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the rat model, infusion of solvent for 60 minutes was associated with mean +/- SEM lysis within 90 minutes of 13 +/- 3% (n = 8) by external counting and 26 +/- 4% (n = 8) by radioisotope recovery. Intravenous infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) over 60 minutes caused dose-dependent progressive clot lysis; with 0.5 mg/kg, producing a plasma level of 0.14 +/- 0.04 microgram/ml, lysis was 64 +/- 9% (n = 4) by external gamma counting and 78 +/- 4% (n = 4) by residual isotope in the vein segment and was not associated with significant fibrinogen or alpha 2-antiplasmin breakdown. In the hamster model, infusion of solvent for 60 minutes was associated with lysis within 90 minutes of 19 +/- 4% (n = 11) by external gamma counting and 31 +/- 3% (n = 14) by residual radioisotope. Intravenous rt-PA during 60 minutes resulted in dose-dependent progressive thrombolysis; with 0.5 mg/kg, producing a plasma level of 0.14 +/- 0.01 micrograms/ml, lysis was 50 +/- 4% (n = 4) by external gamma counting and 78 +/- 5% (n = 4) by residual radioactivity, without an extensive decrease in fibrinogen or alpha 2-antiplasmin. Parallel experiments in the rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model with a rabbit blood clot with intravenous infusion over 4 hours produced 7 +/- 2% (n = 9) lysis with solvent and dose-dependent progressive lysis with rt-PA; with 1 mg/kg, producing a plasma level of 0.20 +/- 0.03 microgram/ml, lysis was 56 +/- 7% (n = 7) by external gamma counting and 61 +/- 7% (n = 7) by residual radioactivity, without extensive consumption of fibrinogen or alpha 2-antiplasmin. CONCLUSIONS. These two thrombosis models in small animals are as reproducible and quantitative as the extensively used rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model. The hamster pulmonary embolism model is superior because it is simpler and more straightforward and allows the performance of as many as 10 experiments by one investigator in 1 day. \nTuberculous pleural effusions: increased culture yield with bedside inoculation of pleural fluid and poor diagnostic value of adenosine deaminase. A prospective study of 111 adult patients with a pleural effusion was carried out in an area with a high prevalence of tuberculosis to compare the yield of bedside with laboratory inoculation of pleural fluid, and the yield and speed of a radiometric mycobacterial culture system (BACTEC) with that of conventional culture. The use of adenosine deaminase activity in pleural fluid as a diagnostic test for tuberculosis was also evaluated. In the 62 cases of tuberculosis confirmed histologically or by culture, or both, the BACTEC system had the same culture yield as conventional mycobacterial culture (positive in 14 cases-23%), but was significantly faster (18 versus 33 days). Bedside inoculation had a culture yield significantly higher than laboratory inoculation in the 24 patients tested (11 versus four). The remaining three diagnostic categories were malignant (28), miscellaneous (10), and undiagnosed (11). Median adenosine deaminase activity was significantly higher in tuberculous effusions than in any of the other categories, but there was considerable overlap between the groups. It is concluded that the BACTEC system is significantly faster than conventional mycobacterial culture and that bedside inoculation of pleural fluid substantially increases culture yield. Adenosine deaminase does not provide as valuable a diagnostic test of pleural tuberculosis as has been suggested. \nThe role of preoperative CT scans in staging external auditory meatus carcinoma: radiologic-pathologic correlation study. Survival is related to the pathologic extent of tumor in external auditory meatus (EAM) carcinoma. This study assesses the validity of preoperative CT scans in staging EAM carcinoma. The accuracy of staging EAM carcinoma with preoperative CT scans was evaluated by comparing radiography and histopathology. Patients who received preoperative CT scan were selected from a retrospective series of 35 temporal bone resections for EAM squamous cell carcinoma. The CT scans were systematically reviewed for tumor involvement in 12 anatomic areas. The histopathology slides for the corresponding patients were reviewed according to the same criteria. CT scan findings accurately diagnosed the extent of tumor involvement identified during histopathologic examination. These tumors demonstrated the capacity to spread along existing anatomic pathways as well as direct bone erosion. We conclude that preoperative CT scans accurately stage EAM squamous cell carcinoma. \nEffect of acupuncture-point stimulation on diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive subjects: a preliminary study. Electrical stimulation of four specific acupuncture points (Liver 3, Stomach 36, Large Intestine 11, and the Groove for Lowering Blood Pressure) was examined in order to determine the effect of this stimulation on diastolic blood pressure in 10 subjects with diastolic hypertension. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups: (1) an Acu-ES group, which received electrical stimulation applied to the four antihypertensive acupuncture points, and (2) a Sham-ES group, which received electrical stimulation applied to non-acupuncture-point areas. A repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a significant, immediate poststimulation reduction of diastolic blood pressure for the Acu-Es group versus the Sham-ES group. Further studies are needed to determine whether there are other acupuncture points, stimulation characteristics, or modalities that can enhance this treatment effect and whether the treatment effect can last for a clinically significant period of time. \nThe European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS): results by arterial distribution. The European Stroke Prevention Study was a multicenter study comparing the effect of the combination of dipyridamole, 75 mg, and acetylsalicylic acid, 330 mg, three times a day, to that of placebo in 2,500 patients in the secondary prevention of stroke or death after one or more transient ischemic attacks, reversible ischemic neurological deficits, or strokes of atherothrombotic origin. The patients with vertebrobasilar events at entry comprised one-third of the whole patient population. The overall total incidence of stroke or death (the end points) during the 2-year follow-up in the placebo group was lower in the vertebrobasilar group compared to the carotid group (14% versus 24%, respectively). The combination therapy of dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid caused a marked reduction in the incidence of stroke or death in patients with vertebrobasilar (51%) and carotid (30%) events. When only stroke was considered as the end point, dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid seemed to be more effective in reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks than stroke, and more effective in men than in women. \nFrequency and mechanism of bradycardia in cardiac transplant recipients and need for pacemakers. Orthotopic cardiac transplantation is occasionally complicated by unexplained bradyarrhythmias. Sinus node injury as a consequence of operation or acute rejection has anecdotally been linked to the development of bradycardia early after transplantation. These arrhythmias are empirically managed by pacemaker implantation, the indications for which remain poorly defined. This retrospective study examined the 20-year experience of our institution with bradyarrhythmias after transplantation to determine the predisposing factors and indications for pacemaker implantation. Forty-one of 556 patients in our cardiac transplant program (7.4%) received permanent pacemakers between 1969 and 1989. The predominant rhythm disturbances were junctional rhythm (46%), sinus arrest (27%) and sinus bradycardia (17%). Most patients were asymptomatic (61%), and presented in the early post-transplant period (73%). Four possible predisposing factors were evaluated: (1) graft ischemic time, (2) rejection history, (3) use of bradycardia-inducing drugs, and (4) anatomy of blood supply to the sinoatrial (SA) node. No significant differences existed between patients with and without pacemakers with regard to the first 3 variables. However, after transplantation angiograms showed that prevalence of abnormal SA nodal arteries was greater in patients with than without pacemakers (p less than 0.02). Pacemaker follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months showed persistent bradycardia (60 to 90 beats/min) in 88, 75 and 50% of patients, respectively. The most common pacemaker complication (15%) was lead displacement at time of biopsy. These results suggest that disruption of the SA nodal blood supply may be an important predisposing factor in the development of bradycardias. \nGlassy cell features in adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Histologic, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and clinical findings. Glassy cell features (GCF) were identified as composing a predominant pattern (more than 85% of histology) in six cases and a focal pattern (33-85% of histology) in 10 cases of a series of 53 adenocarcinomas (AC) and adenosquamous carcinomas (ADSQ) of the uterine cervix. In three cases examined ultrastructurally, GCFs correlated with many cytoplasmic polyribosomes and abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, but Golgi complexes and tonofilaments were scant and intracytoplasmic lumina were absent. Intracellular mucin was present in the areas showing GCFs of four ADSQs with predominant GCFs and six ADSQs with focal GCFs. Two of three cases examined ultrastructurally showed intracellular electron-dense material that corresponded to mucin secretory material. Immunohistochemical studies of the six ADSQs with predominant GCF cases showed the following pattern of reactivity: monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 2 of 6 cases; polyclonal CEA, 3 of 6; CA 125, 0 of 6; CA 19-9, 0 of 6; placental alkaline phosphatase, 0 of 6; and vimentin, 1 of 6. Focal GCF areas showed monoclonal CEA, 4 of 9 cases; polyclonal CEA, 3 of 9; vimentin, 4 of 9; while CA 125, CA 19-9, and placental alkaline phosphatase were negative in areas of GCFs. One of three patients with ADSQ with predominant GCFs and five of nine patients with ADSQ with focal GCFs with at least 1 year of follow-up were disease free. No association between GCFs (combined focal and predominant) and recurrent disease was present when compared to the other 29 AC and ADSQ patients with follow-up. Recurrent disease in our series of AC and ADSQ was only associated with stage III or IV disease at presentation (P less than 0.001). There was no association with adenosquamous histology, histologic grade, lymphatic invasion, or age. There were insufficient cases of ADSQ with predominant GCFs with follow-up to evaluate fully prognostic significance of this subgroup. Our study suggests that GCFs are part of the spectrum of differentiation in ADSQ of the cervix rather than a distinct histologic type of carcinoma with unique clinical significance. \nActivation of pain fibers to the internal carotid artery intracranially may cause the pain and local signs of reduced sympathetic and enhanced parasympathetic activity in cluster headache. Several clinical and circulatory physiological observations indicate that the internal carotid artery (ICA) with proximal pial and orbital-periorbital branches, as well as external carotid vessels adjacent to the orbital region, are involved in the autonomic symptoms of an attack of cluster headache. Evidence is presented here that an activation of pain fibers innervating the intracranial segment of ICA may cause not only the retroorbital pain of an attack but also, via the mechanical effect of a neurogenic inflammation in the vessel wall, the local symptoms of a sympathetic defect and, via a reflex are to the parasympathetic pathway along the greater superficial petrosal nerve, the local symptoms from glands and vessels of parasympathetic discharge. Dilation of the intracranial ICA due to activation of this parasympathetic pathway may aggravate pain. Possible mechanisms behind such a local pain fiber activation are discussed. \nUse of amiodarone for short-term and adjuvant therapy in young patients. Limited data are available defining the safety of amiodarone for short-term use or as part of combination antiarrhythmic therapy in pediatric patients. Results of amiodarone in 47 young patients for an average treatment duration of 12 months were examined. There were 21 male and 26 female patients (age range of 23 weeks gestation to 29 years). Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1--electrocardiographic documented ventricular tachycardia (n = 7); group 2--syncope of unknown cause (n = 16); group 3--primary atrial tachycardia (n = 11); and group 4--supraventricular tachycardia (n = 13). Amiodarone was clinically useful in 32 (68%) patients. Amiodarone was considered effective as a sole antiarrhythmic agent in 21 (45%) patients. Treatment was ineffective but was continued in 11 (23%) patients; in 10 of these 11 patients amiodarone was adjuvant to other antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone was considered ineffective and was withdrawn in 15 (32%) patients. No patient required cardiac pacemaker implant during therapy. Torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest occurred in 1 patient each after 9 and 14 days of therapy, respectively. Two patients underwent successful cardiac transplant after 2 and 14 months of amiodarone administration, respectively. Amiodarone was used as short-term treatment (less than 18 months) in 7 infants (age less than 18 months), and after cessation of treatment there was no recurrence of tachycardia for 4 to 24 months. Results of this study confirm reports of successful amiodarone use in pediatric patients with a variety of rhythm disturbances. \nRegression of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive heart transplant recipients treated with enalapril, furosemide, and verapamil. BACKGROUND. This prospective study was designed to examine whether left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy of the denervated transplanted heart may be reversed by medical therapy and, if so, to investigate the time course of this process and its effect on exercise capacity, myocardial function, and cardiac hemodynamics. METHODS AND RESULTS. Ten hypertensive heart transplant recipients with LV hypertrophy were evaluated before therapy with enalapril plus furosemide alone or combined with verapamil, at initial blood pressure (BP) control and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, using 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring, M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography, and supine bicycle ergometry. Average 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP declined from 158 +/- 10 and 104 +/- 7 mm Hg to 129 +/- 9 and 84 +/- 10 mm Hg at initial BP control (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.025, respectively) and total peripheral resistance from 1,687 +/- 177 to 1,376 +/- 122 dyne.sec.cm-5 (p less than 0.025), remaining normal thereafter. Exercise capacity remained unchanged during the study. LV mass, mass-to-volume ratio, and end-diastolic septal plus posterior wall thickness decreased progressively from 211 +/- 30 g, 2.49 +/- 0.62 g/ml, and 25.7 +/- 2.6 mm to 184 +/- 26 g, 2.22 +/- 0.46 g/ml, and 22.5 +/- 1.9 mm after 3 months (all p less than 0.025) and to 174 +/- 25 g, 2.07 +/- 0.38 g/ml, and 21.5 +/- 1.5 mm after 6 months (all p less than 0.005), remaining unaltered at 9 and 12 months. A correlation was found between the decrease in average 24-hour mean BP and LV mass after 3 months of antihypertensive therapy (r = 0.71, p less than 0.05). Systolic meridional wall stress, LV end-diastolic and stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output remained unchanged throughout the observation period. CONCLUSIONS. The results indicate that regression of LV hypertrophy is induced by effective antihypertensive therapy in the denervated transplanted heart. The extent of decrease in average 24-hour BP appears to be the main determinant for the extent of reduction in LV mass. LV afterload as characterized by systolic meridional wall stress, LV size and pump function, and physical exercise capacity of the transplant patients are not influenced by the therapeutic regimen chosen in this study. \nEpidemiology of myasthenia gravis in Denmark. A longitudinal and comprehensive population survey. The incidence of myasthenia gravis (MG) was found to be constant in calendar time. The mean annual incidence rate was 4.4 per million population. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates disclosed a bimodal appearance for both sexes, with a peak age at onset located in the early-onset group and another peak for late onset of MG. Early onset of MG appeared 10 years later for male individuals than for female individuals, whereas the peak for late onset of MG was located at the same age for both sexes. It is suggested that the separation between early onset and late onset of MG should be at the age of 50 years for both sexes, rather than at 35 to 40 years as accepted in most studies. The prevalence of MG has increased in time. On January 1, 1988, the point prevalence rate was 77 per million population (female subjects, 96, and male subjects, 57). This reflects an improvement in prognosis despite the fact that life expectancy was found to be significantly lower for MG patients than that of the sex- and age-matched population. The factors causing increased mortality were found to be operative throughout the duration of the disease. Maximum severity of disease was reached within 2 years from onset in 78% of the cases, and more than 50% of all MG-related deaths occurred during the same period. In the course of MG, 70% of all patients experience generalized muscular weakness, and 30% to 40% also suffer from respiratory problems. \nNear-infrared spectroscopy in peripheral vascular disease. Near-infrared spectroscopy has been performed on the calf muscles of 38 subjects, 21 normal controls without vascular disease and 17 patients with peripheral vascular disease. Oxygen consumption was measured in the calf by calculating the rate of conversion of oxyhaemoglobin to deoxyhaemoglobin during a period of tourniquet-induced ischaemia. Postischaemic reoxygenation was also measured. Median oxygen consumption in patients with peripheral vascular disease was 0.10 ml 100 g tissue-1 min-1, while in the control group it was 0.20 ml 100 g tissue-1 min-1 (P less than 0.03, Mann-Whitney U test). The median time taken to reach maximum oxyhaemoglobin levels after ischaemia was 40 s in patients with peripheral vascular disease and 20 s in controls (P less than 0.02). The results indicate that oxygen consumption is reduced in peripheral vascular disease. Near infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive method for assessing metabolic improvement resulting from surgical or pharmacological treatment. \nDiagnostic value of video-EEG polysomnography. To investigate the diagnostic value of video-EEG polysomnography (VPSG), we reviewed our experience in 122 patients with suspected parasomnias who underwent one or two nights of VPSG. Of 86 patients without known epilepsy, VPSG provided useful diagnostic information for 41 (69%) of those with a history of prominent motor activity during sleep and for 11 (41%) of those with a history of minor motor activity during sleep. Two children and one adult with clinical histories suggestive of sleep terrors had unequivocal partial seizures during VPSG. Of 36 patients with known epilepsy, VPSG was useful diagnostically in 28 (78%). VPSG is superior to standard polysomnography for the evaluation of parasomnias because of the increased capability to identify and localize EEG abnormalities and to correlate behavior with EEG and polysomnography. VPSG may also be a suitable alternative to intensive inpatient monitoring for some patients with known or suspected epilepsy who have frequent undiagnosed nocturnal spells. \nAbdominal aortic aneurysm in chronic thoracic dissection. Report of two cases. Two cases of lower abdominal aortic aneurysm in association with chronic thoracic dissections are reported. These infra-renal aortic aneurysms, superimposed on an abdominal extension of the dissection, always require surgical treatment because of their well known tendency to enlarge and rupture. The authors report their experience and discuss the management of this complication in chronic dissections treated surgically. \nSequestrin, a CD36 recognition protein on Plasmodium falciparum malaria-infected erythrocytes identified by anti-idiotype antibodies. The CD36 molecule expressed by human endothelial cells is a receptor for the adhesion of erythrocytes infected with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. A CD36-specific monoclonal antibody, OKM8, inhibits the adhesion of malaria-infected erythrocytes (IRBC) to purified CD36 and cells expressing CD36. Monospecific polyclonal anti-idiotype (anti-Id) antibodies, raised against monoclonal antibody OKM8, expressed determinants molecularly mimicking the CD36 binding domain for the adhesion of IRBC. Purified rabbit anti-Id antibodies reacted with the surface of IRBC by immunofluorescence, directly supported the adhesion of wild-type P. falciparum malaria isolates, and inhibited IRBC cytoadherence to melanoma cells. An approximately 270-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Id antibodies from surface-labeled and metabolically labeled IRBC and was competitively inhibited by soluble CD36. These results support the hypothesis that CD36 is a receptor and the approximately 270-kDa protein, sequestrin, is a complementary ligand involved in the adhesion of IRBC to host-cell endothelium. Sequestrin is a candidate malaria vaccine antigen, and anti-Id antibodies that recognize this molecule may be useful for passive immunotherapy of cerebral and severe P. falciparum malaria. \nHypothalamic amenorrhea: clinical perspectives, pathophysiology, and management. The development of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea reflects an individual's response to environmental stressors and life-style variables. In this disorder there are no detectable anatomic abnormalities with respect to the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian-endometrial axis. Current evidence suggests that the common underlying defect is a decrease in the activity of the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator. Of the neuroendocrine factors that appear to regulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone activity, the opiate and dopamine neuronal systems have been implicated as factors that are responsible in part for the decreased secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Because of the functional nature of this disorder, reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit would be expected to take place in most women after accommodation to environmental stressors or modification in life-style. For women with persistent anovulation, treatment with estrogen-replacement therapy should be offered. In those desiring fertility, ovulation induction with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone would be the most effective modality. \nThe office evaluation of infectious diarrhea. Diarrhea is a frequent complaint heard in the office practice of medicine and can represent any of a variety of processes, including several infectious causes. Clues to the infectious processes are reviewed and an approach to their evaluation from history, through physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and initial therapy are discussed. \nPrevalence of risk factors for heart disease in OXCHECK trial: implications for screening in primary care. Imperial Cancer Research Fund OXCHECK Study Group. OBJECTIVE--To describe the outcome of offering health checks systematically to a general practice adult population, in terms of age and sex specific prevalence of risk factors, follow up workload, and selective screening of cholesterol concentration. DESIGN--Descriptive analysis of data obtained by postal questionnaire and by personal interview and clinical examination by a trained nurse. SUBJECTS--2205 patients aged 35-64 who attended for a health check in 1989-90 from an invited random sample of 2777 patients from five urban general practices in Bedfordshire. RESULTS--Overall, almost three quarters of patients (78% of men, 68% of women) needed specific advice or follow up. Smoking, a high fat diet, and being overweight (body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2) were common characteristics exhibited by 35%, 31%, and 55% respectively of men and 24%, 18%, and 48% of women. The total cholesterol concentration was greater than or equal to 6.5 mmol/l in 37% of patients and greater than or equal to 8 mmol/l in 8%. In terms of workload 13% needed dietary advice only, 15% needed only follow up of hyperlipidaemia or hypertension, and 9% needed advice on smoking only. A further 35% needed follow up for a combination of risk factors. The proportion of patients in whom cholesterol concentration would be measured if a selective screening policy were adopted would vary from 29% to 71%, according to different criteria, but (particularly in men) no combination would be much better than random testing as a means to detect patients with a total cholesterol concentration greater than or equal to 8 mmol/l. CONCLUSIONS--If the entire adult population of a practice is offered health checks systematically the acceptance rate is lower and the follow up workload higher than previously understood. The resource implications depend on the age and sex of patients screened and the selective criteria adopted for cholesterol measurement. Health checks are only the beginning of a successful preventive programme--the challenge is to provide effective intervention and follow up. \nIntracellular gastrin in human gastrointestinal tumor cells. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses of the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line MKN45G identified an intracellular peptide recognized by an anti-gastrin-17 (G17) antiserum but not by an anti-cholecystokinin-specific antiserum. Staining was not associated with the parental line MKN45, of which MKN45G is a clonal variant. The MKN45G cell line had elevated in vitro growth in serum-free medium in which the proliferation of MKN45G cells but not MKN45 cells was reduced to 58% of the control value by treatment with a rabbit anti-G17 antiserum. This inhibition of proliferation was reversed by preabsorbing the antiserum with excess G17. Disaggregated primary human gastric and colorectal tumors were screened for gastrin immunoreactivity by flow cytometry, and 6 of 28 colorectal and 8 of 22 gastric tumors had greater than 20% positively staining cells. \nRole of arteriography in the preoperative evaluation of carotid artery disease. This retrospective study was undertaken to determine the role of arteriography in the treatment of patients being considered for carotid endarterectomy. The results of preoperative classification of disease severity by duplex ultrasound and arteriography were compared, and the impact of arteriography on patient management was ascertained. We reviewed the records of 83 patients who had carotid surgery planned on the basis of their clinical history and duplex scan results and who then underwent arteriography. Duplex scan results agreed with the classification of stenosis by arteriography in 87% of evaluated sides and were within one category in 98%. In 87% of the cases reviewed, the clinical presentation and duplex scan findings were sufficient for appropriate patient management. In the instances that arteriography was useful (13%), the need for arteriography was evident when the duplex scan (1) was technically inadequate or equivocal; (2) showed an unusual distribution of disease, atypical anatomy, or a recurrent lesion; or (3) demonstrated an internal carotid artery with diameter-reducing stenosis of less than 50% in a patient with hemispheric neurologic symptoms despite antiplatelet therapy. \nIntraocular tissue plasminogen activator in a rabbit model of traumatic hyphema. Tissue plasminogen activator was used to evaluate the clearance of traumatic hyphema in a rabbit model. A neodymium-YAG laser was used to disrupt iris vessels, creating a traumatic hyphema. Tissue plasminogen activator (1800 IU/0.1 mL) was injected into the anterior chamber 24 hours after creation of the hyphema. Two control groups (one receiving balanced salt solution and one receiving no treatment) were used for comparison. A multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that the greatest difference in hyphema clearance between the groups occurred at days 3, 4, and 5. Five days after tissue plasminogen activator treatment, the mean size of the clot remaining in the anterior chamber was 27% of that of the original hyphema. In control eyes, almost 60% of the original clot remained at day 5. Treatment of animals with tissue plasminogen activator doses of 5000 IU and 10,000 IU produced a substantial increase in repeated bleeding episodes in our rabbit model. We concluded that although the use of tissue plasminogen activator in our rabbit model of traumatic hyphema significantly improved clearance of blood from the anterior chamber, the remaining clot was of such size that the clinical benefit was questionable. \nDiagnosis and treatment of cranial neuralgias. Both medical and surgical therapies may be used in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Ordinarily, the treatment is medical; however, if a response to drugs is not forthcoming, or if the patient becomes toxic while taking medications or refuses to abide by an appropriate medical program, then surgical consultation should be obtained and the appropriate operation performed. The form and type of neurosurgical procedure will probably depend to a considerable extent on the expertise of the neurosurgeon and his training. Generally, in the elderly, the simplest procedure should be attempted first. It may be necessary to employ both medical and surgical procedures in the individual patient. The medical drug of first choice is carbamazepine. Atypical facial neuralgia is a general term used to cover a variety of head and face pains that are poorly defined and that may not deserve separate clinical status. The pathogenesis of the atypical facial neuralgias is uncertain, and multiple causation seems likely. Search for local inflammatory pathology, neoplasms, vasomotor phenomena, and depressive symptoms is indicated. Treatment should be guided by the findings. \nEmergency department echocardiography in the diagnosis and therapy of cardiac tamponade. A 44-year-old male presented to the emergency department in shock with jugular venous distension and upper chest cyanosis. Superior vena cava syndrome was ruled out by computed tomography (CT scan). However, a large pericardial effusion was found on CT scan and confirmed by sonography. Pericardial tamponade was diagnosed by emergency physicians and sonography-guided pericardiocentesis was performed with marked improvement in symptomatology. \nInterval report of a phase I-II study utilizing multiple modalities in the treatment of invasive bladder cancer. A bladder-sparing trial. Clinicians at the Massachusetts General Hospital have used two cycles of methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine (MCV) before radiotherapy and cisplatin in 53 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Eleven patients did not complete the protocol, but overall, the toxicity was not formidable. Of the total patients accessioned, 34 are alive. Of the 34 patients in the series who completed the full treatment protocol, the estimated survival rate at 54 months is 77%. This interim analysis suggests that the treatment is achieving at least limited success in saving lives and bladders. \nNosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill: product of aspiration or translocation? OBJECTIVE: To examine the possibility that nosocomial pneumonias might be caused by the translocation of enteric bacteria and their toxins. DESIGN: Prospectively collected previous database was examined by logistic regression analysis. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-two ICU patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The best stand-alone predictors for nosocomial pneumonia were bleeding from stress ulceration (p less than .001), the severity of illness present (p less than .001), and intramucosal acidosis in the stomach (p = .023), a metabolic indication of mucosal ischemia. Mechanical ventilation (p = .038) and the administration of antacids/cimetidine (p = .054) were also of stand-alone predictive value, but did not significantly improve the best predictive model for nosocomial pneumonia derived from the severity of illness present and the intramucosal pH in the stomach. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ischemic mucosal injury and its associated translocation of enteric bacteria and toxins might be more important in the pathogenesis of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill than the aspiration of contaminated nasopharyngeal secretions. \nUnsuspected uveal melanoma diagnosed after cataract extraction. Four cases of unsuspected uveal melanoma diagnosed after cataract extraction were found in a review of the records of enucleation specimens processed at our centre between 1974 and 1988. Similarities among the four cases included disparity in loss of visual acuity, unilateral angle-closure glaucoma, asymmetric cataract formation, inability to view the fundus and rapid flattening of the anterior chamber, with difficult closure at the time of surgery. Uveal melanoma should be suspected in any cataract patient presenting with one or more of these atypical clinical findings, and complete investigation, including A-scan and B-scan ultrasonography, is indicated. \nEvolving experience with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair at a single institution. Fifty-seven patients underwent repair of atherosclerotic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms between 1978 and 1990. Five patients had urgent surgery for rupture. The 30-day operative mortality rate for the entire group was 18% (10 patients). Before July 1987, 19 patients (group 1) were operated on by use of a technique previously described. In these earlier patients the peritoneum was routinely entered, the diaphragm was divided radially, and no heparin was given. Among patients in group 1 there was a 30-day operative mortality rate of 42% (8 patients), and morbidity included myocardial infarction 4 (21%), respiratory failure 9 (47%), renal failure 12 (63%), bleeding requiring reoperation 4 (21%), and intestinal ischemia 3 (16%). Since July 1987 a standardized approach to all elective thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms has been used in 38 patients (group 2). This method uses a left thoracoabdominal incision, circumferential division of the hemidiaphragm, retronephric totally extraperitoneal aortic exposure, single lung anesthesia, full heparinization, the graft inclusion technique, and liberal use of visceral endarterectomy. Patients in group 2 sustained a 30-day operative mortality rate of 5% (2 patients) and morbidity included myocardial infarction 2 (5%), respiratory failure 10 (26%), renal failure 11 (29%), bleeding requiring reoperation 1 (3%), paraplegia 6 (16%), and paraparesis 4 (11%). Modern surgery for repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm results in acceptably low operative mortality rates. Spinal cord ischemia remains an unresolved source of morbidity. \nCoronary restenosis: what have we learned from angiography? Coronary restenosis remains a major problem for interventional cardiology not only by virtue of its frequency, but also because of the current inability to prevent it. Symptomatic status and non-invasive evaluation have been used to study restenosis, but both lack specificity and sensitivity, particularly in patients with multivessel disease. Angiography remains the reference standard. Several arbitrary definitions have been used, some related to visual estimates of coronary stenosis and others to quantitative angiographic techniques. In another approach, linear modeling is used to assess minimal luminal diameter of lesions on restudy. Although angiographic studies have been essential in the study of restenosis, questions concerning the underlying mechanism and pathophysiology remain. The development of animal models that closely resemble human restenosis should allow evaluation of pathophysiologic mechanisms and development of new strategies to prevent the problem. \nMonoclonality in B cell lymphoma detected in paraffin wax embedded sections using the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to develop a simple technique for detecting monoclonality at the DNA level in B lymphocyte populations in formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded material. Sections were dewaxed and dehydrated, and the DNA was extracted by boiling in water for 45 minutes. A semi-nested PCR was performed to amplify the V-D-J region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. The product was electrophoresed and viewed under ultraviolet light after ethidium bromide staining. Specimens from 26 B cell lymphomas produced a monoclonal band in 24 cases and no amplification in two cases; monoclonality was specific for this disorder. Specimens from seven T cell lymphomas produced no amplification; specimens from nine reactive nodes produced a broad smear of polyclonal material; and specimens from 12 cases of carcinoma produced either no amplification or polyclonal material. As detection of monoclonality is strongly suggestive of neoplastic disease, this technique is likely to be of value in routine diagnosis, because of its speed, simplicity, and applicability to fixed, embedded material. \nInfection of the central nervous system due to Acanthamoeba. It is well established that Acanthamoeba castellanii, Acanthamoeba culbertsoni, Acanthamoeba polyphaga, and probably other species of free-living amebas are virulent opportunists capable of producing disease in humans and animals. Human infections involving brain, eyes, skin, and lungs have been reported from all continents. Central nervous system (CNS) infection due to Acanthamoeba species usually occurs in chronically ill, debilitated individuals, some of them receiving immunosuppressive therapy or taking broad-spectrum antibiotics. The disease runs a protracted, insidious clinical course and is known as granulomatous amebic encephalitis. Histopathologically, Acanthamoeba species may produce a multifocal, chronic, or subacute granulomatous encephalitis, with trophozoites and cysts present in CNS lesions. The portal of entry of the amebas into the CNS is probably the respiratory tract or a skin lesion, and the organisms reach the CNS by hematogenous spread. As of 1 January 1989, about 50 cases of granulomatous amebic encephalitis had been reported worldwide, 27 in the United States alone. \nPhase II trial of interferon gamma and monoclonal antibody 17-1A in pancreatic cancer: biologic and clinical effects. Thirty patients with advanced measurable pancreatic adenocarcinoma were entered onto a phase II trial with recombinant interferon gamma (Biogen, Cambridge, MA; 10(6) U/m2 daily for 4 days) and monoclonal antibody (Mab) 17-1A (Centocor, Malvern, PA; 150 mg in autologous leukocytes on days 2, 3, and 4 following interferon infusion). The effect of a single interferon gamma treatment on natural and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), Fc receptor occupancy by antibody, and human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression on monocytes and lymphocytes was also studied. Toxicity was modest and generally limited to grade I to II fever, nausea and vomiting, and hepatotoxicity. Five patients were considered to be nonassessable for response. Of the 25 assessable patients, one objective response (complete remission for a duration of 4 months) was observed. Stable disease for 2 months or greater was noted in nine patients. The median survival for the group was 5 months. Analysis of cytotoxicity data obtained prior to treatment showed reduced natural cytotoxic activity in these patients compared with normal volunteers. A significant improvement in natural cytotoxic activity to normal levels occurred within 24 hours following the interferon gamma infusion. This was also associated with augmented antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Although HLA-DR expression was not increased on either monocytes or lymphocytes, an increased capacity of both lymphocytes and monocytes to bind Mab 17-1A was observed. In all in vitro assays of ADCC, the presence of antibody excess was associated with improved cytolytic activity. In spite of the favorable modulation of cytolytic activity and improved ability of effector cells to bind Mab, we failed to demonstrated adequate clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma using this dose and schedule of interferon gamma and Mab 17-1A. Future trials will focus on alternate schedules of Mab 17-1A with the hope of improving tumor antigen saturation and circulating levels of infused antibody. \nTemporalis myofascial flap for maxillofacial reconstruction. To date, the temporalis myofascial flap has been used only to a limited extent for reconstruction in the maxillofacial region. Experience gained with 26 temporalis flaps in reconstruction of tissue defects in the periorbital region, skull base, maxilla, and oral cavity is presented. Only one patient developed total necrosis of the flap; significant necrosis did not occur in any other patient. The anatomy of the flap and surgical technique are briefly presented. \nLife-threatening angioedema. Angioedema is a well-recognized edema involving the deeper layers of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa. From July 1986 to July 1989 the authors have observed and treated 10 patients admitted to the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) Hospitals in Richmond, Virginia, with life-threatening angioedema as a complication of enalapril or captopril ingestion. Both drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prescribed for antihypertensive activity and the ability to improve symptoms in patients with congestive heart failure. We describe the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and management of these patients, as well as reasons for each occurrence. Sporadic reports of angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitor therapy have appeared in the literature. This represents the first time a significant series of patients from the same institution have encountered this complication over a short period of time, suggesting that the complication may be much more common than has been thought. \nAnnular atrophic lichen planus. We describe a case of generalized, asymptomatic, chronic annular lichen planus. The centers of the large annular lesions were atrophic and had lost their elasticity. Histologic examination revealed an absence of elastic fiber in the center. Electron microscopy revealed fragmented elastic fibers. Examination of early lesions showed that elastolysis had already begun in the heavy cellular infiltration. We conclude that the annular configuration resulted from the elastolytic activity of the inflammatory cells with the formation of foci of localized acquired cutis laxa. \nEffect of inspired oxygen concentration on the incidence of desaturation in patients undergoing total hip replacement. The effect of inspired oxygen concentration on the incidence of desaturation was studied in two groups of patients (n = 32 and 31) during total hip replacement. During insertion of acrylic bone cement, those patients receiving an inspired fractional oxygen concentration (FIO2) of 0.5 had less desaturation (3%) than those receiving an FIO2 of 0.33 (34%). \nRearrangement of the T-cell receptor delta chain gene in T-cell lymphomas with a mature phenotype. The configuration of the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta chain gene was assessed using restriction fragment analysis and the Southern blot technique in 39 T-cell lymphomas with a mature immunophenotype. The TCR delta gene was rearranged in four lymphomas although the gamma/delta TCR was not expressed in two cases studied. The TCR delta gene was the only TCR gene rearranged in two cases. Each lymphoma with TCR delta gene rearrangement had an aberrant T-cell immunophenotype and three cases were of the large cell anaplastic type. The TCR delta gene was deleted in 22 cases and was in the germline configuration in 13 lymphomas. Deletion of the TCR delta gene was characteristic of mycosis fungoides, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus positive), and Lennert's lymphoma, and was not identified in angiocentric lymphomas. In eight cases with TCR delta deletion, however, a large number of polyclonal (presumably reactive) T cells were present and, in these lymphomas, the authors could not determine if TCR delta gene deletion occurred in the polyclonal T cells, the neoplastic cells, or both cell populations. The authors conclude that the TCR delta gene is usually deleted in mature T-cell lymphomas, as would be expected in alpha/beta TCR T cells. However, TCR delta gene rearrangement is detectable in approximately 10% of cases. Analysis of this locus may be useful diagnostically, as it occasionally may be the only molecular marker of clonality in mature T-cell lymphomas T-cell receptor delta chain gene rearrangement also is found most often in lymphomas of the large cell anaplastic type. \nDisposition of high-dose methotrexate in an obese cancer patient. The disposition of many drugs in obesity is altered, although little is known of the effect of obesity on the pharmacokinetics of anti-cancer drugs. In this report the authors describe the pharmacokinetics of high-dose methotrexate in an obese woman (184% ideal body weight) with osteosarcoma. For this patient, both the volume of distribution at steady-state (0.398 l/kg) and systemic clearance (0.0956 l/h/kg) of methotrexate were increased compared with values observed in adult patients with osteosarcoma. The terminal elimination half-life (9.29 hours) of methotrexate was similar to other reported values in adult patients, thus indicating that increases in methotrexate volume of distribution and clearance may offset each other in obesity. Based on the experience gained from this patient, the authors suggest that renal function and methotrexate serum concentrations should be monitored in obese patients receiving high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue. \nThe clinical utility of maternal body mass index in pregnancy. To describe maternal body mass index and to compare the use of maternal weight and body mass index for risk assessment at the initial prenatal visit, 6270 gravid women who were consecutively delivered of infants were studied. Body mass index increased with advancing maternal age, parity, and advancing gestational age and was significantly greater in black women than in nonblack women. Risks for the development of adverse outcome associated with maternal obesity, including development of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, fetal macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia, were comparably predicted by either maternal weight or body mass index greater than 90th percentile. Maternal weight was as predictive of preeclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia as was body mass index when these factors were analyzed as continuous variables, whereas increasing body mass index was more predictive of gestational diabetes. The prediction of factors associated with low maternal weights, small-for-gestational-age birth, prematurity, low birth weight, and perinatal death was equivalent for maternal weight and body mass index that was less than 10th percentile. This study indicates that in the initial risk assessment of outcomes related to maternal weight, the calculation of maternal body mass index offers no advantage over simply weighing the patient. This finding contrasts with results in nonpregnant women. \nGlutethimide treatment of disabling action tremor in patients with multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Glutethimide has been used to control essential tremor. Its efficacy in the treatment of disabling cerebellar and rubral tremor was assessed in an open study of six patients with multiple sclerosis and two patients with traumatic brain injury. Functional and quantitative tremor severity was assessed before treatment and 7 to 14 days after a stable dose was achieved. Six of eight patients exhibited visible functional benefit from treatment with glutethimide; abstract testing results correlated well with functional status in most cases. Four patients chose to continue to receive medication. Controlled trials of glutethimide to compare its efficacy with that of other medications used in the treatment of action tremor are indicated. \nAging, autonomic function, and the perception of angina. OBJECTIVE--To determine the effects of age and autonomic function on the perception of angina. DESIGN--Prospective evaluation of the relations between anginal perceptual threshold, autonomic function, and systolic blood pressure in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease. Statistical analysis was by non-parametric techniques. SETTING--Cardiology departments of a district general hospital and a post-graduate teaching centre. SUBJECTS--82 non-diabetic men with typical exertional angina and coronary artery disease confirmed by arteriography (n = 64) or a history of Q wave infarction (n = 18). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age, anginal perceptual threshold, autonomic function, and blood pressure. Anginal perceptual threshold was defined as the time from onset of 0.1 mV ST depression to the onset of angina during treadmill stress testing. Autonomic function was measured as the ratio of peak heart rate during the Valsalva manoeuvre to the minimum rate after release. RESULTS--Anginal perceptual threshold showed a weak but significant correlation with age, with older patients tending to have a longer interval between the onset of ST depression and the onset of angina. Comparison of patients in the upper and lower quartile age ranges showed a difference of 50 seconds between median threshold measurements. Blood pressure and heart rate responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre also correlated with age, but neither variable correlated with the anginal perceptual threshold. CONCLUSIONS--In non-diabetic men with coronary artery disease the perception of angina tends to deteriorate with advancing age. The mechanism is unclear but is not attributable solely to alterations in blood pressure or autonomic function. \nColitis due to Histoplasma capsulatum in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. We present a case of colonic histoplasmosis in a young HIV antibody-positive homosexual male who presented with acute diarrhea. The diagnosis was made by flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy which revealed organisms morphologically consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum, and was later confirmed by fungal culture of the biopsy specimens. At colonoscopy, skip areas with plaques, ulcers, and a pseudopolyp were observed. The colitis resolved endoscopically after a 6-wk course of intravenous amphotericin B, and the patient has had no recurrence of symptoms while on maintenance therapy with amphotericin B. However, the organisms continue to be noted on biopsies of normal-appearing areas in the rectum and sigmoid 5 months after diagnosis. Colonic involvement with H. capsulatum, an organism endemic to the Midwest, may be seen more frequently as the total number of cases of HIV-infected individuals increases in this region. \nA critical look at scheduled relaparotomy for secondary bacterial peritonitis. Scheduled relaparotomy is attracting interest as a means of treating intra-abdominal sepsis. It is the subject of several studies to evaluate its role in the management of peritoneal infection. However, indications for this procedure are not clear and current knowledge does not allow for adequate scientific evaluation. Many trials lack control groups and historical control groups cannot be evaluated on criteria, such as illness severity, concomitant health problems or even surgical technique. Indicators of outcome are generally described in insufficient detail; only death or survival are reported and important morbidity and resource utilization data are not included. A randomized, prospective, multicenter clinical trial using standardized techniques is necessary to determine the usefulness of scheduled relaparotomy performed on different patients. \nAcute pulpal-alveolar cellulitis syndrome. V. Apical closure of immature teeth by infection control: the importance of an endodontic seal with therapeutic factors. Part 2. During orthodontic treatment to promote eruption of maxillary and mandibular second bicuspids, a young male patient had a severe endodontic cellulitis of a mandibular bicuspid. Apexogenesis and resolution of the periapical lesion was achieved by infection control with nonspecific intracanal medication without calcium hydroxide, as stated by Das. A mild periodontal cellulitis occurred shortly thereafter and rapidly resolved. A second endodontic cellulitis, after apexogenesis without an endodontic seal, occurred shortly after completion of orthodontic treatment. This also quickly resolved, and the canal was effectively sealed. This case indicates the importance of an effective endodontic seal shortly after apexogenesis is induced by infection control. This report and others on the subject indicate that apexogenesis of nonvital permanent immature teeth by infection control is a predictable endodontic treatment procedure. \nProgress in cancer. Definite progress has been made against cancer since the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971. Physicians are giving increased attention to cancer prevention. The exciting changes in molecular biology provide increased knowledge about basic mechanisms in tumor growth and metastases. Detailed discussions of two common solid cancers--breast and colorectal--attest to continuing advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment. All of these augur well for further progress in oncology. Continued research, basic and clinical, is mandatory. \nCharacterization of refractory period extension by transcardiac shock. BACKGROUND. To better understand the refractory period extension (RPE) produced by transcardiac shocks and its possible role in defibrillation, we measured RPE under various experimental conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using ventricular pacing in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, we characterized RPE in relation to the anatomic site of pacing, the local voltage gradient (LVG) produced by the shocks at the pacing site, and the pacing rate and pacing current used to make the measurements. We also determined if RPE persisted into the next refractory period after the shock and measured RPE at the end of 30-second episodes of acute ischemia to the pacing site, which were caused by occluding the left anterior descending artery. Each anatomic site tested showed RPE, which increased sharply with increasing LVG at lower levels but less sharply at higher LVG. The RPE versus LVG was approximated with an exponential curve that had an exponential constant of about 5-6 V/cm. At faster pacing rates, RPE occurred earlier in the refractory period but was unchanged when expressed as a percent increase of refractory period. RPE did not vary with the pacing current and was present only in the refractory period during which the shock was delivered. The RPE was not significantly altered by acute ischemia. These results show that transcardiac shocks selectively extend the refractory period of tissue proportional to the LVG and the timing of the shock in the refractory period. They are consistent with the concept that RPE prevents depolarization from tissue directly excited by a shock from propagating to tissue that was refractory to that same shock. CONCLUSIONS. The insensitivity of RPE to short ischemic episodes and the presence of RPE at increased activation rates suggest that RPE might exist under conditions of fibrillation and be a major determinant of the success or failure of defibrillation. \nA prospective study of maturity-onset diabetes mellitus and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in women. We examined the relationship of maturity-onset clinical diabetes mellitus with the subsequent incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke, total cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in a cohort of 116,177 US women who were 30 to 55 years of age and free of known coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer in 1976. During 8 years of follow-up (889 255 person-years), we identified 338 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 111 coronary deaths, 259 strokes, 238 cardiovascular deaths, and 1349 deaths from all causes. Diabetes was associated with a markedly increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (age-adjusted relative risk [RR] = 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3 to 8.4), ischemic stroke (RR = 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3 to 9.0), total cardiovascular mortality (RR = 6.3; 95% CI, 4.6 to 8.6), and all-cause mortality (RR = 3.0; 95% CI, 2.5 to 3.7). A major independent effect of diabetes persisted in multivariate analyses after simultaneous control for other known coronary risk factors (for these end points, RR [95% CI] = 3.1 [2.3 to 4.2], 3.0 [1.6 to 5.7], 3.0 [1.9 to 4.8], and 1.9 [1.4 to 2.4], respectively). The absolute excess coronary risk due to diabetes was greater in the presence of other risk factors, including cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity. These prospective data indicate that maturity-onset clinical diabetes is a strong determinant of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular mortality among middle-aged women. The adverse effect of diabetes is amplified in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, many of which are modifiable. \nAcute effects of pulsatile levodopa administration on central dopamine pharmacodynamics. Inconsistencies in the response to individual levodopa doses occur in most patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate the possible development of acute tachyphylaxis, we evaluated the effects of repeated injections of intravenous levodopa in 10 PD patients with motor fluctuations by administering, during a single day, a previously determined optimal levodopa dose repeatedly each time motor function returned to baseline. Peak antiparkinsonian response was lower by 20%, and peak plasma levodopa levels lower by 35% following the first dose compared with all subsequent doses. Neither peak dyskinesia scores nor the duration of motor response changed significantly with successive levodopa doses. These data suggest that pulsatile levodopa administration does not acutely alter dopamine receptor responsiveness, and that other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors contribute to the dose-to-dose variability in response to levodopa. \nThe Edmonton injector: a simple device for patient-controlled subcutaneous analgesia. In a prospective open study we tested the Edmonton injector (EI), a device designed by our group for subcutaneous injection of narcotics. In 25 patients, the EI was used for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA); mean duration of treatment was 28 +/- 10 days. Mean equivalent daily dose of morphine was 160 +/- 85 mg. All patients found the EI safe and simple to operate. The main reason for discontinuation was death (10 cases) or return to oral narcotics (8 cases). In 20 patients who were admitted to the hospital and were too ill to learn PCA, the EI was used for regular s.c. administration by nurses. Narcotics were administered every 4 h and extra doses were administered on a 'PRN' basis. Waiting time for a 'PRN' dose in 8 patients before starting the EI was 18 +/- 7 min; after the EI was started, it was 3 +/- 4 min (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the EI is safe, effective and inexpensive, and that it will be particularly useful in smaller hospitals and developing countries. \nKinetics of D-xylose absorption in patients with human immunodeficiency virus enteropathy. D-Xylose absorption was studied in 12 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or advanced AIDS-related complex who had had diarrhea for more than 8 weeks, averaged an 11% (range, 3% to 21%) body weight loss during the previous 6 months, and had had negative stool examinations for enteric pathogens. Patients were evaluated by duodenal aspiration and biopsy and received both 25 gm oral and 10 gm intravenous doses of D-xylose. Kinetic analysis of D-xylose absorption was characterized by an absorption rate constant (ka) and a rate constant (ko) reflecting nonabsorptive loss. Extent of D-xylose absorption averaged 18.4% +/- 9.3% (+/- SD) in the 12 patients (normal greater than 60%). Percentage of weight loss during the previous 6 months was negatively correlated with ka (r = -0.69; p = 0.018) in the 11 patients in whom this parameter was reduced but was not correlated with either ko or extent of D-xylose absorption. In these patients with human immunodeficiency virus enteropathy, ka was reduced out of proportion to the minor histologic changes present in the duodenal biopsy specimens. \nStrawberry hemangioma of infancy: early definitive treatment with an argon laser. This report documents the successful treatment of a hemangioma (strawberry hemangioma) at 5 weeks of age with the argon laser. The natural course of strawberry hemangioma of infancy is well known. It begins as a very small spot and develops very rapidly within the first few weeks of life. Many grow to a very large size and produce significant morbidity. It is logical to assume that if these were ablated early, the life cycle could be aborted. The patient of this case study developed two spots that appeared to be typical evolving hemangiomas. One was treated and disappeared. The other was not treated and evolved into a typical strawberry hemangioma that eventually involuted. This would indicate that early treatment holds some promise. \nCytomegalovirus ileitis presenting as massive rectal bleeding in infancy. Two Zambian infants presented with massive rectal bleeding caused by cytomegalovirus ileitis. The first was seropositive for HIV and the second seronegative, though her mother was seropositive. Both infants died. \nOccult metastatic neck disease: detection with US and US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology. The authors performed a prospective study of the value of ultrasonography (US) and US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for assessment of N0 lesions in the neck. Preoperative US was performed in 107 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who underwent 132 elective neck dissections. During the US examination of the last 54 patients, who underwent 70 elective neck dissections, US-guided FNAC was performed. US alone was found to be an unreliable method for detecting occult lymph node metastasis; the accuracy never exceeded 70% (93 of 132), with a sensitivity of 60% (32 of 53) and a specificity of 77% (61 of 79). In contrast, US-guided FNAC had an accuracy of 89% (62 of 70), a sensitivity of 76% (25 of 33), and a specificity of 100% (37 of 37). Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of US-guided FNAC for the assessment of the N0 neck, this modality may play an important role in directing treatment of these patients in the future. \nElectrocardiographic findings in a patient with pure septal infarction. The electrocardiogram in a 65 year old man in whom pure septal infarction had been produced by occlusion of the septal branch during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty showed that this had led to the disappearance of septal Q waves and reciprocal ST segment depression in the inferior leads. \nAcute, subacute, and chronic myocardial infarction: quantitative analysis of gadolinium-enhanced MR images. The value of gadolinium enhancement to enable detection of infarcted myocardium at T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was assessed in 84 patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Five healthy subjects served as controls. All patients underwent MR imaging before and 20 minutes after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Contrast enhancement of normal myocardium varied 7% +/- 4 after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Mean intensity ratio after gadolinium enhancement in group 1 (imaging less than 1 week after AMI), group 2 (imaging 1-3 weeks after AMI), and group 3 (imaging 3-6 weeks after AMI) was significantly higher than before gadolinium enhancement. In group 4 (imaging more than 6 weeks after AMI), no significant difference was observed. After gadolinium enhancement, the intensity ratio was abnormally increased in 82% of the MR examinations in group 1, in 62% of group 2, in 58% of group 3, and in 12% of group 4. Gadolinium enhancement improved visualization of myocardial infarction at MR imaging up to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms and had a maximal effect within 1 week after AMI. \nAnalyses of 200 lymphadenectomies in patients with penile carcinoma. From 1972 to 1987, 200 consecutive lymphadenectomies were performed in 112 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. A Gibson incision provided exposure of the iliac and inguinal lymph nodes with a low morbidity rate (5% flap necrosis, 15% wound infection, 16% lymphedema and 9% lymphocele). The controversy surrounding the necessity of iliac lymphadenectomy is discussed, since 305 iliac lymph nodes examined did not have metastatic invasion. \nRelationship between the onset of dysmenorrhea and histologic findings in adenomyosis. An attempt was made to evaluate the relationship between histologic findings of adenomyosis and onset of dysmenorrhea. Thirty-four cases of histologically diagnosed adenomyosis were investigated in this study. One large sample cut along the longitudinal axis was made and examined to evaluate the histologic parameters and CA 125 levels. Dysmenorrhea was classified into grade I (absent or mild) and grade II (severe). Localization of adenomyosis was divided into type I, adenomyosis continuous from the surface endometrium (29 cases), and type II, adenomyosis present on the serous side of the uterus and not continuous from the surface endometrium (five cases). We made type I adenomyosis, which included 13 cases of grade I and 16 cases of grade II, the focus of our investigation. The parameters that correlated with dysmenorrhea were the number of islands of adenomyosis and glands, distance of invasion, relative rate of invasion, and CA 125 levels. The differences between grades I and II were apparent in the frequency distribution tables, with dysmenorrhea occurring at invasion rates of 80% and greater. \nImmunohistochemical detection of renal carbonic anhydrase of patients with recurrent urolithiasis. In renal exploratory excisions the isoenzyme C of the carbonic anhydrase was detected in 51 operative treated patients with recurrent urolithiasis and in 6 patients with ren mobilis or stenosis of the ureteral pelvic junction by using the immunohistochemical PAP-method. In the distal tubules and collecting ducts there is an alternating occurrence of cells with small and those with strong reactivity. This correlates with the distribution of mean or principal (P-, small reaction) and intercalated (I-, strong reaction) cells. The number of carbonic anhydrase rich cells and the degree of their cytoplasmic reaction to this enzyme seem to correlate with the ability of the urine to acidify. The patients were divided into four groups according to the mean urine pH estimated for a period of two weeks. The third group with predominantly acid urine (pH less than 5.8) showed a significantly increased number of carbonic anhydrase rich cells (mean = 63% +/- 6, n = 18) as compared to the first group (controls) without urolithiasis and normal urine (pH 5.8-6.8, mean = 46% +/- 8, n = 6) or the second group with urolithiasis and normal urine (pH 5.8-6.8, mean = 46% +/- 8, n = 28). The fourth group with predominant alkaline urine (pH greater than 6.8) showed a significantly decreased number of intercalated cells (mean = 42% +/- 16, n = 5) in comparison to the third group. Indeed, the difference with the control group is not significant but the cytoplasmic reaction of I-cells decreases distinctly in comparison to all other groups. \nAcute traumatic midbrain hemorrhage: experimental and clinical observations with CT. Traumatic brain stem hemorrhage (TBH) after blunt head impact is an uncommon injury and has historically been associated with high mortality. Retrospective clinical review identified 64 patients with TBH admitted during a 5-year period. Complete imaging and clinical records for 45 of these patients demonstrated that TBH could be categorized into three groups. The most frequent site of hemorrhage, in 31 (69%) of 45 patients (group 1), was the midline rostral anterior brain stem, posterior to the interpeduncular cistern, and this injury was associated with a 71% survival rate. This pattern was also associated with a predominantly anterior site of head and/or face impact. Eight (18%) patients (group 2) had miscellaneous foci of acute brain stem hemorrhage with seven (88%) surviving. Six (13%) patients (group 3) had brain stem hemorrhage associated with transtentorial herniation and brain stem compression, with 100% mortality. Experimental findings in a canine model and clinical results indicate that the anterior rostral midbrain is a common site of TBH and appears to arise from sudden craniocaudal displacement of the brain at impact. Survival is unexpected high with this location of traumatic midbrain hemorrhage. \nIntrinsic vasculature of the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve--implications for site of lesion in Bell's palsy. Recent studies of the intrinsic vasculature of the cat facial nerve have demonstrated relatively poor blood supply to the labyrinthine segment. In this study, the intrinsic vasculature of the human facial nerve was systematically evaluated in 25 temporal bones and three fresh cadaver nerves. Cross-sectional vessel counts were obtained for the labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid segments. Capillary densities for each segment were derived from these data. The labyrinthine segment of the human facial nerve, like that in the cat, contains fewer and smaller intrinsic blood vessels than do the mastoid and tympanic segments. This may indicate that the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve may be more vulnerable to ischemic damage. In conjunction with the previously demonstrated narrowness of the labyrinthine fallopian canal, these findings support the contention that the labyrinthine segment is a likely site of lesion in Bell's palsy. \nThallium-201 scintigraphy after intravenous infusion of adenosine compared with exercise thallium testing in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease Adenosine is an endogenously produced compound that has significant effects as a coronary and systemic vasodilator. Previous studies suggest that intravenous infusion of adenosine, coupled with thallium-201 scintigraphy, may have specific value as a noninvasive means of evaluating coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of adenosine thallium testing with that of standard exercise thallium testing. One hundred subjects were studied with exercise thallium imaging and thallium imaging after adenosine infusion, including 47 with angiographically proved coronary artery disease and 53 control subjects. The overall sensitivity of the thallium procedures was 81% for the exercise study and 83% for the adenosine study (p = NS); the specificity was 74% for the exercise study and 75% for the adenosine study (p = NS). The diagnostic accuracy of the exercise study was 77% and that of the adenosine study was 79%. Ninety-four percent of subjects had an adverse effect due to the adenosine infusion; however, most of these effects were mild and well tolerated. All adverse effects abated within 30 to 45 s of the termination of the study, consistent with the very brief half-life of the agent. Thus, thallium-201 scintigraphy after intravenous infusion of adenosine has a diagnostic value similar to that of exercise thallium testing for evaluation of coronary artery disease. Adenosine thallium testing may be particularly useful in evaluating patients unable to perform treadmill exercise testing. \nRetroperitoneal fibrosis. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is idiopathic in two thirds of cases and is found most commonly as an isolated fibrotic plaque centered over the lower lumbar spine and entrapping one or both ureters. It has been postulated that the fibrosis in the idiopathic cases results from a hypersensitivity reaction to antigens leaking into the retroperitoneum from atheromatous plaques in the aorta or common iliac arteries. In the remaining one third of cases, causes include ergot-derivative drugs, retroperitoneal hemorrhage or urine extravasation, and a desmoplastic response to a variety of tumors. In up to 15% of cases, associated fibrotic processes are found elsewhere in the body. Although the disease is imaged best with CT or MR, neither of these techniques can be used to differentiate benign from malignant plaques. Histologically, the disease is characterized in its early stages by inflammatory cells and edema in a loose collagen network. The mature plaque is composed of dense fibrous tissue with minimal cellular infiltration. This progression is important as it influences MR signal characteristics. \nInfluence of the plasma protein concentration on renal function. 1. The effect of the plasma protein concentration on renal function remains controversial. Most, but not all, experimental studies suggest that a reduced plasma protein concentration perfusing the kidney may reduce tubular sodium reabsorption. Hypoproteinaemic disease states are usually associated with sodium retention, which is not always volume-dependent. 2. We induced a 21% and 24% reduction in plasma total protein and plasma albumin, respectively, in unanaesthetized sheep by acute extracorporeal plasmapheresis. Arterial pressure did not change, and changes in circulatory volume were minimised by infusion of crystalloid to maintain pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, measured using a Swann-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter. 3. After plasmapheresis, there was no significant change in creatinine clearance, sodium excretion, plasma renin activity or urinary kallikrein excretion. 4. After plasmapheresis, there was no significant reduction in plasma osmolality, increase in urine osmolality and fall in free water clearance. 5. The results suggest that in the absence of detectable changes in circulating volume or arterial pressure, acute hypoproteinaemia is associated with significant changes in renal water handling, but has no direct effect on sodium excretion or on renal release of renin and kallikrein. \nEffect of high-dose methylprednisolone and U74006F on eicosanoid synthesis after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats. Free radicals and lipid peroxidation of membrane fatty acids are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of arterial vasospasm and the physiopathologic patterns of neuronal damage after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We have evaluated the effects of treatment with either high-dose methylprednisolone every 8 hours or a single dose of U74006F on the temporal profile of ex vivo synthesis of four selected eicosanoids in brain slices after experimental induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats. Prostaglandins D2 and E2, prostacyclin and leukotriene C4 levels were determined by radioimmunoassay after 1-hour incubation of the brain slices. The synthesis of prostaglandin D2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha at 48 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage was significantly higher when compared to sham-operated animals (p = 0.01); prostaglandin E2 release was significantly enhanced at 6 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage (p = 0.01). The release of the lipoxygenase metabolite was significantly enhanced at 1, 6, and 48 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage induction. Both treatment regimens significantly reduced the ex vivo synthesis of prostaglandin D2, prostaglandin E2, and leukotriene C4 at 1, 6, and 48 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage, whereas the effects on 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha synthesis differed in the two treatment groups. U74006F enhanced the synthesis of prostacyclin metabolite in the early phase after subarachnoid hemorrhage, and high-dose methylprednisolone reduced the increasing synthesis at 48 hours. A strict comparison between the two treatments was not possible because of the different modalities of administration. However, these data suggest that the antioxidant effect of single-dose treatment with U74006F influenced the early and delayed effects on enzymatic lipid peroxidation, whereas the effects of methylprednisolone administration every 8 hours were more significant in the delayed phase. \nBrain and ocular abnormalities in infants with in utero exposure to cocaine and other street drugs. We describe 10 infants with developmental delay and congenital cerebral anomalies who were found to have had in utero exposure to vasoactive drugs. Nine infants had ophthalmological abnormalities; these included strabismus, nystagmus, and/or hypoplastic optic discs. Six mothers used cocaine, one used cocaine and heroin, one used only heroin, one used amphetamine, and one used phenylpropanolamine. Each of these cerebral anomalies (agenesis of the corpus callosum, septo-optic dysplasia, schizencephaly, hydranencephaly, congenital hydrocephalus, porencephaly, and cerebral infarctions) can be attributed to insults at different stages of development. There appears to be a relationship between the time of prenatal drug exposure and the type of cerebral anomaly, evoking malformations, disruptions, or fetal strokes. Since many or possibly all of these anomalies are thought to have a vascular origin, it seems appropriate to implicate prenatal exposure to vasoactive drugs. \nReflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome of the lower limbs in renal transplant patients treated with cyclosporin A. In a 36-month period, 240 patients at our institution received kidney transplants from cadaver donors. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was used as the initial immunosuppressive therapy. Seven patients (5 men and 2 women) developed severe pain, periarticular soft tissue swelling with no effusion, and vasomotor changes in affected areas. Although articular mobility was conserved, most of the patients had great difficulty in walking. A patchy osteoporotic pattern was seen radiographically and increased uptake of 99mtechnetium with a periarticular distribution in the clinically affected areas were found. All of these symptoms and radiographic and scintigraphic signs are compatible with definite reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS). Articular symptoms began within 3 months after kidney transplantation in all patients; all but 1 patient had plasma CsA levels greater than 200 ng/ml at that time. When the dosage of CsA was reduced, there was concomitant improvement in the RSDS, which appeared when the plasma CsA levels declined to less than 200 ng/ml. The mean duration of the clinical symptoms of RSDS was 8 months. We believe RSDS should be added to the list of complications that may appear in kidney transplant patients who receive CsA treatment. \nCoronary hemodynamic effects of atrial natriuretic peptide in humans. Studies of the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide on the coronary circulation have yielded conflicting results in animals and have not been fully investigated in human subjects. To further characterize the direct coronary hemodynamic actions of atrial natriuretic peptide in humans and to assess the safety of its administration in patients with coronary artery disease, incremental doses of synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide and nitroglycerin were infused into the left coronary artery in 14 patients, 11 of whom had coronary artery disease. Both agents caused dose-related increases in total coronary sinus blood flow. The largest dose of atrial natriuretic peptide given to all patients (100 micrograms) increased mean coronary sinus blood flow from 127 +/- 7 to 149 +/- 9 ml/min (p less than 0.05) and decreased coronary vascular resistance from 0.93 +/- 0.07 to 0.81 +/- 0.05 mm Hg/ml per min (p less than 0.05); mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were not affected by this dose of atrial natriuretic peptide. The greatest changes in coronary sinus blood flow (+25%) and coronary vascular resistance (-18%) after atrial natriuretic peptide administration occurred in the patients with coronary artery disease and no other associated cardiovascular disease. The maximal effects of atrial natriuretic peptide were similar to those of nitroglycerin, and no untoward effects were observed. Thus, atrial natriuretic peptide is a direct coronary vasodilator in humans. Its maximal dose effects are similar to those of nitroglycerin and were well tolerated in this small group of patients. The physiologic importance and therapeutic potential of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with coronary artery disease merit further investigation. \nSouthern blot analysis in a case of Richter's syndrome. Evidence for a postrearrangement heavy chain gene deletion associated with the altered phenotype. Richter's syndrome (RS) can be defined as the emergence of an aggressive lymphoma in patients suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The authors performed immunophenotypic and Southern blot analysis of the peripheral blood and tissue specimen of a patient with RS. Using immunoperoxidase and immunogold-silver staining techniques and a panel of monoclonal antibodies, the authors found that the large cells characteristic of RS showed an altered immunophenotype as compared with the CLL cells and did not express mu heavy chain. Southern blot analysis revealed identical kappa light chain rearrangements in both tumoral cell populations consistent with a common clonal origin. Using the JH probe and several restriction enzymes, the authors also found evidence for a postrearrangement deletion of the heavy chain mu gene. These findings suggest that in this case of RS, a deletion of the heavy chain mu gene resulted in loss of mu expression by the larger cells that were characteristic of RS and was associated with their altered phenotype. \nDevelopment of a highly efficient expression cDNA cloning system: application to oncogene isolation. We developed an expression cDNA cloning system capable of generating high-complexity libraries with unidirectionally inserted cDNA fragments and allowing efficient plasmid rescue. As an application of this system, a cDNA library was constructed from an NIH 3T3 transformant induced by mouse hepatocellular carcinoma DNA. Transfection of NIH 3T3 cells by the library DNA led to the detection of several transformed foci from which identical plasmids with transforming ability could be rescued. Structure and sequence analysis of the cDNA clones revealed that the oncogene was created by recombinational events involving an unknown gene and the mouse homologue of the B-raf protooncogene. Detection of the same genetic rearrangement in independent primary transformants implied that generation of the oncogene occurred within the tumor rather than during DNA transfection or cDNA library construction. The high frequency at which clones were identified and the large sizes of some of the transforming cDNA inserts isolated suggest wide applicability of this mammalian expression cloning system for isolating cDNAs of biologic interest. \nImmunophenotyping of lymphocytes in liver tissue of patients with chronic liver diseases by flow cytometry. Immunological factors are important in the pathogenesis of a spectrum of hepatobiliary diseases. To characterize the nature of specific immunological responses in liver disease, we determined lymphocyte changes in liver tissue and in blood using flow cytometry. A total of 113 liver biopsy specimens was collected from patients with the following diseases: 19 chronic hepatitis B; 39 chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis; 27 alcoholic liver disease; 10 hepatic malignancy; 8 autoimmune hepatitis; 6 fatty liver and 4 primary biliary cirrhosis. The lymphocytes were isolated from the liver biopsy specimens by mechanical and enzymatic methods. The lymphocyte yield was 7,901 +/- 575 cells/mg of liver tissue. The viability of lymphocytes was 97.7% +/- 0.3%. Lymphocytes were stained with four pairs of two-color mixed fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies, including T4-T8 (CD4/CD8), T11-B1 (CD2-CD20), NKH1-T8 (CD56-CD8), IL-2R1-T11 (CD25-CD2), and the ratios were determined by an Epics Profile flow cytometer. Immunophenotyping of lymphocytes in whole blood samples was simultaneously analyzed. Variability in lymphocyte yield and different patterns of lymphocyte subsets were found in the liver biopsy specimens. The yields of lymphocytes from patients with chronic non-A, non-B and autoimmune hepatitis were highest, and the lowest yield was from patients with fatty liver. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, fatty liver and hepatic malignancy had relatively high ratios of CD4/CD8, CD56/CD8 and CD25/CD2; whereas patients with chronic hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis and non-A, non-B hepatitis had lower ratios of CD4/CD8, CD56/CD8 and CD25/CD2. No difference in lymphocyte ratios between the patients with cirrhotic and noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease was found. \nRelationship between esophageal varices and azygos vein evaluated by cineportography. The relationship between esophageal varices and the azygos vein, which is generally considered to drain the major part of the variceal blood flow, was evaluated by percutaneous transhepatic cineportography in 35 patients with portal hypertension. We classified the patients into three groups. Those patients in whom most of the variceal blood drained into the azygos vein were designated the azygos-type group (n = 18). Those in whom most of the blood flowed into the brachiocephalic venous system were defined as the cervical-type group (n = 5), and those in whom the varices were drained by both the azygos vein and the brachiocephalic venous system were called the combined-type group (n = 12). Highly developed esophageal varices were recognized endoscopically in all patients in the combined-type and cervical-type groups, whereas some of the patients in the azygos-type group had less well-developed varices. In the azygos-type group, a tendency for the varices to be more severe as their drainage into the azygos vein became more cephalad was noted. Evaluation of the drainage of esophageal varices was considered useful not only for obtaining full comprehension of the significance of the azygos vein but also for assessing the suitability for sclerotherapy. Percutaneous transhepatic cineportography was useful for this purpose because it enables visualization of even the most minute amounts of blood flow. \nProspective quality-of-life analysis after palliative photoablation for the treatment of malignant dysphagia. Forty patients were treated for the relief of malignant dysphagia by using laser photoablation. Their quality of life was assessed before the start of treatment and at monthly intervals until death. Two methods were used, a physician's assessment (QL index) and a patient's self-assessment, the linear analogue self-assessment (LASA). There was significant correlation between assessments done at different times by different physicians (QL index rs, 0.786; P less than 0.001; LASA rs, 0.865; P less than 0.001). The correlation coefficient of the QL index and the LASA score with the patient's dysphagia grade was 0.459 and 0.336, respectively. The patient's swallowing ability, QL index, and LASA all were improved significantly at some time after laser therapy. The mean survival was 16 weeks with 58% of patients dying at home, 28% in the hospital, and 18% in a hospice. It was concluded that laser photoablation improves the overall quality of life in patients with malignant dysphagia. \nIntra-arterial streptokinase infusion in acute lower limb ischaemia. Between 1986 and 1988, 38 patients (29 men and nine women), median age 65 years (range 38-85 years), underwent local intra-arterial streptokinase therapy for acute lower limb ischaemia. Three patient groups were identified: 15 with acute on chronic ischaemia (group 1), 12 postangioplasty (group 2) and 11 postfemorodistal bypass (group 3). Distal arteriographic run-off was a significant discriminant between success and failure in group 1 (n = 15, chi 2 = 11.5, P = 0.001) and in the overall group (n = 38, chi 2 = 17.2, P less than 0.001). In group 2, four patients with good run-off had an unsuccessful outcome; this was due in all cases to technical problems (haemorrhage in two and intimal dissection in two). In group 3, two patients with good run-off had unsuccessful streptokinase infusions. In both cases the graft failed in the early postoperative period (less than 30 days). By contrast, the four patients whose grafts occluded after 30 days had successful streptokinase infusions and long-term graft patency was achieved by further surgery and balloon dilatation. In all groups, no patient with a poor run-off had a successful outcome following streptokinase administration. The role of local intra-arterial streptokinase therapy in the critically ischaemic limb re",
