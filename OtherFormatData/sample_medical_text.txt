Dr. Sarah Johnson, a leading oncologist, diagnosed the patient, John Smith, with lung cancer after a series of diagnostic tests. CT scans and a biopsy confirmed the presence of a malignant tumor in the upper lobe of the right lung. The recommended treatment plan includes chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Etoposide, followed by a potential surgical resection if the tumor shrinks sufficiently. The patient has a history of hypertension and was previously prescribed Lisinopril. His family history reveals that his mother had breast cancer and his father suffered from diabetes mellitus.
