        "text": " effects that neoplastic astrocytes may have on the endothelial cells within malignant astrocytomas. In this study, the hypothesis that humoral factors elaborated by cells derived from malignant astrocytomas induce transformational changes in normal endothelial cells in vitro is investigated. Conditioned medium (CM) was prepared from exponentially growing cultures of a human glioblastoma cell line (UW18) and from two rat brain-tumor cell lines: an anaplastic astrocytoma (R175A) and a glioblastoma with sarcomatous elements (9L). Subconfluent target bovine aortic arch endothelial cells (BAEC's) were exposed for 48 hours to varying concentrations of CM prepared from each of these tumors, and then evaluated for transformational changes. Different molecular weight (MW) fractions of UW18 CM were prepared by molecular ultrafiltration, and each fraction was tested for transforming activity. Transformation endpoints included changes in cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) content and distribution (measured by differential flow cytometry) and changes in de novo DNA synthesis determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Significant changes in the amount and distribution of DNA and RNA were observed in the BAEC's treated with UW18 CM compared to untreated BAEC's. At 10% concentrations of UW18 CM, changes in the RNA profile of target BAEC's were evident, and at 30% concentrations of UW18 CM, an irregular bimodal distribution was well established. Patterns of DNA were also altered in a concentration-dependent manner, with significant aneuploidy developing at UW18 CM concentrations of 20%. The DNA synthesis in BAEC's increased with increasing CM concentrations, up to a maximum of about 250% of control values at 30% concentrations of UW18 CM. The transformational changes induced after exposure of BAEC's to CM prepared from R175A and 9L were significantly less than those observed with UW18 CM. Molecular ultrafiltration was used to prepare UW18 CM fractions with MW cutoffs of less than 10 kD, 10 to 30 kD, and greater than 30 kD. Transformational activity was significant only in CM's with an MW of 10 to 30 kD. It is concluded that the UW18 human glioblastoma cell line elaborates a soluble factor, or group of factors, with an MW in the 10- to 30-kD range, capable of inducing transformational alterations in target normal endothelial cells, and that such transformation may account for some of the abnormal endothelial cell changes associated with malignant astrocytomas. \nClinical decision making of critical care nurses managing computer-simulated tachydysrhythmias. The purposes of this study were to describe the clinical decision making of critical care nurses managing computer-simulated tachydysrhythmias and to assess the major sources of error related to the management of two tachydysrhythmias: atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. In this descriptive study, 142 critical care nurses each completed four computerized clinical simulations (two atrial flutter and two ventricular tachycardia). Simulation performance was measured by proficiency score (comparison with expert performance), patient outcome (cure or die), and amount of data collected before the first intervention. Mean proficiency scores were 51% for atrial flutter and 35% for ventricular tachycardia. Thirteen percent of the atrial flutter and 35% of the ventricular tachycardia simulations ended in patient death. Failure to recognize ventricular tachycardia and unfamiliarity with second- and third-line treatments were major sources of error. Medication errors were the cause of death in 87% of the simulations ending in patient death. These results document the need for emphasis on dysrhythmia management in the critical care curriculum. \nHomologous desensitization of the insulinotropic glucagon-like peptide-I (7-37) receptor on insulinoma (HIT-T15) cells. Glucagon-like peptide-I(7-37) [GLP-I(7-37)] is an intestinal peptide with potent insulinotropic activities on pancreatic beta-cells in vivo and in vitro. In earlier studies elevated concentrations GLP-I(7-37) inhibited insulin release and cAMP generation in beta-cells. We now show that the GLP-I(7-37) receptor in the glucose-responsive B-cell line HIT-T15 undergoes rapid and reversible homologous desensitization in response to supraphysiological concentrations of GLP-I(7-37). GLP-I(7-37) stimulated insulin release and cAMP generation in a glucose-dependent biphasic manner with a maximum stimulation at 10 nmol/liter. The first-phase insulin secretory response was reduced by 41% at doses of GLP-I(7-37) of 100 nmol/liter and higher. Preperifusion of B-cells with 100 nmol/liter GLP-I(7-37) for 5 or 10 min reduced a subsequent insulin secretory response to 10 nmol/liter GLP-I(7-37) after hormone washout and recovery periods of 10 min (52% and 55% reduction) or 30 min (33% reduction or full recovery). Preperifusion of HIT-T15 cells with 100 nmol/liter glucagon (10 min) or 100 nmol/liter gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) (10 min) had no effect on the insulin secretory response to 10 nmol/liter GLP-(7-37). Prior exposure of cells to 100 nmol/liter GLP-(7-37) (10 min) did not alter the GIP-induced (10 nmol/liter) insulin release, but 100 nmol/liter GIP (10 min) reduced the insulin secretion during stimulation with 10 nmol/liter GIP by 56%. These data indicate that: 1) the GLP-I(7-37) receptor is subject to rapid and reversible homologous desensitization and, 2) the GLP-I(7-37) receptor on beta-cells is distinct from that of GIP. The recent finding of elevated GLP-I(7-36)amide levels in subjects with noninsulin-dependent diabetes suggest the possibility that a homologous desensitization of the GLP-I(7-37) receptor might contribute to the impaired insulin secretion in this disorder. \nThe interaction of vasodilating drugs and sympathetic blockade in normal and ischemic canine hindlimbs. The purpose of this study was to determine if intraarterial vasodilating drugs could augment the vasodilation produced by sympathetic blockade, such as occurs during epidural anesthesia. Papaverine (2 mg/min), nitroglycerin (1 microgram/kg/min), aand saline were infused into the femoral artery before and after lumbar sympathectomy in six arterially isolated canine hindlimbs. Femoral blood flow was controlled with a perfusion circuit at baseline (80 ml/min), half-baseline (40 ml/min), and low (5 ml/min) flow rates so that hindlimb mean arterial pressure served as an index of peripheral vasodilation. At low flow, hindlimb arteriovenous oxygen content difference increased from 1.4 (baseline) to 6.2 ml O2/dl, consistent with peripheral ischemia. At baseline flow before sympathectomy, papaverine and nitroglycerin caused a decrease in hindlimb mean arterial pressure of 30% and 18%, respectively (p less than 0.01 vs saline control), equivalent to the decreases of 31% and 16% after sympathectomy (p less than 0.01). At half-baseline, papaverine and nitroglycerin reduced hindlimb mean arterial pressure by 22% and 12%, respectively (p less than 0.01), and caused comparable vasodilation after sympathectomy. Neither drug significantly changed hindlimb mean arterial pressure at low flow. Sympathectomy itself reduced hindlimb mean arterial pressure by 23% at baseline flow (p less than 0.01), by 18% at half-baseline flow (p less than 0.01), but had no effect at low flow. We conclude that intraarterial papaverine and nitroglycerin cause peripheral vasodilation that is synergistic with sympathectomy-induced adrenergic blockade, but they cannot augment vasodilation caused by peripheral ischemia. \nPositive and negative exercise test results with and without exercise-induced angina in patients with one healed myocardial infarction: analysis of baseline variables and long-term prognosis. The prognostic implications of exercise test results with and without exercised-induced angina are not completely understood. In the Program On the Surgical Control Of the Hyperlipidemias (POSCH), 838 subjects with hyperlipidemia who had one healed myocardial infarction were studied and followed for 6 to 13 years (mean 8.6). Of the 417 control subjects, 279 had a treadmill exercise test result that was definitely positive or negative. Angina was also induced by exercise in 30% (45/150) and 8% (10/129) of those with a positive and a negative test result, respectively (p less than 0.0001). The data showed no difference between subjects with a positive or a negative test result with or without angina as regards levels of blood lipids, type of myocardial infarction (Q or non-Q wave), left ventricular function, or prognosis as defined by death, atherosclerotic coronary heart disease death, or myocardial infarction. \nProstatic occurrence of transitional cell carcinoma after intravesical chemotherapy. Thirteen patients with Stage Tis, Ta, or T1 transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder treated by transurethral resections and intravesical chemotherapy developed TCC of the prostate. Among the 13 cases, cytology specimens were obtained from 10 at the time prostatic disease was diagnosed; 9 demonstrated TCC. One was treated successfully by transurethral resection of a Ta lesion involving the prostatic urethra only. One of 2 patients declining radical surgery is alive with residual disease at twenty-four months, and the other died of progressive disease at nineteen months. Of the 10 patients who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy, 7 are alive with no evidence of disease eight to forty-two months postoperatively, with 2 of these 7 having received 4 courses of systemic methotrexate, vincristine, Adriamycin, and cisplatinum (MVAC) for metastatic disease. Two of the 10 died of metastatic disease six and thirteen months postoperatively, and one frail patient died of surgical complications. When treating patients with intravesical chemotherapy for superficial TCC, biopsy of the prostate should be done during follow-up examinations, especially in the presence of cytologic or palpable prostatic abnormalities. \nGene transfer into vascular cells. The goal of gene therapy is to introduce foreign deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into somatic cells to correct or prevent disorders caused by the malfunction of genes within a diseased individual. Overexpression of recombinant genes at specific sites within the vasculature can provide insights into vascular biology and potential treatments for various cardiovascular disorders such as restenosis. Methods for the introduction of foreign DNA into endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells have been developed recently. These include the genetic modification of endothelium in vitro and implantation in vivo on arterial segments, direct infection of the arterial wall in vivo with a replication-defective retroviral vector expressing a recombinant gene and direct transfer of genes into vascular cells in vivo with use of liposomes. Although still in its formative stages, gene transfer into the vasculature holds promise as a potential treatment for vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and restenosis. This approach may also provide insight into the role of specific gene products in the development of pathologic lesions. \nProspective blinded trial of the colonoscopic miss-rate of large colorectal polyps. We prospectively studied the colonoscopic miss-rate of large colorectal polyps in a blinded trial featuring tandem colonoscopy. Sixty-three lesions greater than or equal to 1 cm in size were discovered and none were missed. Confidence intervals of 95% are a miss-rate of 0 to 4.6%. We conclude that less than 5% of large colorectal polyps are missed during the index colonoscopic examination in a well-prepared colon. \nAcalculous biliary pain: cholecystectomy alleviates symptoms in patients with abnormal cholescintigraphy. A 45-minute infusion of an octapeptide of cholecystokinin (Kinevac; Squibb Diagnostics, New Brunswick, NJ) was used to measure the gallbladder ejection fraction during cholescintigraphy in 40 normal volunteers. Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy was shown to be a reproducible test. The maximum mean gallbladder ejection fraction occurred 15 minutes after cholecystokinin infusion and was 74.5% +/- 1.9% (mean +/- SEM). A gallbladder ejection fraction greater than 40% (mean -3SD) was arbitrarily defined to be normal. The gallbladder ejection fraction test was then used to identify patients with acalculous biliary symptoms who may respond to cholecystectomy. A total of 103 patients was tested; 21 had abnormal gallbladder ejection fractions and were randomized into two groups, cholecystectomy or no operation. These patients were followed up symptomatically at 3-month intervals for 13-54 months (mean, 34 months). Of the 11 patients who underwent cholecystectomy, 10 (91%) lost their symptoms and 1 improved. Of the 10 patients in the group that did not undergo surgery, all continued to be symptomatic, 2 of whom requested cholecystectomy after 13 and 24 months, respectively. Of the 13 gallbladders obtained from surgery, 12 showed evidence of chronic cholecystitis, muscle hypertrophy, and/or narrowed cystic duct. A normal gallbladder ejection fraction was recorded in 82 patients, and further treatment was left to the discretion of their referring clinician. On follow-up, 50 patients were asymptomatic and 10 were symptomatic without specific treatment of the biliary tract; 14 underwent cholecystectomy, 8 of whom were asymptomatic. Pathological abnormalities were recorded in 6 of the removed gallbladders. It is concluded that the gallbladder ejection fraction obtained after a 45-minute infusion of cholecystokinin during cholescintigraphy is a reproducible measure of gallbladder emptying, and that cholecystectomy alleviates the biliary-type pain of patients with a reduced gallbladder ejection fraction. \nElectroencephalogram patterns during sleep reflux in infants. Twenty-four infants, 3-35 months of age, with histories of apnea or chronic lung disease underwent nighttime polysomnography and esophageal pH monitoring. Fifteen infants had pathological levels of gastroesophageal reflux on esophageal pH monitoring, and 9 had normal study results (symptomatic controls). Partition of sleep stages, sleep efficiency, and frequency of arousals to electroencephalographic stage 0 were the same in both groups. During sleeping reflux episodes, defined as reflux starting during sleep stages 1-5 or reflux episodes consisting of greater than 50% of sleep stages 1-5, there was a 50% decrease in the amount of stage 0 electroencephalogram pattern compared with nonreflux sleep, and a compensatory increase in the non-rapid eye movement sleep stages. Reflux onsets in patients with pathological reflux were evenly divided between stages 0, 1/2, and 5. Onset of reflux occurred rarely during sleep stages 3 and 4. Slight body movement accompanied the onset of 62.5% of sleep reflux episodes in symptomatic controls and 64.7% in patients with pathological gastroesophageal reflux. Arousals to stage 0 electroencephalogram occurred with equal frequency in sleep reflux episodes of symptomatic controls and patients, and frequency did not increase over the observed value for nonreflux time. There were no differences between the sleep patterns of infants with and without pathological gastroesophageal reflux; nor were there decreases in arousals from sleep in infants with pathological reflux. However, reflux occurring during sleep in all infants studied was characterized by a significant decrease in stage 0 (waking) electroencephalogram. \nIntraoperative cardiovascular collapse secondary to latex allergy. An apparent allergic reaction has been noted in children undergoing open urological surgery. This condition is characterized by precipitous hypotension, tachycardia and upper body flushing, and it often causes termination of the procedure. Latex allergy has been identified as the possible inciting event. Contact of latex rubber gloves with intra-abdominal structures (handling bowel) appears to be the most dramatic trigger mechanism for this reaction. We report on 10 patients with latex allergy, 6 of whom have myelomeningocele, who have undergone reconstructive surgery. Severe anaphylactic shock developed intraoperatively in 5 patients and during a barium enema performed with a latex catheter in 1 patient. These 6 patients had previous allergic reactions to latex material, which was not detected preoperatively. In the remaining 4 patients latex allergy was diagnosed preoperatively. A total of 6 patients agreed to a skin prick test to liquid latex. Three patients reacted with a wheal size greater than or equal to a histamine control at a dilution of 1:1,000 and 3 patients at 1:100. In contrast, none of the 5 normal controls reacted to any of the concentrations including full strength latex. A history of exposure to latex products (balloons, surgical gloves, catheters, condoms and so forth) with allergic reactions should heighten surgeon awareness of a potentially severe intraoperative reaction. Furthermore, a skin prick test may be used to screen high risk patients such as those with myelomeningocele. A protocol involving preoperative corticosteroid and antihistamine therapy is recommended. \nNecrosis of the small intestine after resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Small bowel infarction following abdominal aortic reconstruction is extremely rare, and the prognosis remains poor. This report describes a 65-year-old man with small bowel infarction after resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was successfully treated with resection of the ischemic segment from the distal duodenum to the mid-small bowel and construction of a duodenoileostomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. \nLocalization of HeLa cell tumor-suppressor gene to the long arm of chromosome II. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses of human intraspecific HeLa x fibroblast hybrids have provided evidence for the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene(s) on chromosome 11 of normal cells. In the present study, we have carried out extensive RFLP analysis of various nontumorigenic and tumorigenic hybrids with at least 50 different chromosome 11-specific probes to determine the precise location of this tumor-suppressor gene(s). Two different hybrid systems, (1) microcell hybrids derived by the transfer of a normal chromosome 11 into a tumorigenic HeLa-derived hybrid cell and (2) somatic cell hybrids derived by the fusion of the HeLa (D98OR) cells to a retinoblastoma (Y79) cell line, were particularly informative. The analysis showed that all but one of the nontumorigenic hybrid cell lines contained a complete copy of the normal chromosome 11. This variant hybrid contained a segment of the long arm but had lost the entire short arm of the chromosome. The tumorigenic microcell and somatic cell hybrids had retained the short arm of the chromosome but had lost at least the q13-23 region of the chromosome. Thus, these results showed a perfect correlation between the presence of the long arm of chromosome 11 and the suppression of the tumorigenic phenotype. We conclude therefore that the gene(s) involved in the suppression of the HeLa cell tumors is localized to the long arm (q arm) of chromosome 11. \nTeratogenic effect of carbamazepine. A girl was born to a mother who had undergone treatment for epilepsy with carbamazepine during pregnancy. The infant had dysmorphic features and was physically and mentally retarded. We consider that the malformations were the result of the maternal treatment with carbamazepine. \nThe value of estrogen and progesterone receptor determinations in advanced breast cancer. Estrogen receptor level but not progesterone receptor level correlates with response to tamoxifen. Four hundred fifteen patients with metastatic breast cancer with known hormone receptor status received primary treatment with tamoxifen. Measured values for the estrogen receptor (ER, i.e., with estrogen binding) followed a continuous distribution (range, 3 to 1000 fmol/mg of protein). These values correlated positively with age. The response to treatment with tamoxifen correlated with the ER level, with response rates of approximately 80% when the ER level was greater than 30.1 fmol/mg of protein. Two hundred eighteen (218 of 415, 52%) patients had progesterone receptor (PR) values greater than 10 fmol/mg. The PR positivity correlated with the ER level. Patients with PR levels greater than 10 fmol/mg of protein (124 of 226, 55%) had a significantly higher response rate than those with values less than 10 fmol/mg of protein (45 of 189, 24%). However, in a multivariate analysis including both receptor levels, age, site, and number of metastases, only the ER level was significant in predicting the response to treatment with tamoxifen. A quantitative estimation of the ER level thus is the best predictor of response to hormonal treatment with tamoxifen for advanced breast cancer. \nHypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses in parents and siblings of children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. Children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) have abnormal ventilatory responses to metabolic stimuli. As there is a genetically determined component of chemoreceptor sensitivity, parents and siblings of children with CCHS may also have blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnea and hypoxia. To test this, we studied hypercapnic ventilatory responses and hypoxic ventilatory responses in six mothers, four fathers, and five siblings (6 to 49 yr of age) of seven children with CCHS and compared them with 15 age- and sex-matched control subjects (5 to 47 yr of age). Pulmonary function tests were not different between relatives of children with CCHS and control subjects. To measure hypercapnic ventilatory responses, subjects rebreathed 5% CO2/95% O2 until PACO2 reached 60 to 70 mm Hg. To measure hypoxic ventilatory responses (L/min/% SaO2), subjects rebreathed 14% O2/7% CO2/balance N2 at mixed venous PCO2 until SaO2 fell to 75%. All tests were completed in less than 4 min. Instantaneous minute ventilation, mean inspiratory flow (tidal volume/inspiratory time), and respiratory timing (inspiratory timing/total respiratory cycle timing) were calculated on a breath-by-breath basis. Hypercapnic ventilatory responses were 1.97 +/- 0.32 L/min/mm Hg PACO2 in children with CCHS relatives and 2.23 +/- 0.23 L/min/mm Hg PACO2 in control subjects. Hypoxic ventilatory responses were -1.99 +/- 0.37 L/min/% SaO2 in the relatives and -1.54 +/- 0.25 L/min/% SaO2 in the control subjects. \nMediators, initiating the inflammatory response, released in organ culture by full-thickness human skin explants exposed to the irritant, sulfur mustard. Mediators released from injured human skin that initiate the inflammatory response have not been adequately identified. Organ culture of full-thickness skin explants enables us to do so, because injury to the skin can be made in vitro, eliminating the rapid leakage of serum and infiltration of leukocytes that occur in vivo. In our studies, the military vesicant sulfur mustard (SM) (10 microliters of a 0.01 to 1.0% dilution) was topically applied to injure the epidermis of the explant. Then, the explants were cultured in small Petri dishes, usually for 18 h at 36 degrees C, and the organ-culture fluids were assayed for various inflammatory mediators. We found that the culture fluids from SM-exposed and control explants contained similar amounts of angiotensin-converting enzyme, trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like proteases, acid phosphatase, beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, lysozyme, deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, interleukin 1, and lactic dehydrogenase. However, the culture fluids from SM-exposed explants contained increased amounts of histamine and plasminogen-activating activity, and often prostaglandin E2, when compared to culture fluids from control explants. After 3 to 4 d in culture, full-thickness human skin explants, when exposed to 0.2% SM (but not when exposed to 1.0% SM), sometimes showed separation of the epidermis and increased collagenase activity (i.e., hydroxyproline release). Thus, histamine (from local mast cells), and prostaglandin E2 and plasminogen-activating activity (probably from both mast cells and epidermal cells) are apparently involved in early mediation of the inflammatory response. \nComparison of ondansetron and ondansetron plus dexamethasone as antiemetic prophylaxis during cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Ondansetron, a serotonin antagonist, is effective in controlling the emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy; however, emesis in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin is poorly controlled by ondansetron alone. Dexamethasone is an effective antiemetic with no known interaction with serotonin receptors and was thus chosen for study in combination with ondansetron. 31 patients (30 male, 1 female; median age 28.5 years, range 18-49) receiving a 4-day course of a chemotherapy regimen containing cisplatin (100-120 mg/m2) for metastatic germ-cell tumours were entered in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial comparing oral ondansetron plus placebo with oral ondansetron plus dexamethasone as antiemetic prophylaxis. Ondansetron (8 mg every 8 h) was given to all patients for 8 days from the start of chemotherapy. Patients were given 8 mg of dexamethasone or placebo every 8 h starting 2 h before cisplatin (on day 4) and continuing for six doses (ie, for 2 days only). A second course of chemotherapy began 14 days after the start of the first, during which patients crossed over to the alternative antiemetic regimen. Results were available from 27 patients. In the 24-48 h after cisplatin 78% of patients taking ondansetron plus dexamethasone reported complete or major control of emesis compared with 30% of those taking ondansetron plus placebo (p = 0.001). Cross-over analysis showed a significant advantage for ondansetron plus dexamethasone in the control of nausea (p = 0.013) and emesis (p less than 0.001) over the 8-day study. 24 of 26 patients expressed a preference for the combination therapy (p less than 0.001). Ondansetron plus dexamethasone is effective antiemetic prophylaxis for high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy, has few side effects, and is active when given orally. \nTorsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia and terodiline. We report five patients (four women, one man; mean age 74 years, range 55-87) taking terodiline who had torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia associated with prolongation of the QT interval. The QT interval was normal before the introduction of terodiline in three patients and returned to normal after terodiline withdrawal in four. Atrioventricular conduction disturbance or bradycardia were evident in all patients. Terodiline should be prescribed with caution to elderly patients. \nPsychosis following temporal lobe surgery: a report of six cases. Six consecutive patients who had had temporal lobe surgery for epilepsy, and been referred for psychiatric assessment of psychotic symptoms, are reported. Their symptoms (a delusional depression, four schizophrenia-like illnesses, and a case of Capgras' syndrome) are discussed in relation to the possible role of their operations, all of which were on the right hemisphere. \nThe hemodynamic response to hemorrhage in tumor-bearing animals. Tumor-bearing rats submitted to hypovolemia have higher mortality rates than have non-tumor-bearing control rats. To determine the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity to hemorrhage, we studied Fischer-344 rats with subcutaneous methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma (tumor burden, 10% body weight) to determine hematologic and blood volume alterations. Subsequently we used the same animal model in an unanesthetized condition to determine the sensitivity to hemorrhage and resuscitation, as well as vascular responsiveness to vasoactive agents. The rats were separated into two groups: control and tumor-bearing rats (TBR). Sensitivity to hemorrhage and resuscitation was determined by bleeding the conscious rats (15 ml/kg) and resuscitating them with 0.9% NaCl (45 ml/kg). Vascular responsiveness was determined after injection of varying doses of phenylephrine and nitroglycerin, with continuous measurement of mean arterial pressure (MAP). Rate of increase of MAP, maximum MAP, relative increase in MAP (maximum minus baseline), rate of recovery toward baseline MAP, and duration of the response were determined. There was a significant anemia in TBR, but blood volume was similar in both groups. Baseline MAP was significantly higher in control rats (125.3 +/- 8.1 mm Hg) compared with TBR (107.5 +/- 6.0 mm Hg). After hemorrhage, MAP in TBR reached significantly lower levels than in control rats. In addition, after saline resuscitation, MAP in TBR did not return to baseline levels, whereas MAP in control rats returned to prehemorrhage MAP. With nitroglycerin, MAP decreased to lower levels in TBR than in control rats. With phenylephrine, the maximum MAP reached was significantly higher, and the response to phenylephrine was maintained for a significantly longer period in control rats compared with TBR. We conclude that TBR are more sensitive to hypovolemic events in association with decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, profound hypotension, and altered overall vascular responsiveness to sympathetic stimuli. \nGangrene of the fingers secondary to myeloproliferative disease. The myeloproliferative disorders comprise a group of related diseases, including polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelofibrosis, and myeloid metaplasia. An increase in circulating platelets is associated with thrombotic phenomena affecting the arterial and venous circulation. In this article, the authors describe a case in which the initial manifestation of myeloproliferative disease was gangrene of the fingers. \nEffects of enflurane on inducibility of ventricular tachycardia. The effects of enflurane on cardiac electrophysiologic parameters and on inducibility of ventricular tachycardia (VT) by programmed stimulation were studied in 12 patients (11 men, 1 woman, mean age +/- standard deviation 55 +/- 8 years) with drug refractory sustained monomorphic VT who underwent transcatheter ablation with high-energy direct-current shocks. One catheter ablation procedure was performed in 10 patients, whereas 2 ablation sessions were necessary in 2 patients. Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed on 2 separate days (mean interval 19). There were 2 baseline studies, 1 several days before (\"baseline study I\") and the second at the beginning of the ablation procedure (\"baseline study II\") while the patient was awake and nonsedated. The third programmed stimulation study was done 15 to 30 minutes after administration of anesthesia with enflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide (\"enflurane study\"). Rate of sinus rhythm, QRS duration, PQ interval and ventricular effective refractory period were unaltered, whereas QTc interval increased significantly after initiation of anesthesia. Before and after induction of general anesthesia, clinical VT was inducible in all patients. However, in 1 patient, induction of VT was only possible by pacing in the left ventricle after enflurane administration. Based on these data, it is concluded that general anesthesia with enflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide has no marked influence on inducibility of clinical VTs. Therefore, this type of anesthesia may be useful for nonpharmacologic, ablative procedures requiring general anesthesia. \nA randomized comparison of multipolar electrocoagulation and injection sclerosis for the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcer. Several options are available to the gastroenterologist for the endoscopic control of peptic ulcer hemorrhage. Sixty men (mean age, 62 years) were stratified into those with actively bleeding ulcers or ulcers with stigmata of recent hemorrhage, and then randomized to treatment with injection sclerosis or the multipolar probe until bleeding ceased. There were no significant differences between the randomized groups in terms of age, ulcer size, or transfusion requirements. We achieved hemostasis in 95% of all patients. Re-bleeding rates were 25% and 23% in patients treated with the multipolar probe and injection sclerosis, respectively. There was no significant difference in mortality (14% multipolar probe, 7% injection sclerosis). Patients over the age of 70, those whose onset of bleeding was while an inpatient, and those with an ulcer larger than 2 cm were more likely to have a poor outcome, regardless of the type of endoscopic therapy. Injection sclerosis and multipolar electrocoagulation are equally effective in controlling bleeding from peptic ulcer. \nResponse of osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma to chemotherapy: imaging evaluation. The importance of diagnostic imaging in evaluating therapeutic response of bone sarcomas has increased with the use of chemotherapy administered before radiation therapy or surgery. The information provided by imaging studies is used to estimate prognosis; modify preoperative chemotherapy; and plan radiation therapy, surgery, and postoperative chemotherapy. This review examines the value and illustrates some pitfalls of traditional imaging methods, including conventional radiography, angiography, CT, and radionuclide scintigraphy, and discusses recent efforts to monitor therapy by using MR imaging and MR spectroscopy. \nSucralfate retention enemas in solitary rectal ulcer. The conservative treatment of solitary rectal ulcer is generally unsatisfactory. Six patients, aged 27-54 years, with recurrent solitary rectal ulcer were treated with topical administration of sucralfate in a daily dose of 2 g twice a day for 6 weeks. Four patients experienced complete relief of symptoms and the remaining two patients had marked improvement. Although macroscopic healing of the ulcer was apparent in all, histologic improvement was not appreciable. Five of the six patients remain in remission during a follow-up period of 4-14 months (mean, 8 +/- 1.5 months). Recurrence was observed in one patient at 5 months, which satisfactorily resolved with sucralfate enemas. From these preliminary observations we infer that solitary rectal ulcer can be effectively treated with topical application of sucralfate. \nClinical anatomic study of pure dysarthria. Nine patients with pure dysarthria underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Eight patients had infarcts of lacunar or larger size in the internal capsule: four in the superior portion of the anterior limb or adjacent corona radiata and four in the superior portion of the genu or the adjacent corona radiata. In one patient, there was a small infarct in the bulbar motor cortex. Dysarthria was transient and characterized by poor articulation in all cases. Five patients also had contralateral facial weakness, and three patients with lesions in the genu had minimal and transient involvement of the contralateral fingers. These three cases appeared to be variants of the dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome. We submit that this syndrome should sometimes be regarded as a stroke syndrome rather than always as a lacunar syndrome. \nEffect of isradipine and atenolol on lung function in patients with mild essential hypertension. Twenty-six hypertensive patients took part in an open, randomized, parallel-group pilot study of the effects of a nine-week treatment period with the calcium antagonist isradipine and the beta 1-blocking agent atenolol. The mean dosage in the isradipine group was 7.9 +/- 3.5 mg/day, and 69.2 +/- 43.5 mg/day in the atenolol group. A significant reduction of the arterial blood pressure was seen with both treatment regimens. Lung volumes and airways resistance remained unchanged, but, in the atenolol-treated group, the linear relationship between alveolar pressure and airways resistance at the lower lung volumes during forced expiration at 25% of forced vital capacity was affected by a shift to higher airways resistance. This change can be interpreted as an early sign of altered air-flow behavior in the small airways in subjects susceptible to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The calcium antagonist isradipine did not produce changes in any parameters of lung function in this group of patients. \nA technique for needle localization in paraspinal muscles with cadaveric confirmation. Invasive electromyography (EMG) of the paraspinal muscles is useful in clinical and research settings. No technique for localization of the needle in specific fascicles has been validated. Recent descriptions of the segmented innervation of the multifidus imply that such a technique would add greatly to the EMG determination of root level of a radiculopathy. We have developed a technique for localization which relies on palpation of bony structures and needle insertion at certain angles and depths. The technique was evaluated by injecting latex dye in 199 locations in 13 cadavers. Dissection demonstrated that the technique was accurate in 91 of 112 injections into specific fascicles of the multifidus (originating from different spinous processes), 39 of 43 injections into the longissimus, and 35 of 44 injections into the iliocostalis. Certain types of errors would not have occurred with the aid of EMG in vivo. When these are added to the correct injections, accuracy improves 97%, 93%, and 82%, respectively. The technique described here should be useful for kinesiological studies, biopsies and injections, as well as for the EMG confirmation of a radiculopathy. \nUse of oligonucleotide probes directed against T cell antigen receptor gamma delta variable-(diversity)-joining junctional sequences as a general method for detecting minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. To provide a sensitive and generally applicable method to detect clonal cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), we have designed a new strategy based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the T cell receptor gamma delta gene rearrangements found in most T and B lineage ALLs. PCR allows rapid sequencing of variable-(diversity)-joining (V-[D]-J) junctions from tumor DNA and construction of anti-junctional oligonucleotides (AJOs) used as probes to detect clonal cells in the same patient. We have defined oligonucleotides suitable for all T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements involving functional V gamma segments. Oligonucleotides corresponding to preferential TCR delta rearrangements in T and B lineage ALLs were also used. By analysis of the nucleotide sequence of 52 V gamma-V gamma junctions from 30 cases of B and T ALLs, we demonstrate that V-J junctional sequences are clone specific in both lineages and at all stages of differentiation examined despite the frequent presence of the recently described P nucleotides. Experiments performed with TCR gamma delta AJOs on DNA from tumor cells and polyclonal T cells show that AJOs can be used to differentiate clonal cells from polyclonal T cells, distinguish between different T cell clones, and detect residual clonal populations at 10(-4)/10(-5) dilution. AJOs were also used to detect residual disease in samples from patients in clinical and morphological complete remission. Finally, rearrangement patterns were studied by classical Southern analysis in selected cases at both presentation and subsequent relapse showing absence of clonal evolution in most cases. V-(D)-J nucleotide sequences of rearrangements with an identical pattern of rearrangement at presentation and relapse were identical in all cases analyzed. We therefore describe a new, specific, and clinically useful strategy for the detection of minor clonal populations applicable in the majority of cases of ALL. \nHypertension in young patients. Hypertension is often unrecognized in infants and children. Primary care physicians need the equipment necessary to measure blood pressure in young patients and tables or graphs showing normal values for age and sex. Children should have a blood pressure measurement and preventive counseling at each yearly checkup. Significant hypertension should never be dismissed as a temporary problem but rather should be carefully investigated, treated, and followed up. \nTuberculous pericarditis. Tuberculosis is responsible for approximately 4% of cases of acute pericarditis, 7% of cases of cardiac tamponade, and, in older studies, 6% of instances of constrictive pericarditis. However, in some nonindustrialized countries, tuberculosis is a leading cause of pericarditis. The diagnosis is based on demonstration of tubercle bacilli in pericardial fluid or on histologic section of the pericardium, or proof of tuberculosis elsewhere in a patient with otherwise unexplained pericarditis. Treatment consists of triple drug therapy for at least 9 months (isoniazid, rifampin, and streptomycin or ethambutol). Pyrazinamide can be used for the first 2 months, and the total therapeutic period can then be shortened to 6 months after culture conversion. Three months of corticosteroid therapy may be useful in patients in whom pericardial effusion persists or recurs despite the use of antituberculous drugs. Surgical resection of the pericardium is indicated for recurrent or life-threatening tamponade, or when there is persistent elevation of systemic venous pressure unrelieved by pericardiocentesis. As many as one third to one half of patients will eventually require pericardiectomy despite adequate drug therapy. \nSequential high-dose methotrexate and fluorouracil combined with doxorubicin--a step ahead in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer: a trial of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gastrointestinal Tract Cooperative Group. In a prospective phase III multicenter trial, 213 patients with advanced measurable or nonmeasurable gastric cancer were randomized to receive methotrexate (MTX), fluorouracil (5-FU), and Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) (FAMTX) or 5-FU, Adriamycin, and mitomycin (FAM). The results show a significantly superior response rate (41% v 9% [P less than .0001]), and survival (median, 42 weeks v 29 weeks [P = .004]) for FAMTX. There was a cumulative thrombocytopenia in FAM and not in FAMTX. The FAMTX protocol should be the reference treatment in future clinical trials that seek to improve the therapeutic outcome in advanced gastric cancer. \nGenitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma in children. The survival rates for childhood rhabdomyosarcomas have risen from 20% to 50% with the institution of a multidisciplinary approach involving the pediatric oncologist, radiation therapist, and surgeon. Increased survival has been particularly striking in the case of genitourinary rhabdomyosarcomas, which have a more favorable prognosis than rhabdomyosarcomas occurring in other anatomic sites. By stratifying genitourinary rhabdomyosarcomas by anatomic subgroup, i.e., paratesticular, bladder or bladder-prostate, and gynecologic, insight into specific predictors of failure can be obtained. Patients judged to be high risk at diagnosis can then be selected for more intensive or novel forms of therapy. \nIncrement-threshold spectral sensitivity in blindsight. Evidence for colour opponency. In the circumscribed visual field defects of 3 patients, increment-threshold spectral sensitivity was measured with a guessing paradigm. Nine 116', 200 ms narrowband stimuli with maximum transmission between 450 and 660 nm were presented on a white background of photopic or scotopic luminance. Sensitivity measured in the blind field was compared with that at matched positions in the patients' normal hemifield, and with that at corresponding positions in 2 control subjects. Results show that spectral sensitivity in the blind field, albeit reduced by up to 1 log unit, shows normal dependence on adaptation level, reflecting rod activity under scotopic, and cone activity under photopic conditions. Characteristic discontinuities in the spectral sensitivity curve seen under light adaptation are evidence for colour-opponent processes, presumably involving primate beta retinal ganglion cells. \nEffect of lung hyperinflation and endotracheal suctioning on heart rate and rhythm in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We examined the effect of lung hyperinflation and suction on PaO2, heart rate, and rhythm in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (N = 26). Three lung hyperinflation breaths, at one of five randomly ordered volumes (tidal volume, 12 cc/kg, 14 cc/kg, 16 cc/kg, or 18 cc/kg of lean body weight) were delivered, by a ventilator (fraction of inspired oxygen 1.0), followed by 10 seconds of continuous suction. Lung hyperinflation and suctioning were repeated three times. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant increase (p = 0.000) in PaO2 immediately after the third suction pass, which was volume dependent (p = 0.009). A statistically significant (p less than 0.001) increase in heart rate from baseline occurred over the three lung hyperinflation-suctioning sequences that was not volume dependent. The mean increase in heart rate was 6.8 beats/min. The majority of rhythm changes for lung hyperinflation and suctioning were from normal sinus rhythm to sinus tachycardia. Suction was associated with a greater incidence of rhythm (53.9%) and arrhythmia (80.8%) changes. The most frequent arrhythmia was premature atrial contraction. \nPathogenesis of nephrolithiasis post-partial ileal bypass surgery: case-control study. The POSCH Group. Between 1975 and 1983, 838 patients were randomized into the Program on the Surgical Control of Hyperlipidemias (POSCH) trial: 417 to standard medical care and 421 to partial ileal bypass (PIB) surgery. During the course of the trial, an increased incidence of kidney stone formation was found in the surgery group (4%/year) as compared to the control group (0.4%/year). A matched triplet case-control study was conducted to assess the possible causes for the increased incidence of kidney stones. Three groups were studied: PIB stone-formers (S); PIB non-stone formers (N); and non-PIB, non-stone formers in the control group (C). Initially, 162 patients (54 triplets) were selected. Ten percent of the patients declined to participate which resulted in a sample size of 146 patients. The PIB patients had statistically significant (P less than 0.05) lower levels of serum vitamin D metabolites; lower urine volume, pH, citrate, magnesium, carbon dioxide, and sulfate, and higher urinary oxalate, ammonia and relative supersaturation for calcium oxalate and uric acid than the control patients. Although S and N had similar results, those S with no prior history of stones had a higher calcium oxalate supersaturation than similar N with a negative prior history of stones (P less than 0.025). Based on these results, all PIB patients appear to be at risk for kidney stone formation. The combination of reduced urinary volume and calcium oxalate precipitation inhibitor substance with increased calcium oxalate relative supersaturation produced an increase in nephrolithiasis risk in the PIB groups. \nCatabolic illness. Strategies for enhancing recovery. After injury, infection, extensive chemotherapy, and other critical illnesses, both protein and fat are lost from the body. Although minor alterations in body composition are probably of little clinical importance, losses of body protein of 10 percent or more contribute to morbidity and debility. This catabolic response can be modified and recovery can be accelerated by a variety of approaches. First, the inflammatory response can be reduced; second, specific nutrients can be provided to support the patient's tissue requirements during catabolic illness; and third, growth factors can be used to enhance protein synthesis and tissue repair. These approaches, whether used alone or in combination, will reduce the loss of body protein, which should accelerate recovery, shorten the length of hospitalization, and reduce convalescence. \nNonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and intraocular pressure. Several reports have suggested that nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) may be related to increased intraocular pressure. We reviewed the records of 45 patients aged 48 through 86 years with nonarteritic AION (10 patients had bilateral AION) for intraocular pressure measurements and the diagnosis of glaucoma or suspected glaucoma. This group was compared with 45 age- and sex-matched patients with normal eye examination results. The mean +/- SD intraocular pressures were 16.3 +/- 3.3 mm Hg for 45 eyes of the 45 patients with AION and 16.1 +/- 2.8 mm Hg for 45 eyes of the 45 control patients (paired t test, P = .70). Among patients with unilateral AION, intraocular pressure was not greater in the involved eye than in the uninvolved eye. Three patients with AION had a previous diagnosis of glaucoma, while three of the control patients were being followed up with suspected glaucoma. We found no evidence in our series to support the hypothesis that AION is associated with increased intraocular pressure. \nApplication and results of the AO internal fixation system in nontraumatic indications. The AO internal skeletal fixation system (ISFS) permits posterior spine fixation to be restricted to the vertebrae immediately adjacent to the lesion and allows manipulation of each instrumented vertebra in three planes. In a prospective study to assess the value of this fixation for adult spinal disorders, 68 patients were reviewed. The device was used in spondylolisthesis, postlaminectomy instability, post-traumatic kyphosis, degenerative scoliosis, spinal stenosis, tumors, and infections. A total of 322 transpedicular screws have been inserted without neurologic complication. Satisfactory results were achieved in 88% of the patients, and only four pseudarthroses (6%) occurred. The ISFS provides rigid stabilization to enhance bone graft consolidation and to allow rapid postoperative mobilization in a light external orthosis. \nAnomalous papillary muscle producing dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. A patient with a dynamic left ventricular outflow murmur was shown to have an anomalous anterolateral papillary muscle by transthoracic and transesophageal two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography. High late systolic outflow velocity and systolic anterior motion were demonstrated in the lateral outflow tract near the anomalous muscle, suggesting a role for the Venturi effect. This is the first confirmation by Doppler echocardiography of an anomalous papillary muscle contributing to abnormal left ventricular hemodynamics. \nComplex partial status epilepticus of extratemporal origin: report of a case. A 28-year-old woman with no history of seizure was 7 months pregnant when she developed a prolonged complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE) organized in recurrent complex partial seizures of occipital origin, which was ascertained by the presence of elementary visual hallucinations and nystagmus heralding the attacks. EEG demonstrated recurrent seizures starting from the right occipital area. This especially refractory case of CPSE resolved after treatment with antiepileptic drugs and termination of pregnancy by cesarean section. \nCranial nerve involvement and base of the skull erosion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In a prospective study of 262 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), using computed tomography (CT) as their baseline evaluation, erosion of the base of the skull and intracranial extension into the middle cranial fossa were found in 31.3% and 12.2% of patients, respectively. Thirty-four of these patients had cranial nerve involvement at presentation; 30 of them had involvement of one or more of the third to sixth cranial nerves. Most cases of intracranial extension of tumor were accompanied by erosion of the base of the skull, but the reverse was not true. All patients with cranial nerve palsy involving the third to sixth cranial nerves had associated erosion of the ipsilateral base of the skull. The CT evaluation of patients with cranial nerve involvement who are believed to harbor NPC should include thin cuts of the base of the skull for detection of subtle bone erosion. This may be the only clue to the presence of a small NPC. The prognostic significance of cranial nerve involvement, base of the skull erosion, and intracranial extension of the tumor on the survival of the group of 84 patients who had T4 tumors was evaluated with regression analysis using the Cox model. Only cranial nerve involvement was found to be a significant factor influencing survival. \nComparison of the generation of albumin-associated cytotoxic activity in supernatants from ethanol-containing cultures of human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and of two human hepatoma cell lines. The rates of oxidation of ethanol to acetate by human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and the two human hepatoma cell lines PLC/PRF/5 and Hep G2 were studied. The average rates obtained were, respectively, 621, 447 and 596 nmol/h/mg cellular protein. Cultures of these three cell types, containing known quantities of cellular protein per flask, were incubated with 0 or 2 mg ethanol/ml for 72 h and the culture supernatants subjected to affinity chromatography on blue sepharose CL-6B. Pure albumin fractions obtained in this way were adjusted to the same optical density and tested for cytotoxicity against A9 cells. The data showed that the albumin fractions obtained from ethanol-containing macrophage cultures were considerably more cytotoxic than those obtained from ethanol-containing cultures of PLC/PRF/5 and Hep G2 cells. It appeared that, for a given quantity of ethanol metabolised, considerably more acetaldehyde was released extracellularly by macrophages than by the two hepatoma cell lines and that this acetaldehyde bound to albumin to form cytotoxic acetaldehyde-albumin complexes. The data raise the possibility that macrophages are an important source of extracellular acetaldehyde and circulating acetaldehyde-albumin complexes in vivo. \nThe endocrine effects of long-term treatment with mifepristone (RU 486). Mifepristone (RU 486) is a compound with progesterone as well as cortisol-blocking activities. We investigated the endocrine effects of long-term therapy of 10 patients with meningiomas with 200 mg mifepristone daily for 1 yr. Most patients initially complained of nausea, vomiting, and/or tiredness. In four patients prednisone (7.5 mg/day) had to be given simultaneously in order to overcome these side-effects. In retrospect those patients who presented with the most severe side-effects showed the most rapidly occurring activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis, as measured by an increase of circulating cortisol levels as well as of urinary cortisol excretion. Therapy with RU 486 activated the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in a resetting of this system at a higher level at which the diurnal rhythm and the responsiveness to CRH stimulation were maintained, whereas the sensitivity to dexamethasone had diminished. Secondarily the production of androstenedione and estradiol increased considerably. These endocrine changes were caused by the induction of partial cortisol receptor resistance during therapy with RU 486. The compensatory overproduction of androgens and consequently of estrogens during long-term RU 486 therapy might limit its use as a single treatment in the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancer. \nDetection of hepatitis B virus DNA in paraffin-embedded liver tissues in chronic hepatitis B or non-A, non-B, hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. We developed a polymerase chain reaction assay for the direct detection of hepatitis B virus in paraffin-embedded liver tissue and applied this assay to determine whether hepatitis B virus DNA exists in livers with chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B. Fifty five liver biopsy samples were studied: 11 from patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis (paraffin-embedded) and 44 from patients with chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B (21 paraffin-embedded; 25 fresh frozen). Thirty three (75%) of the non-A, non-B cases were positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies. Approximately 1 to 10 ng of DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue and amplified using oligonucleotide (23-mer) primers specific for the S gene (positions 261 to 692). The beta-globin gene was used as an internal control for sensitivity because this is a single copy gene and allows for relative quantification. In each of the chronic hepatitis B livers, the expected 432-base-pair amplification product for hepatitis B virus DNA and beta-globin gene product were both detected. On the other hand, in the 21 paraffin-embedded chronic hepatitis non-A, non-B livers, no hepatitis B virus DNA was detected, although beta-globin gene was observed in all. Furthermore, in all 25 frozen non-A, non-B livers, beta-globin gene was observed, but no hepatitis B virus band was seen. The limit of detection of hepatitis B virus DNA by this method was estimated to be one genomic copy of hepatitis B virus DNA per cell. \nVaricella zoster virus DNA in throat swabs. Eighty-one throat swabs from 18 patients infected with varicella were tested for varicella zoster virus DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The positive rates were 26.2% (11/42) during the incubation period and 89.7% (35/39) after clinical onset. The results indicate the pharynx is a site for early replication of the virus. \nContent and boundaries of medicine in long-term care: physicians talk about stroke. Twenty physicians were interviewed about roles, treatments, goals, and relationships with older patients, especially stroke patients. Findings from this descriptive, anthropological investigation address the problem of congruence between needs and existing services, and in doing so, recast the ongoing debate about the medicalization of long-term care. This study emphasized the nonmedical features of geriatric medicine in general and stroke care in particular. In many instances, these physicians attempt to bridge gaps between medical and emotional needs and clinical and social services with social and psychotherapeutic as well as biomedical interventions. Because we found physicians' activities with stroke patients to be so broadly construed, treatment and management of stroke may be seen as paradigmatic for the role of physicians in long-term care. \nThe risk of seizure recurrence following a first unprovoked seizure: a quantitative review. Knowledge of the recurrence risk following a first unprovoked seizure and the predictors of that risk are necessary for rational treatment decisions. Published estimates of recurrence risk range from 23% to 71%. In a meta-analysis of 16 reports, three methodologic factors explained much of the reported variation: (1) study inclusion criteria, ie, whether patients were enrolled at the time of their first seizure or if patients with prior seizures were included; (2) retrospective versus prospective ascertainment of patients; (3) the interval between the first seizure and the time at which risk was assessed. The average recurrence risk across the 16 studies was 51%. The risk was 40% and 52% in prospective and retrospective studies that employed first-seizure methods and 67% in non-first seizure studies. At or near 2 years following the first seizure, the recurrence risk was 36% and 47% in prospective and retrospective first-seizure studies. The distribution of prognostic factors was also important. Seizure etiology and the EEG were the strongest predictors of recurrence distinguishing between patient subgroups, with recurrence risks as low as 24% and as high as 65%. Partial seizures were associated with an increased recurrence risk, but not consistently. There is considerable agreement among studies concerning the recurrence risk following a first seizure, and much of the discrepancies among studies can be explained by differences in study methods and distributions of important prognostic factors. \nPathological features of Crohn's disease determining perforation. Even if Crohn's disease (CD) stenoses are related to perforating complications, such as abscess or fistula, it remains unclear why only some stenoses lead to such complications. We have studied the surgical specimens in 94 cases of CD to characterize the anatomical features of stenosis. We found no differences between group A (patients with perforation) and group B (noncomplicated patients) as far as extent of lesion, number of stenoses, and the caliber of the stenotic bowel. In CD of the ileum, the wall thickness of the stenoses was significantly different: 12.0 +/- 3.4 mm in group A and 7.6 +/- 3.1 mm in group B (p less than 0.001). In colonic CD, the length of stenosis was significantly greater in patients with perforation. Duration of symptoms, age at surgery, and sex did not correlate with the increased thickness or with perforating complications. These observations suggest that the fibrotic gastrointestinal tract, poorly distensible, may increase the intraluminal pressure above the stenosis and in this way squeeze bowel content through mucosal fissures of the inflamed bowel. Evaluation and monitoring of wall thickness may help in prompting surgery before the disease is complicated by perforation. \nPrevalence and prognostic significance of silent and symptomatic ischemia after coronary bypass surgery: a report from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized population. The prevalence and prognostic significance of postoperative myocardial ischemia, as detected by exercise testing, were prospectively assessed in 174 patients from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized surgical population who had exercise testing before and 6 months after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Whereas the prevalence of symptomatic ischemia significantly decreased postoperatively (52% vs. 6%, p less than 0.001), the frequency of silent myocardial ischemia did not change (30% vs. 29%). Survival at 12 years after bypass surgery based on the 6-month postoperative exercise test results was significantly better for the 112 patients with no ischemia (80%) than for the 51 patients with silent ischemia (68%) or the 11 patients with symptomatic ischemia (45%). These data show that coronary artery bypass graft surgery diminishes the overall prevalence of symptomatic but not silent ischemia and that both silent and symptomatic ischemia adversely affect the postoperative prognosis of these patients. \nSubrenal capsule assay using nude mice as a predictor of the response of the gastric cancer to chemotherapy. Feasibility of utilizing human gastric cancers as first transplant generation xenografts in nude mice for determining tumor sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents was demonstrated by applying subrenal capsule (SRC) assay. A total of 55 human gastric tumors from patients were tested in this assay. Mitomycin-C (MMC) and hexycarbamyl-5-FU (HCFU, 5-FU derivative) were selected for the treatment of these patients after surgery and also for this assay as first transplant. Evaluable rate of MMC in this assay was 92.7% and that of HCFU was 90.9%. Sensitivity of tumors to MMC was 25% and to HCFU was 32%. Correlation between response to chemotherapy of human tumors in patients and in nude mice was 78.6%. These results indicate that this assay could predict effective drugs for patients with gastric cancer. \nPreclinical markers in studies of Parkinson's disease. The development of reliable preclinical detection procedures for idiopathic Parkinson's disease may be the fundamental advance required for the establishment of the cause, the natural history, and ultimately, the prevention of this neurodegenerative disorder. The usefulness of these preclinical markers in efforts to better understand the etiology and development of this disorder will relate to whether they are direct measures of dopamine production or indirect measures such as metabolic changes or comorbidity, whether they can be used in the first or later decades of life, whether they are invasive, and whether they are expensive and sophisticated or simple and cheap. An overview of the criteria for evaluation of the utility of specific markers, as well as an assessment of the importance of early markers in future research, is presented. \nRapid growth of untreated esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma in 10 patients. We documented the natural history of esophageal carcinoma and its rapid growth by measuring the change in tumor diameter radiographically in 10 patients during an observation period because the diagnosis had been missed. Nine men and one woman (age range, 48-74 years; mean, 60 years) were included in the study. Eight patients had undergone esophagography for gastrointestinal complaints and had lesions missed on the initial interpretation that were apparent on retrospective review after the patient had returned with more severe complaints and undergone repeat studies; two patients had refused treatment. The tumor was squamous-cell carcinoma in all. The treatment-free retrospective observation period ranged from 4 to 19 months (mean, 12.2 months) and was shorter for elevated (mean, 9.2 months) than for depressed lesions (mean, 16.8 months). The longitudinal diameter increased from 10-100 mm initially (mean, 30.5 mm) to 32-150 mm (mean, 74.9 mm). No correlation existed between the increase in size and histologic features. This documentation of the rapid increase in the size of esophageal carcinoma involving at least the submucosa confirms clinical impressions of the aggressive nature of this lesion and offers an explanation of why this disease is seldom detected at an early stage and long-term survival is so poor after the early stage of disease. \nPrimary intrasellar coccidioidomycosis simulating a pituitary adenoma. The case of a 68-year-old woman who had relatively acute, unilateral ophthalmoplegia is reported. Radiological studies indicated a mass lesion involving the pituitary gland and left cavernous sinus. Pathological tissue obtained by the transsphenoidal approach revealed the presence of a Coccidioides granuloma. This pathological entity should be considered when evaluating patients with a pituitary mass and ophthalmoplegia. \nMapping of DNA instability at the fragile X to a trinucleotide repeat sequence p(CCG)n. The sequence of a Pst I restriction fragment was determined that demonstrate instability in fragile X syndrome pedigrees. The region of instability was localized to a trinucleotide repeat p(CCG)n. The sequence flanking this repeat were identical in normal and affected individuals. The breakpoints in two somatic cell hybrids constructed to break at the fragile site also mapped to this repeat sequence. The repeat exhibits instability both when cloned in a nonhomologous host and after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. These results suggest variation in the trinucleotide repeat copy number as the molecular basis for the instability and possibly the fragile site. This would account for the observed properties of this region in vivo and in vitro. \nCorrelation of the blind spot size to the area of the optic disk and parapapillary atrophy. We evaluated the relationship between the optic disk and the blind spot area. Using kinetic Goldmann perimetry in 23 patients with open-angle glaucoma and 19 normal subjects, the blind spot size was correlated significantly with the total area of the optic disk, peripapillary scleral ring, and parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy. Zone beta of the parapapillary atrophy with a visible sclera was attributed to an absolute scotoma, and zone alpha with irregular pigmentation was attributed to a relative scotoma. The blind spot was significantly larger in the glaucomatous eyes than in the normal eyes, which corresponded with a larger zone beta in the glaucomatous eyes. The intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head correlated to the size of the blind spot, which included the parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy and a significant size difference between normal and glaucomatous eyes. \nGastroenteritis associated with consumption of raw shellfish--Hawaii, 1991. On January 2, 1991, 12 of 24 persons who attended one or more of three New Year's celebrations in Honolulu, Hawaii, had onset of gastrointestinal illness. An investigation by the Epidemiology Branch of the Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) determined that the only common foods shared by participants were oysters and clams provided by one distributor. \nFamilial juvenile polyposis coli and colorectal cancer. A 40-year-old mother and her 7-year-old son underwent colectomy for polyposis coli. Both colectomy specimens contained predominantly juvenile polyps. The mother's specimen also had numerous tubular adenomas and one 5-cm severely dysplastic villous adenoma without invasive carcinoma. Foci of adenomatous change in juvenile polyps were present in the son's specimen. The histologic features of both cases suggest a sequence of change from juvenile polyps to adenomatous polyps to cancer. \nMesenteric infarction secondary to tumor emboli from primary aortic sarcoma. Guidelines for diagnosis and management. Primary aortic tumors are rare, difficult to diagnose, and often fatal. This case and a review of the literature identified aortic tumors as a potential source of emboli leading to acute mesenteric insufficiency. The case showed the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing and determining the extent and location of an aortic tumor. \nMDR1 gene expression and treatment outcome in acute myeloid leukemia To prospectively assess the role of MDR1 gene expression in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), levels of MDR1 RNA in blast cells were determined at diagnosis and correlated with treatment outcome in 63 patients. MDR1 RNA levels were negative in 29% and positive in 71% of the patients. The complete remission rate in response to induction chemotherapy was 89% for MDR1 RNA-negative patients and 53% for MDR1 RNA-positive patients (P = .008). Expression of the MDR1 gene was observed in most patients who died early or had resistant disease. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a decrease in both disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with detectable MDR1 gene expression compared with the disease-free survival and overall survival of MDR1 RNA-negative patients (P = .029 and P = .009, respectively). These data indicate that MDR1 gene expression is an unfavorable prognostic factor and suggest that multidrug resistance is important in AML. \nIncreased dopamine-induced nephrogenous cAMP formation in hypertension. Low doses of exogenous dopamine (3 micrograms/kg/min) were administered intravenously to nine patients with essential hypertension and to six age-matched healthy volunteers. During infusion with dopamine, mean arterial blood pressure decreased in hypertensive patients whereas it did not change in normotensive subjects. Basal levels of sodium excretion were comparable in hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The natriuretic response to dopamine was significantly greater in hypertensive patients. Urinary and nephrogenous cAMP significantly increased in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The increase of nephrogenous cAMP was more pronounced in hypertensive patients than in normotensive controls. A significant correlation was found between nephrogenous cAMP and sodium excretion. The enhanced natriuretic response to dopamine in hypertensive patients may be due to increased cAMP formation in response to tubular dopamine receptor stimulation. This is in agreement with the hypothesis of either up-regulation or affinity changes of renal dopamine receptors in patients with essential hypertension, secondary to a decreased endogenous production of intrarenal dopamine. \nSurveillance for recurrent stenosis after endovascular procedures. A prospective study. Eighty-nine endovascular procedures were performed during a 1-year period. Techniques included balloon angioplasty (n = 50), laser-assisted balloon angioplasty (n = 32), and atherectomy (n = 7). Indications were claudication (65.2%), critical ischemia (30.3%), and failing bypass (4.5%). Preoperative evaluation included a history and physical examination, segmental limb pressures, and color duplex ultrasonography. Postoperative surveillance consisted of a history and physical examination, ankle-arm indexes, and color duplex examinations at 1-week, 1-month, and then 3-month intervals. All levels of aortoiliac and infrainguinal disease were treated. Immediate technical success rate was 89.8%. Recurrence rates by life-table analysis reveal a 9-month patency rate of 45.4%. Early results of this prospective study indicate that endovascular procedures are subject to significant restenosis rates. Restraint is advised concerning general acceptance of endovascular procedures pending critical study. \nPain and vascular reflexes in man elicited by prolonged noxious mechano-stimulation. Interdigital webs of the hands of human volunteers were pinched for periods of 2 min duration to induce tonic pain perceptions. During stimulation, the subjects gave estimates of their pain level at 10-sec intervals on a visual analogue scale, and the stimulus induced changes of the skin blood flow in the stimulated hand was assessed by photo-plethysmography. Sustained pinching induced a tonic reflex vasoconstriction in the stimulated hand with rather slow adaptation rate and no signs of habituation between trials. Step increases of the pinching force in the course of a stimulus were reflected by a decrease in plethysmogram amplitude as well as by increased pain ratings, although the subjects were usually unaware of these steps. Lowering the stimulus strength induced opposite, albeit much smaller effects in both pain ratings and vascular reactions. It is concluded that the vasomotor responses described in this paper are mediated by nociceptor input and reflect the processing of this input mainly at a spinal level. \nStriking CT scan findings in a case of unilateral moyamoya disease--a case report. The authors report striking CT scan findings in a young woman with unilateral Moyamoya disease. Serial CT scans showed features that paralleled the clinical and pathophysiologic evolution of the disorder, in much the same way as has been reported in studies using serial angiograms. \nAcute delta hepatitis: serological diagnosis with particular reference to hepatitis delta virus RNA. To evaluate serologic diagnosis of hepatitis delta virus, we tested HDV RNA in stored sera from 48 patients with acute delta hepatitis who were identified with anti-HD antibodies. Initial sera were positive for HDV RNA in 27 of 48 (56%) patients. In comparison, isolated IgM anti-HD was present in 18 (38%) patients, although IgM and IgG anti-HD were present concurrently in 16 (33%) additional patients. Overall, either HDV RNA or IgM anti-HD was present in 69% of the initial sera. The HDV infection was self-limiting in all except two patients who died of fulminant hepatitis and nine others in whom chronic delta hepatitis ensued. Patterns of HDV seropositivity during progression to chronicity induced variable persistence, disappearance or recrudescence of either HDV RNA or IgM and IgG anti-HD. Results of HDV RNA and IgM anti-HD tests were concordant in only 40-50% of instances. Our results indicate that serological testing for HDV RNA is direct and will demonstrate HDV replication in a large number of cases with acute delta hepatitis. Testing for IgM anti-HD could provide supplemental evidence for HDV infection. Sequential testing for these markers will facilitate assessment of the outcome of acute HDV infection. \nThe endoscopic repair of choanal atresia. Since 1755, when choanal atresia was first described by Roederer, more than 300 papers have appeared in the literature dealing with various aspects of choanal atresia. Today's preferred methods of repair are transnasal and transpalatal. Each method has its advantages, disadvantages, proponents, and opponents. The main disadvantage of the transnasal procedure is limited vision, even with a microscope, especially in newborn infants, and the inability to adequately remove enough vomerine septal bone to prevent restenosis. Endoscopic transnasal repair of choanal atresia provides excellent visualization and the ability to perform exact surgery on patients of all ages. Described are four patients who underwent endoscopic repair of choanal atresia. Three of the four have patent nares, one patient after revision surgery. The technique is discussed along with its advantages and disadvantages relative to other surgical treatment modalities. \nAssessment of left atrial appendage function by transesophageal echocardiography. Implications for the development of thrombus. BACKGROUND. The predilection of the left atrial appendage (LAA) for thrombus formation has long been known. METHODS AND RESULTS. We prospectively studied the two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler patterns of LAA function in 82 patients by transesophageal echocardiography. In the 63 patients in sinus rhythm, LAA area was measured during LAA diastole at the onset of the electrocardiographic (ECG) P wave (LAAmax) and after LAA systole at the ECG R wave (LAAmin) and LAA ejection fraction was calculated as (LAAmax-LAAmin)/LAAmax; peak Doppler velocity was recorded from the LAA outlet. The 58 patients in sinus rhythm without LAA thrombus were grouped according to left atrial size on transthoracic echocardiography; 39 patients had a left atrial size of less than 40 mm (group 1) and 19 had a left atrial size of 40 mm or greater (group 2). Five patients in sinus rhythm had LAA thrombus. In the 19 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter LAAmax was measured independent of the ECG; three of these patients had LAA spontaneous contrast, four had thrombus, and one had both. Patients in sinus rhythm without LAA thrombus demonstrated a characteristic pattern of a contractile LAA apex and a noncontractile base with color flow and pulsed Doppler evidence of LAA emptying that coincided with the P wave. Patients in sinus rhythm with LAA thrombus had a mean +/- SD LAAmax (8.0 +/- 1.5 cm2) larger than that in group 1 (5.0 +/- 1.9 cm2) (p less than 0.01) but not group 2 (6.7 +/- 3.1 cm2), LAAmin (6.5 +/- 1.0 cm2) larger than that in both group 1 (2.3 +/- 1.5 cm2) and group 2 (4.2 +/- 2.7 cm2) (p less than 0.01), and LAA ejection fraction (17 +/- 11%) and LAA velocity (0.24 +/- 0.10 m/sec) less than those in both group 1 (55 +/- 21% and 0.48 +/- 0.24 m/sec, respectively) and group 2 (45 +/- 27% and 0.46 +/- 0.24 m/sec, respectively) (p less than 0.01). Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter with LAA spontaneous contrast and/or thrombus had LAAmax (10.4 +/- 6.6 cm2) greater than that in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter without LAA contrast and/or thrombus (6.8 +/- 3.0 cm2) (p less than 0.05). The LAA appeared as a static pouch in seven of eight of the former compared with in two of 11 of the latter. When attempted, Doppler demonstrated a recognizable fibrillatory LAA outflow velocity pattern in none of three in the former versus four of seven in the latter group. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the LAA has a characteristic pattern of emptying in sinus rhythm. LAA thrombus formation in sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation is associated with both poor LAA contraction and LAA dilation. \nSquare wave jerks in parkinsonian syndromes. The frequency of square wave jerks (SWJ) was compared in eight patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 25 patients with multiple system atrophy or Parkinson's disease plus (MSA/PP), 85 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 20 age-matched normal volunteers. In the control group, the mean (SD) SWJ frequency (SWJ larger than 1 degree amplitude) was 2.3 (2.4)/min. Abnormal ocular fixation (SWJ frequency greater than 10/min) was observed in a large proportion of PSP patients (7/8) and of MSA/PP patients (16/25) but in few PD patients (13/85). In the group of PD patients with abnormal ocular fixation, freezing of gait, falls and instability were more severe than in the group of PD patients with normal fixation. The study of ocular fixation may help to differentiate PD clinically from other Parkinsonian syndromes. SWJ are probably not related to the central degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway observed in PD. \nConsequences of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for Crohn's colitis. Patients with Crohn's colitis are generally not considered candidates for the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) procedure. We reviewed 362 consecutive patients undergoing IPAA and analyzed the outcome of this procedure on 25 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of mucosal ulcerative colitis who were subsequently proven to have Crohn's disease. The mean follow-up was 38.1 months. Sixteen patients have a functioning pouch, seven have required pouch excision, one is diverted, and one has died. Only one of nine patients in whom there was a preoperative clinical feature suggestive of Crohn's disease has a functioning pouch, with complications uniformly occurring within months of ileostomy closure. In contrast, 15 of 16 patients without preoperative features of Crohn's disease have maintained their pouch, generally with good results. These data suggest that patients in whom there is clinical and pathologic evidence of Crohn's disease do very poorly without meaningful symptom-free intervals. However, patients without any clinical features of Crohn's disease, despite a histopathologic diagnosis of Crohn's colitis, have had a good outcome with IPAA thus far. \nRoles of deoxycholate and arachidonate in pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones in obese patients during rapid loss of weight. Our aim was to examine the relationship between biliary deoxycholate and arachidonate in obese patients and the relationship of deoxycholate and arachidonate to the stimulation of biliary mucous glycoprotein among obese patients predisposed to cholesterol gallstones. Thirty-four obese patients predisposed to cholesterol gallstones by a weight-reducing diet (520 kcal/day) received placebo, ursodiol (1200 mg/day), or aspirin (1300 mg/day). Duodenal bile was collected prior to beginning the diet and at four weeks. There was no correlation between deoxycholate and arachidonate among the 34 patients before beginning the diet. With placebo, deoxycholate decreased while arachidonate and glycoprotein increased. With ursodiol, deoxycholate decreased while arachidonate decreased and glycoprotein did not change. With aspirin, there was no change in deoxycholate but a decrease in arachidonate and no change in glycoprotein. Our data do not support a role for biliary deoxycholate in the regulation of biliary arachidonate. Our data do support a role for arachidonate, but not deoxycholate, in the regulation of biliary glycoprotein during the formation of cholesterol gallstones. \nPsychiatric illness in patients with chronic fatigue and those with rheumatoid arthritis OBJECTIVES: To identify psychiatric differences between patients with chronic fatigue and those with rheumatoid arthritis and to investigate whether patients meeting Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) can be differentiated from patients with chronic fatigue on measures of disability and psychosocial distress. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study comparing 98 patients with chronic fatigue with 31 patients with rheumatoid arthritis on structured psychiatric interviews and patient questionnaires. Nineteen patients meeting CDC criteria for CFS were compared with 79 patients with chronic fatigue not meeting CDC criteria on questionnaires measuring disability and psychosocial distress. SETTING: Consecutive patients with chronic fatigue were selected from a chronic fatigue clinic at the University of Washington, and 31 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis were sampled from a private rheumatology practice. MAIN RESULTS: Patients with chronic fatigue had a significantly higher prevalence of lifetime major depression and somatization disorder than did patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with chronic fatigue also had a significantly higher prevalence of current and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. Only 19 of 98 patients with chronic fatigue met CDC criteria for CFS. Patients meeting CDC criteria for CFS could not be differentiated from the larger group of patients with chronic fatigue on any study variable. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic fatigue have a significantly higher burden of psychiatric illness than do patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The psychiatric illness preceded the development of chronic fatigue in over half the patients. Centers for Disease Control criteria for CFS did not select a subset of chronic fatigue patients who could be differentiated on disability or psychosocial parameters from patients with chronic fatigue who did not meet CDC criteria. \nOssifying fibromyxoid tumor of soft parts. Additional observations of a distinctive soft tissue tumor. The author studied four subcutaneous soft tissue tumors, similar to those recently described by Enzinger and associates (Am J Surg Pathol 1989;13:817) by the name \"ossifying fibromyxoid tumor,\" by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to further understand the cellular nature of this lesion. The four tumors were composed of uniform round cells often surrounded by a lacunar space. The tumors often contained a peripheral zone of metaplastic bone. The cellularity was high, but the mitotic rate was low, suggesting a benign or borderline nature of the lesion. Longer follow-up was available for three cases, showing recurrence-free survival times of 11, 8, and 3 years. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that all tumors were strongly positive for S-100 protein and focally positive for Leu-7, whereas melanoma-specific marker HMB45 was negative. Vimentin was the main type of intermediate filament protein, and one case also contained scattered glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells. Epithelial markers (keratins, epithelial membrane antigen), desmin, and muscle actins were negative. Electron microscopic examination showed partial, sometimes reduplicated, basal lamina surrounding many cells. Complex cell processes were also present. No myofilaments were found. The immunohistochemical and electron microscopic results may suggest that this tumor has Schwann's cell differentiation. \nMitral valve repair in the extensively calcified mitral valve annulus. Mitral valve replacement in patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus is associated with an increased risk of ventricular rupture. Until now techniques of mitral valve repair have not been applied to patients with a heavily calcified mitral valve annulus. We present 12 patients who underwent extensive decalcification of the annulus with subsequent mitral valve repair between 1987 and 1990. Ages ranged from 11 to 78 years; 6 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class II, 4 were in class III, and 2 were in class IV. All patients had varying degrees of mitral insufficiency. There were no deaths, reoperations, or thromboembolic events. Postoperative echocardiography revealed minimal residual mitral insufficiency in only 2 of 12 patients. All patients are currently in New York Heart Association class I or II. We believe mitral valve repair can be done safely on patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus, thus avoiding the risks of left ventricular rupture, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhagic complications associated with mitral valve replacement. \nIntrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia in children after selective dorsal root rhizotomy. The authors report their experience with low doses (0.007-0.015 mg/kg), moderate doses (0.016-0.025 mg/kg), and high doses (0.026-0.035 mg/kg) of intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia after selective dorsal root rhizotomy surgery in 50 children, aged 3 to 12 years. After closure of the dura, a single dose of preservative-free morphine was injected into the subarachnoid space, and patients were assessed for 48 hours for level of comfort and side effects. The three doses of morphine provided equivalent analgesia and similar side effects. The duration of postoperative analgesia ranged from 3 to 48 hours (mean, 12.2 +/- 9.5 h). Common side effects were limited to nausea and vomiting (42%) and mild facial pruritus. No patient experienced late respiratory depression or generalized pruritus. The authors conclude that low doses of intrathecal morphine is as effective as moderate or high doses of morphine for reducing pain in the immediate postoperative period. Intrathecal morphine provides excellent analgesia after selective dorsal rhizotomy. \nA novel technique for the evaluation of mechanical pain and hyperalgesia. We describe a new technique which is useful for the evaluation of mechanically induced pain and hyperalgesia. Light metal cylinders are guided and accelerated in a barrel. On impact against the skin they elicit a brief sensation of pain. This method allows the application of a wide range of controllable innocuous and noxious impact velocities of the cylinder at variable stimulus repetition rates. The system is sufficiently flexible to stimulate perpendicularly any skin area and to move rapidly to adjacent target regions if desired. Psychophysical testing using magnitude estimation techniques revealed that pain thresholds were normally distributed. Over a wide range of stimulation intensities monotonically increasing stimulus response functions were obtained. Repeated testing showed a good intra-individual reproducibility of both threshold and supramaximal pain ratings. The method was also useful in determining the time course of pain and mechanical hyperalgesia following a brief painful stimulus. We conclude that the new technique is useful for evaluating psychophysical stimulus response functions of mechanically induced pain and its changes following tissue injury. This technique may also hold some promise in quantifying altered pain sensitivity in patients. \nCloning of a leucine-zipper protein recognized by the sera of patients with antibody-associated paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Antibody-associated paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (the Yo syndrome) is an uncommon disorder in which an immune response is specifically directed against tumor tissue and the cerebellum. Screening of a lambda expression library has resulted in the isolation of cDNA clones that encode the major antigen recognized by serum from these patients. The fusion protein produced by the cDNA clones provides the basis of a simple diagnostic assay for this neurological syndrome. The occurrence of leucine-zipper and zinc-finger motifs in the predicted open reading frame suggests that this protein plays a role in the regulation of gene expression. \nEmergency management of blunt trauma in children. Apart from the trend to nonoperative treatment of blunt abdominal injuries, based on accurate CT diagnosis, most of the recent and anticipated changes in pediatric trauma are organizational. They include resuscitation and triage before hospitalization, the use of designated trauma centers, resuscitation by trauma teams, noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring, comprehensive pediatric intensive care, the use of objective measures of outcome, and improved rehabilitation programs (Templeton JM: personal communication). The treatment of individual cases is based on simple but well-established principles. The key steps in management are to recognize children with life-threatening injuries (on the basis of the mechanism of injury or a Pediatric Trauma Score less than or equal to 8 or a Revised Trauma Score less than or equal to 11), to support the function of vital organs by establishing and maintaining adequate respiratory gas exchange and circulation, and to identify all important injuries by thorough and ongoing assessment. \nInterpretation and clinical significance of the QRS axis of the electrocardiogram. The frontal plane QRS axis of the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is easily and accurately measured by the clinician. A simple method of estimating this axis is discussed. This axis is age-dependent. We reviewed the literature to determine if evidence exists of an association between an \"abnormal\" QRS axis and clinically significant myocardial disease. We also examined the literature for clinical correlation of a \"normal\" QRS axis with the absence of myocardial pathology. We found that although an abnormal QRS axis (falling outside the limits of +30 degrees and +90 degrees) occurs in a small number of normal individuals, its presence should prompt a thorough evaluation of all the parameters of the ECG to look for myocardial disease. \nExplicit memory and repetition priming in depression. Preliminary findings. Explicit memory and repetition priming, a form of implicit memory, were examined in depressed patients and controls. Explicit memory of depressed patients was severely impaired, whereas repetition priming was intact. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the impairment of memory in depression is linked to a failure of effort-demanding cognitive processes. Repetition priming might be useful in differentiating between depression and dementia. \nDelayed presentation and treatment of popliteal artery embolism. In the course of reviewing a 10-year experience with popliteal artery embolism (PAE), two distinct patterns of clinical presentation were identified. In addition to those patients presenting with typical acute (symptom duration less than 7 days) arterial ischemia, a second group was identified who presented with more chronic symptoms. The present study was conducted to contrast the clinical factors and treatment of these two temporal patterns of presentation with PAE. Sixty PAEs in 58 patients were documented by the combination of angiography and/or exploration of the popliteal artery. Acute presentation (AP) was seen in 41 (68%) of these and delayed presentation (DP) was noted in 19 (32%) patients. Delayed presentation patients typically presented with a history of sudden onset of claudication or rest pain and a median symptom duration of 30 days. Eighty per cent of AP patients presented with immediately threatened limbs. Angiography was generally diagnostic of chronic popliteal embolism. In the acute group, 90% were treated with embolectomy alone, while 20% of the DP group required bypass grafting. However in two thirds of the DP group, embolectomy alone performed through a direct popliteal approach was possible. Current results with overall limb salvage (92%) and mortality (7%) represents a substantial improvement compared to the authors' previous experience with PAE. The current study suggests that as many as one third of patients with popliteal artery embolism may present in delayed fashion with chronic symptoms. Furthermore most of these patients can be treated with direct popliteal embolectomy alone with favorable results. \nA phase IA trial of sequential administration recombinant DNA-produced interferons: combination recombinant interferon gamma and recombinant interferon alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study investigated the effects of sequentially administered recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) and recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN alpha) in 36 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). rIFN alpha was subcutaneously administered daily for 70 days at dosages that varied (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 x 10(6) U/m2) across four cohorts of patients. Within each cohort of patients receiving a given dose of rIFN alpha, three subsets of patients received either 30, 300, or 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. rIFN gamma was administered intravenously for 5 days every third week, 6 hours prior to administration of rIFN alpha. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included constitutional symptoms, leukopenia, nephrotic syndrome with acute renal failure, hypotension associated with death, and congestive heart failure. DLT was related more often to the rIFN alpha dose level than to rIFN gamma dose level. Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 10 x 10(6) U/m2 rIFN alpha and 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. Six patients failed to complete a minimum of 21 days of therapy due to toxicity or rapid progression of disease. Clinical responses were seen in eight of 30 assessable patients. Two patients experienced complete remission and have remained in complete remission 20+ and 22+ months. An additional six patients have shown partial responses for 4 to 18+ months. One patient in partial remission continues to show slow regression of pulmonary and liver lesions off therapy with rIFNs. Clinical responses have remained durable for patients with complete remissions and patients with partial remissions. The results of this study suggest that toxicities associated with combination rIFN therapy can be reduced by administering these agents sequentially as opposed to simultaneously. \nRadiologic recommendation for breast biopsy on screening mammography reports. Radiologic reports on screening mammography findings often obligate breast biopsy. Ready recommendation for biopsy of nonpalpable lesions imaged by x ray is a conservative radiologic policy but is unsettling for patients and creates an imperative bind for surgeons. Like the decision to send the patient with right lower quadrant abdominal pain home rather than to the operating room, the diagnosis that requires clinical confidence and precision is nonappendicitis. Noncancer of the breast is a similar diagnosis that can usually be made on clinical and mammographic findings rather than passing such patients through to invasive diagnosis. A series of 84 patients was referred for needle localization of nonpalpable mammographically detected lesions called suspicious on screening examination. Of these 84 patients, new radiographic reports reinterpreting the findings without biopsy were written on the original mammogram in 15 patients. This is a cancellation rate of 21 per cent. In 69 patients needle localization was carried out with the finding of cancer in 28 per cent, compared with the national average of 15 per cent. This higher than average yield caused concern whether any unbiopsied cancers had been followed, and a review of these patients was undertaken. In the log of patients referred for needle localization, the prereading by the mammographer performing the needle localization was recorded in advance of biopsy confirmation, and specificity proved to be 94 per cent and sensitivity 96 per cent. Of the cancers that were detected, 39 per cent were proven in patients older than 50 years. \nOvernight studies in severe chronic left heart failure: arrhythmias and oxygen desaturation. Overnight studies were performed in 10 patients with severe chronic left heart failure (New York Heart Association grades III and IV) without pulmonary disease and in eight controls. Transcutaneous oxygen (Po2) and carbon dioxide tensions (Pco2) and oxygen saturation were measured and the electro-cardiogram was recorded. During sleep mean oxygen saturation fell to 92.7% (minimum 86.1%) from 95.1% when awake. During the night oxygen saturation was below 95% for 62% of the time, below 90% for 6% of the time, and below 85% for 1% of the time. In four patients there were oxygen desaturation dips (a fall of greater than 4% in ox",
