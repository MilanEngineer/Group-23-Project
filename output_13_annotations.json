        "text": "a thrombosed vessel at surgery, whereas five patients without portal venous flow at sonography had patent vessels at angiography (one patient) or surgery (four patients). Overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of portal vein thrombosis were 89% and 92%, with an accuracy of 92%, a false-negative rate of 0.11, a negative predictive value of 0.98, and a positive predictive value of 0.62. We postulate that the majority of errors in our study occurred in vessels that, although patent, had only sluggish flow, which could not be resolved because of technical limitations. We conclude that color Doppler imaging is a valuable screening procedure for the assessment of portal vein patency. If the sonogram shows a patent portal vein, no further studies are required. However, a lack of demonstrable flow does not always indicate thrombosis, and other imaging studies should be performed for confirmation. \nLocal control and survival from the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group studies of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and the Vienna Bone Tumor Registry. The use of aggressive chemotherapy undoubtedly has brought about a dramatic increase in the cure rate of osteosarcoma. The authors' investigations have increased the authors' knowledge of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, the differential efficacy of currently used agents, and the pronounced schedule dependency and relative route independency of their efficiency. The authors were able to confirm the prognostic significance of tumor response after preoperative chemotherapy. Preoperative chemotherapy in itself has facilitated and promoted limb-salvage surgery. Also, more patients can be cured today by use of aggressive thoracic surgery in case of primary or secondary pulmonary metastases. The authors' efforts to steadily increase metastasis-free survival rates by intensifying chemotherapy in this series of studies, however, have been only moderately successful. Still, chemotherapy-related acute toxicity is considerable and increases with aggressiveness of treatment, and the manifestations of late toxicity may continue to increase with follow-up time. Future trials should be targeted toward exploration of the minimum indispensable amount of toxic treatment yielding comparable or even better results than those currently attainable. \nRupture of the posterior wall of the left ventricle after mitral valve replacement. During a 20 year period from 1970 to 1989, 1100 patients underwent mitral valve replacement. Rupture of the posterior wall of the left ventricle occurred in seven patients (0.6%); four in the operating room and three in the postoperative room. It was possible to institute CP bypass in six patients and in all of them bleeding was controlled successfully, with repair by an external approach. Only one patient survived. We believe that institution of CP bypass and reinfusion of cardioplegic solution is a major determinant of the outcome. \nHeterogeneity of immunotypes of heat-labile enterotoxins of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli of human origin. A new technique, checkerboard immunoblotting (CBIB), has been applied to detect and to differentiate heat-labile enterotoxins, (LTs), from enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli of human origin using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Optimal conditions of production and release of LTs were defined using CBIB. LT release was enhanced when E. coli cells were treated with 8 M urea. LT production was highest when E. coli strains were incubated with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 degrees C for 12 h in CAYE-2 medium. Two hundred and five strains of E. coli, isolated from patients with diarrhea in Japan, Thailand, the United States, Mexico, and Brazil, were examined for LT. Of 133 LT-positive strains, 4 (3%) produced an LT that reacted like H-LT-1 (originally isolated from E. coli strain H-74-114) while 126 strains (94.7%) produced LT that reacted like H-LT-2 (originally isolated from strain H-10407) or H-LT-3 (from strain H-240-3). Three strains of human origin (2.3%) produced an LT that reacted like P-LT (produced by E. coli strains of porcine origin). This study shows that CBIB, a simple, efficient, and practical assay, might be useful for epidemiologic surveys and for evaluation of serologic responses to LTs and antitoxic vaccines. \nRole of von Willebrand factor in arterial thrombosis. Studies in normal and von Willebrand disease pigs. With normal and von Willebrand disease (vWD) pigs, we studied the role of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in platelet-vessel wall interactions and occlusive arterial thrombosis. Two methods of arterial injury have been used to determine the thrombotic response of flowing blood in vivo. The first involves balloon catheter injury. After superficial denudation of endothelium from coronary intima, platelets adhere to the subendothelium in a monolayer. Similar numbers of adherent platelets are found in both phenotypes, but platelets in vWD pigs have impaired pseudopod formation and are less well spread morphological indexes of limited platelet activation. Deeper injury, which involves the media, produces nonocclusive platelet-fibrin microthrombi. The second injury method involves pinching the artery at a site of superimposed stenosis, a procedure that almost always exposes media. This procedure induces platelet-fibrin microthrombi in normal and vWD pigs, but only normal pigs develop occlusive thrombosis. Both methods of arterial injury have also been performed in normal and vWD pigs with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis promotes platelet spread in vWD pigs but does not abolish the protection from stenosis and injury-induced occlusive thrombosis. In addition, neutralization of vWF activity in normal pigs by a monoclonal antibody prevents the induction of occlusive thrombosis by the stenosis and pinch-injury procedure. This monoclonal antibody also causes performed platelet aggregates to break up. These experimental models of inducing arterial thrombosis have been used in normal and vWD pigs to demonstrate interactions between normal and atherosclerotic vessel wall constituents, circulating platelets and vWF that are fundamental in the process of arterial thrombosis. \nSerum zinc, copper, and selenium levels in inflammatory bowel disease: effect of total enteral nutrition on trace element status. Serum levels of zinc, copper, and selenium, and alkaline phosphatase activity were prospectively studied in 29 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Fifteen patients had extensive active colitis (active colitis group). Seven patients had active, and seven cases inactive small bowel or ileocecal Crohn's disease (small bowel disease group). Ninety-three healthy subjects acted as controls. Serum trace element levels were considered in relation to vitamin A and E levels, nutritional parameters, the activity of the disease, and the recent intake of steroids. The effect of total enteral nutrition on serum trace elements was studied in seven cases. Serum zinc levels were lower and serum copper levels higher in the active colitis group than in controls (p = 0.0007, and p = 0.02, respectively). More than 50% of patients with active colonic or small bowel disease showed zinc levels below the 15th percentile of the control group. Serum zinc levels correlated with plasma vitamin A in acute colitis (r = 0.67; p = 0.006), and with both serum albumin concentration (r = 0.76; p = 0.002) and disease activity score (r = -0.67, p = 0.009) in patients with small bowel disease. The copper:zinc ratio was higher in the active colitis group than in controls (p = 0.002). In spite of the increase in serum albumin levels and the decrease in disease activity, serum zinc levels remained low after total enteral nutrition. The implications of the abnormal trace element status in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are discussed. \nTranexamic acid treatment of hemothorax in two patients with malignant mesothelioma. Patients with malignant mesothelioma may present with hemothorax. We used a combination of oral and intrapleural tranexamic acid to treat two patients with this severe complication. Initiation of treatment with this potent anti-fibrinolytic drug resulted in rapid reduction of bleeding and of transfusion requirements. \nPeripheral nerve lesions in hemophilia. Between 1962 and 1986, eighty-one of the 1351 admissions of patients who had hemophilia to the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre were for peripheral nerve lesions. Eighty-eight such lesions were identified in fifty-four patients, and thirty-nine of these patients (sixty-one lesions) had adequate follow-up (mean, 8.4 years; range, four months to eighteen years). The femoral nerve was most commonly involved, but involvement of other peripheral nerves also occurred. In thirty (49 per cent) of the sixty-one lesions, the nerve had full motor and sensory recovery; in twenty-one (34 per cent), a residual sensory deficit; and in ten (16 per cent), both a persistent motor and sensory deficit. Patients who had antibodies to factor VIII were significantly less likely to recover full motor or sensory function than were those who did not have such antibodies, and the time to full motor recovery in these patients was significantly longer. \nMammography in the management of patients with small breast cancers. Findings on mammography resulted in a change of treatment policy in 17 of 200 patients with small breast cancers (T1/T2 less than 4 cm, N0/N1, M0). Twelve patients were considered unsuitable for conservation therapy because of mammographic evidence of either extensive in situ carcinoma or more than one focus of invasive carcinoma. These patients were treated by mastectomy and histology confirmed widespread in situ carcinoma or multifocal/multicentric invasive carcinoma. Seven patients were found to have unsuspected contralateral lesions on mammography, of which five were subsequently shown to be malignant. Routine preoperative mammography is essential in the management of patients with small breast cancers. \nTreating insulin resistance in hypertension with metformin reduces both blood pressure and metabolic risk factors. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia may play an important role in both the development of hypertension and its accompanying metabolic aberrations. In order to investigate this possibility, nine non-obese, non-diabetic, non-smoking, middle-aged men with untreated hypertension were treated with metformin 850 mg b.i.d. for 6 weeks as a pilot study and within-patient comparison. Metformin decreased total and LDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.01), triglyceride (P less than 0.01), fasting plasma insulin (P less than 0.01) and C-peptide levels (P less than 0.02). Glucose disposal, an indicator of insulin action measured by means of the euglycaemic clamp technique, increased (P less than 0.001). Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity increased (P less than 0.02), and t-PA antigen decreased (P less than 0.01), whereas plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and fibrinogen were unaffected by metformin treatment. Body weight remained unchanged. Withdrawal of metformin was associated with the return of both blood pressure and metabolism towards the initial levels. In conclusion, metformin treatment increased insulin action, lowered blood pressure, improved the metabolic risk factor profile and tended to increase the fibrinolytic activity in these mildly hypertensive subjects. These results support the view that insulin resistance plays a role in hypertension, and may open up a new field for the alleviation of abnormalities associated with cardiovascular disease. \nGeneralized cortical dysplasia. Clinical and pathologic aspects. Three children with profound mental retardation and intractable seizures died at ages 10 months, 3 years, and 7 years, respectively. Complete examination of their brains showed generalized cortical dysplasia, without any major malformation of the external gyral pattern. The neuropathologic features of cortical dysplasia include abnormally thickened cortex with indistinct demarcation of the gray-white matter junction. In many areas, the cortex contained increased numbers of large neurons with disordered cortical lamination. Heterotopic neurons were scattered throughout the white matter with decreased myelination of the underlying white matter. To our knowledge, these cases represent the first fully detailed neuropathologic study of diffuse cortical dysplasia--a newly recognized entity of abnormal neuronal migration. \nAlcohol induction of ferritin expression in a human hepatoblastoma cell line (HEP G2). Hyperferritinemia, an unclear mechanism, is frequently observed in chronic alcoholics. The aim of this work was to study the effect of alcohol on ferritin expression in a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2. This cell line proved to be sensitive to alcohol, since alcohol increased gamma-GT activity both in cells and media. The most striking result was the increase of ferritin in cells and media by alcohol. Moreover, this effect was specific, since it contrasted with a decrease in total protein synthesis and secretion, a decrease in transferrin excretion and a lack of effect on orosomucoid. In our model, alcohol was able to induce, in a specific manner, ferritin expression. \nComparison of the findings on preoperative dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography: implications regarding the identification of myocardium at ischemic risk. The evidence of myocardium at potential ischemic risk on preoperative dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy was compared with that of manifest ischemia on intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in 26 patients at high risk of a coronary event undergoing noncardiac surgery. The clinical outcome was also assessed. Induced intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were more common in patients and myocardial segments with, than in those without, a preoperative reversible perfusion defect (both p less than 0.05). Conversely, a preoperative reversible perfusion defect was more common in patients and segments with, than in those without, a new intraoperative wall motion abnormality (both p less than 0.05). Six patients, five with a reversible scintigraphic defect but only three with a new wall motion abnormality, had a hard perioperative ischemic event. Events occurred more often among patients with, than in those without, a reversible perioperative scintigraphic defect (5 [33%] of 15 vs. 1 [9%] of 11) but this difference did not reach significance (p = 0.14), probably owing to the sample size. Intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were all reversible and did not differentiate between risk groups; these findings were possibly influenced by treatment. These preliminary data support the known relation between reversible scintigraphic defects and perioperative events and identify another manifestation of ischemic risk in the relation between reversible scintigraphic defects and induced intraoperative wall motion abnormalities. The value of intraoperative echocardiography in identifying ischemia and guiding therapy in patients with a reversible scintigraphic abnormality should be further assessed. \nRecognition, management, and prevention of Clostridium septicum abscess in immunosuppressed patients. Spontaneous gas gangrene due to Clostridium septicum is a rapidly progressing disease that usually ends in fatal toxemia. We report three cases of asymptomatic C septicum abscesses to document the clinical course of this entity and to establish guidelines for its prevention and treatment. In contrast to previously reported data, C septicum infections can produce abscesses in solid organs, the retroperitoneum, and the extremities. These lesions often occur in patients with cancer, producing liver abscesses without gas formation that may be misinterpreted as metastatic carcinoma. Symptoms may be minimal or nonspecific before fulminant toxemia. Asymptomatic bacteremia should prompt a search for unsuspected cancer and an abscess. Computed tomography is the diagnostic modality of choice. The treatment consists of surgical debridement of necrotic tissue in concert with an appropriate course of antibiotics. We have found recurrences after adequate debridement and short-term antibiotic therapy, suggesting that prolonged and even lifelong prophylactic oral penicillin G potassium may be necessary to prevent further recurrences. \nTime course of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction after endotoxin infusion in unanesthetized sheep. Endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] has been reported to reduce hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and thus increases venous admixture. The time course of this failure of pulmonary blood flow regulation was investigated in six chronically instrumented unanesthetized sheep after infusion of Escherichia coli LPS (1 microgram/kg). The change in left pulmonary arterial blood flow (LPBF, ultrasonic transit time) in response to unilateral lung hypoxia (10 min of N2 alternately to the left and right lungs) was compared before and at various time intervals after the administration of LPS. During baseline conditions, LPBF was 33% of total cardiac output and decreased to 15% when the left lung was ventilated with a hypoxic gas mixture. One hour after endotoxin infusion, LPBF remained at 33% of total cardiac output yet only decreased to 28% during the hypoxic challenge. The response to one-lung hypoxia was still significantly depressed 10 h post-LPS administration. It is concluded that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is almost completely abolished for a prolonged time period after a small dose of LPS. \nAnterograde amnesia with fornix damage following removal of IIIrd ventricle colloid cyst. Two patients developed anterograde amnesia following the apparently uncomplicated transcallosal-transventricular removal of a colloid cyst. Damage to the fornical columns was demonstrated on CT and MRI scans, whilst other memory related structures were entirely normal. Longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation, over 12-24 months, has revealed a very similar pattern of deficit in the two cases: verbal memory has remained persistently impaired whilst nonverbal anterograde memory has improved to some degree. Formal tests of remote public (famous faces and events) and personal autobiographical memory have supported the clinical impression that neither patient has a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. These findings address the role of the fornix, and the dissociation of memory processes in humans. \nChanges in upper airway resistance during progressive normocapnic hypoxia in normal men. The effects of normocapnic progressive hypoxia on nasal and pharyngeal resistances were evaluated in nine normal men. To calculate resistances, upper airway pressures were measured with two low-bias flow catheters; one was placed at the tip of the epiglottis and the other in the posterior nasopharynx, and we measured flow with a Fleish no. 3 pneumotachograph connected to a tightly fitting mask. Both resistances were obtained during a baseline period and during progressive normocapnic hypoxia achieved by a rebreathing method. We collected the breath-by-breath values of upper airway resistances, minute ventilation, O2 and CO2 fractions, arterial O2 saturation (SaO2), and changes in functional residual capacity (inductance vest). The central respiratory drive was evaluated by the mouth occlusion pressure 0.1 s after the onset of inspiration (P0.1), and breath-by-breath P0.1 values were estimated by intrapolation from the linear relationship between P0.1 and SaO2. In each subject both resistances decreased during the hypoxic test. The slope of the decrease in resistance with decreasing SaO2 (%baseline/%SaO2) was steeper for pharyngeal resistance than for nasal resistance [2.67 +/- 0.29 and 1.61 +/- 0.25 (SE), respectively; P less than 0.05]. The slope of the decrease in resistance with increasing P0.1 (%baseline/cmH2O) was -0.24 +/- 0.05 for nasal resistance and -0.39 +/- 0.07 for pharyngeal resistance (P less than 0.05). Functional residual capacity progressively increased during the test, but the decrease in resistance was greater than expected from an isolated increase in lung volume. We conclude that nasal and pharyngeal resistances decrease during progressive normocapnic hypoxia. \nLong-term angiographic follow-up after angioplasty of venous coronary bypass grafts. From April 1981 to June 1987, 57 patients underwent venous coronary bypass graft percutaneous angioplasty and had a minimal follow-up of 18 months. The procedure was elective for 28 patients, urgent for 19, and was considered as an emergency for 10. A total of 64 grafts were dilated that had been bypassed 58 +/- 48 months previously (range 2 to 184 months); lesions were located on the aortic anastomosis in 12 grafts, on the body in 38, and on the coronary anastomosis in 14. Technical success was 95.3% (61 of 64) per lesion; clinical success was 84.4% (54 of 64) per lesion and 82.5% (47 of 57) per patient. Thrombotic complications with images of a lacunar defect occurred in 11 grafts (17.2%). Predictive factors for these complications were: age of grafts 38.5% for greater than 60 month grafts versus 2.6% for less than 60 month grafts (p less than 0.01); site of lesion, body lesion 28.9% versus anastomosis none (p less than 0.01); type of lesion, concentric and short 6% versus other 29% (p less than 0.05); and recent fibrinolysis in 66% versus 10.6% (p less than 0.05). Long-term follow-up is available in the 47 successful patients and the three limited non-Q wave myocardial infarction patients. Two patients died at 13 and 17 months. Long-term angiographic follow-up is available in 45 of 48 patients or 94%. At the end of the study, 35 of 57 (61.4%) venous bypass grafts in 32 patients (64%) were patent after one or more percutaneous transluminal angioplasties. \nDifferences in \"primary response\" gene expression in renal compensatory hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The induction of a family of primary response genes (ie, genes whose transcription is not dependent on new protein synthesis) occurs within minutes after stimulation of quiescent 3T3 cells by phorbol esters and growth factors. A similar pattern of gene expression is seen in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells induced to differentiate by nerve growth factor (NGF), suggesting that a common set of activating signals occur in different forms of cell growth. To determine whether the same \"activation\" process occurs in renal hypertrophy, we measured mRNA levels in mice subjected to uninephrectomy (UNX) or sham operation. Regenerative renal hyperplasia was induced by intraperitoneal folic acid (FA) injection with vehicle as control. Northern blots showed induction of these genes by FA with elevated mRNA levels persisting for up to 24 to 48 hours. UNX and sham operation demonstrated a slight and transient elevation of mRNA levels, with a prompt return to basal levels by 60 minutes. \nLong-term psychologic implications of congenital heart disease: a 25-year follow-up. Patients with various types of congenital heart disease were contacted 25 years after their original examination at the Mayo Clinic. In addition to providing their current health status, level of education achieved, and current occupation, they were asked to complete a detailed standardized questionnaire to assess their degree of psychologic stress. Of the original 463 patients, 168 completed and returned the psychologic questionnaires. These patients had evidence of psychologic stress in excess of that expected on the basis of normative data. Furthermore, the degree of stress was unrelated to the clinical severity of the original cardiac defect. In addition, the psychologic stress occurred despite \"success\" as defined by educational achievement and occupational level. One can speculate that as children these patients were exposed to environmental stresses that may well have been colored by parental attitudes and perceptions. \nSpinal epidural hematoma causing cord compression after tissue plasminogen activator and heparin therapy. Bleeding is the most serious complication of thrombolytic therapy and limits its usefulness. We have reported a case of epidural hematoma, a rare occurrence after combined therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and heparin. We emphasize that in patients treated with thrombolytic agents, any trauma may increase the risk of bleeding. The sudden onset of back pain and neurologic deficits should alert the clinician to the possibility of spinal hematoma with cord compression. \nCerebral edema causing death in children with maple syrup urine disease. Four children with the classic form of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) died of cerebral edema during an intercurrent infection that caused severe dehydration and acidosis. The diagnosis of MSUD had been established during the neonatal period in all four patients, on day 1 of life in three of them. All were in satisfactory control before the intercurrent illness. Two patients underwent peritoneal dialysis. Signs of brain-stem compression occurred after treatment, when biochemical abnormalities were improving. Computed tomography of the head, which was done in two patients, revealed cerebral edema; one of these patients also had subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autopsy in one case revealed cerebral edema with herniation. Our experience documents that cerebral edema may occur in the older child with MSUD as well as in the neonate. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema in MSUD remains unclear. Early treatment of dehydration and acidosis may prevent the catastrophic consequences that we have observed. \nThe association of frequent headaches with personality and life events. The associations between personality traits, life events and frequent headaches were studied in a sample of 5766 adult subjects between 20 and 65 years of age from the general population. Subjects with at least weekly headaches had more life events and higher inadequacy, social inadequacy, rigidity and injuredness than subjects with less frequent headaches. These relationships were not observed in subjects of 50 years of age and older, with the exception of the association with inadequacy. From the traits measured, inadequacy had the highest odds ratios for frequent headaches and showed a modest interaction with the presence of a life event. These findings are in agreement with Sarason's interactional model. \nInflammation at the neuromuscular junction in myasthenia gravis. To better define the pathogenic mechanisms in the antibody-mediated autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (MG), we analyzed the morphology and electrophysiology of the neuromuscular junction in anconeus muscle biopsy specimens from eight patients with MG and seven control subjects. There were inflammatory cells at the neuromuscular junction in seven of the eight biopsies from MG patients. The endplate index (length of the postsynaptic membrane divided by the length of the apposed presynaptic membrane) was abnormally reduced in all the MG patients, and fiber type grouping, suggestive of reinnervation, was present in six of the eight MG patients. Intracellular recording revealed diminished amplitude of miniature endplate potentials and miniature endplate currents in the MG patients compared with the controls. The time constant of decay of miniature endplate currents did not differ from that of controls, suggesting no change in mean channel open time of the acetylcholine receptor. The endplate receptor sensitivity to iontophoretically applied acetylcholine was also decreased in MG patients compared with controls. The quantal content of neurally evoked endplate potentials was reduced in six of the eight MG patients, demonstrating abnormal presynaptic function as well. The presence of inflammatory cells at the neuromuscular junctions of limb muscles in MG reconciles an apparent disparity between the animal model of MG, experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, and the human disease. This study also demonstrates a frequent presynaptic component to the abnormal neuromuscular transmission in MG. \nOn lowering lipids in the post-infarction patient. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) elevated serum cholesterol levels, like other classical risk factors, remain predictive of further coronary events. The excess risk attributable to raised cholesterol levels is considerable, and greater than that in subjects without CHD. A recent meta-analysis of all eight qualifying trials of secondary prevention of CHD by cholesterol lowering is reviewed. There were significant reductions in recurrent non-fatal and fatal CHD, with a downward trend in total mortality. Mechanisms underlying the relationship between cholesterol lowering and secondary prevention are reviewed. The implication of this analysis of trials for clinical practice is that hypercholesterolaemia should be sought and effectively treated in patients with CHD, unless contraindications are present. \nGlutathione peroxidase deficiency and childhood seizures. 4 children with intractable seizures, repeated infections, and intolerance to anticonvulsants had evidence of glutathione peroxidase deficiency. 2 had low intracellular enzyme activity but normal blood selenium and high plasma glutathione peroxidase concentrations. The other 2 had low intracellular glutathione peroxidase activity with low circulating glutathione peroxidase and selenium concentrations. The clinical state of the children improved after discontinuation of anticonvulsant medication and selenium substitution. \nPolysialic acid of the neural cell adhesion molecule distinguishes small cell lung carcinoma from carcinoids. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) exists in various types of neuroendocrine cells and their tumors. A typical feature of NCAM is polysialic acid, of which the chain length is developmentally regulated. The authors have performed a comparative immunohistochemical study on small cell lung carcinomas and bronchial as well as gastrointestinal carcinoids with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 735 reactive with the long-chain form of polysialic acid. The small cell lung carcinomas, irrespective of their histological type, were positive for polysialic acid. Metastatic tumor cell complexes also exhibited immunostaining. The tumor cell-surface-associated immunostaining for polysialic acid was sensitive to endoneuraminidase. The mature and atypical bronchial and gastrointestinal carcinoids were not immunoreactive for polysialic acid. Cytoplasmic staining in groups of cells of carcinoids (2 of 28 cases) was due to nonspecific antibody binding, which could be prevented by increased ion strength. These data indicate that neuroendocrine tumors of the lung can be distinguished by their content of highly sialylated NCAM. \nMalignant tumors of the eye in geriatric patients. The ocular tissues can be the site of a number of malignant tumors in adults and geriatric patients. In addition to posing a threat to the patient's life, these tumors can cause severe visual loss or blindness. Therefore, the primary care clinician should be capable of prompt diagnosis of the various malignant ocular tumors and be prepared to refer the patient for appropriate management. This article provides a photographic guide to the most common primary and secondary malignancies that can affect the eyelid, conjunctiva, intraocular structures, and orbit in the geriatric patient. \nRestenosis after coronary angioplasty: a multivariate statistical model to relate lesion and procedure variables to restenosis. The M-HEART Investigators. The Multi-Hospital Eastern Atlantic Restenosis Trial group obtained follow-up angiography in 510 patients with 598 successfully dilated coronary lesions who were enrolled in a controlled trial of the effects of a single dose of 1 g of methylprednisolone on restenosis after coronary angioplasty. The overall restenosis rate was 39.6%. The strongest univariate relations to the restenosis rate were found for lesion location (saphenous vein graft, 68%; left anterior descending artery, 45%; left circumflex artery and right coronary artery, 32%; p = 0.002); lesion length (less than or equal to 4.6 mm, 33%; greater than 4.6 mm, 45%; p = 0.001); percent stenosis before angioplasty (less than or equal to 73%, 25%; greater than 73%, 43%; p = 0.005), percent stenosis after angioplasty (less than or equal to 21%, 33%; greater than 21%, 46%; p = 0.017) and arterial diameter (less than 2.9 mm, 44%; greater than or equal to 2.9 mm, 34%; p = 0.036). Two multivariate models to predict restenosis probability were developed with use of stepwise logistic regression. The preprocedural model, which included only variables whose values were known before angioplasty, entered lesion length, vein graft location, left anterior descending artery location, percent stenosis before angioplasty, eccentric lesion and arterial diameter. The postprocedural model, which also included variables whose values were known after angioplasty was performed, was similar to the preangioplasty model except that it also entered postangioplasty percent stenosis and \"optimal\" balloon sizing but did not enter eccentric lesion. These data indicate that the probability of restenosis after angioplasty is determined predominantly by the characteristics of the lesion being dilated. They are consistent with the known intimal proliferative mechanism of restenosis, offer a means of identifying lesions at unusually high or low risk of restenosis, and of predicting the likelihood that a particular lesion will restenose after angioplasty and provide a rationale for stratification by restenosis probability in the design of future studies of restenosis. \nPrenatal diagnosis of fetal left ventricular aneurysm: a case report and review. Fetal echocardiography in a 30-year-old black woman, gravida 4, para 3, demonstrated left ventricular aneurysm. This was confirmed by color flow pulsed Doppler techniques. After delivery, neonatal echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging further confirmed the diagnosis. The infant was followed closely and underwent surgical correction at 8.5 months of age. Before surgery, cardiac catheterization demonstrated normal hemodynamic function. A review of the literature revealed a paucity of information. Issues of prenatal diagnosis, antenatal surveillance, method of delivery, and neonatal follow-up are not well defined in either the obstetric or pediatric cardiology literature. A rationale for our approach to this complex problem is presented. \nCommunity obstetric care in West Berkshire OBJECTIVE--To assess the effects of a revised obstetric booking policy whereby all low risk pregnant women received their antenatal care entirely in the community. DESIGN--Comparison of the distribution of antenatal clinic attendances, transfers, and perinatal mortality rates for 1987 and 1989, before and after introduction of the revised policy. SETTING--West Berkshire Health District. SUBJECTS--All women who delivered with a registrable birth in the district in 1987 (5817 women) and 1989 (5372). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Attendances at community and consultant antenatal clinics; bookings transferred from community care to consultant care; perinatal mortality rates. RESULTS--Of 5372 women delivering in West Berkshire in 1989, 3185 (58.3%) were originally booked for general practitioner-midwife care, of whom 1567 (49.2% of general practitioner-midwife bookings) were transferred to consultant care. 1618 women (30.1% of all women delivered) received their entire obstetric care from general practitioners and midwives. Attendance at hospital antenatal clinics was reduced by 16%. In 1989 the perinatal mortality rates (1987 values) for the district were 6.3 (7.6) per 1000 births overall; 8.2 (8.3) per 1000 consultant bookings; 5.0 (4.7) per 1000 for community bookings; and 10.2 (14.4) per 1000 for women transferred to consultant care. CONCLUSION--Antenatal care of low risk pregnant women may safely be provided by their general practitioner and midwife. \nOutcome of psychogenic seizures in children and adolescents compared with adults. We compared outcome of psychogenic seizures documented by video-EEG in 18 nonepileptic children and adolescents (ages 8 to 18; median, 14.5 years old) and 20 adults (ages 25 to 56; median, 34.0 years old). Outcome was significantly better for the younger patients at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after diagnosis. At these follow-up times, the percentages of children and adolescents free of psychogenic attacks were 73%, 75%, and 81%; at the same follow-up times, the percentages of adults free of psychogenic attacks were only 25%, 25%, and 40%. Factors leading to better outcome for younger patients may have been different psychological mechanisms at different ages of onset and greater effectiveness with earlier intervention. \nCriteria for the diagnosis of migraine in clinical practice. Criteria for the diagnosis of migraine have evolved from generalized descriptions to specific rules designed to ensure the selection of homogenous groups of patients for research studies. For clinical practice, the former are insufficiently specific and the latter are too complex. For care of headache patients by primary care physicians, we propose that the diagnosis of migraine without aura (common migraine) is warranted if any two of the following symptoms are present: unilateral site, throbbing quality, nausea, photophobia or phonophobia. These criteria are derived from a study comparing the features of 100 patients with migraine without aura and 100 patients with chronic daily headache. The proposed criteria for the diagnosis of migraine without aura were highly sensitive and adequately specific in discriminating groups. These simple criteria should facilitate the diagnosis of migraine by primary care physicians. \nUse of secondary prophylaxis against myocardial infarction in the north of England OBJECTIVE--To record the use of secondary prophylactic drugs in patients discharged from hospital having had a myocardial infarction. DESIGN--Prospective postal questionnaire survey of a random one in two sample of general practitioners in the region. SETTING--The nine family practitioner committee areas within the Northern Regional Health Authority. PATIENTS--Patients who had had a myocardial infarction and were discharged to their general practitioner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Whether beta blockers or aspirin, or both, were given on discharge. RESULTS--Of 267 patients, 158 (59%) were treated suboptimally in that they did not receive a secondary prophylactic drug to which they had no contraindication. For most patients this entailed underuse of one drug, but 17 (6%) of patients received no treatment. beta Blockers were 2.5 times less likely to be used than aspirin. Treatment was not associated with the age or sex of the patient, risk of further infarction, or hospital of discharge. CONCLUSIONS--Secondary prophylaxis after myocardial infarction is practised haphazardly. It should be offered to all patients who can tolerate it, after a trial period to assess any side effects of the drugs if necessary. \nImpairment of mitochondrial transcription termination by a point mutation associated with the MELAS subgroup of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Defects in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with several different human diseases, including the mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. The mutations include deletions but also duplications and point mutations. Individuals with MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) carry a common A-to-G substitution in a highly conserved portion of the gene for transfer RNA(Leu(UUR)). Although the MELAS mutation may be comparable to the defect in the tRNA(Lys) gene associated with MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibres), it is also embedded in the middle of a tridecamer sequence necessary for the formation of the 3' ends of 16S ribosomal RNA in vitro. We found that the MELAS mutation results in severe impairment of 16S rRNA transcription termination, which correlates with a reduced affinity of the partially purified termination protein for the MELAS template. This suggests that the molecular defect in MELAS is the inability to produce the correct type and quantity of rRNA relative to other mitochondrial gene products. \nDifferential effects of thromboxane A2 synthase inhibition, singly or combined with thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism, on occlusive thrombosis elicited by endothelial cell injury or by deep vascular damage in canine coronary arteries. In open-chest dogs, cyclic flow reductions (CFRs, 5.1-6.6/hr in controls; n = 24) caused by platelet deposition/dislodgment at sites of endothelial cell injury in critically stenosed left anterior descending coronary arteries (59% flow reduction) were attenuated to the same extent either by single thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthase inhibition (0.31 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; CFR, 0.16 +/- 0.16/hr; n = 6; p less than 0.05) or by a comparatively modest degree of TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism on top of TXA2 synthase inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; CFR, 0.22 +/- 0.1/hr; n = 10; p less than 0.05). By contrast, occlusive thrombosis on deep vascular damage elicited by intraluminal stimulation (150-microA anodal constant current) in nonpreconstricted canine coronary arteries (time to occlusion, 237.1 +/- 13.9 minutes; n = 7; incidence of occlusion within 300 minutes, six of seven experiments) was not affected by platelet cyclooxygenase inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. acetylsalicylic acid; n = 7), single TXA2 synthase inhibition (1.25 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; n = 7), or single TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism (10 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/hr i.v. sulotroban for 300 minutes; n = 5). However, such an occlusive thrombus formation was significantly reduced by combined TXA2 synthase/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; time to occlusion greater than 300 minutes, n = 7; incidence of occlusion within 300 minutes, one of seven experiments; p less than 0.05). This study reveals 1) a differential efficacy of TXA2 synthase inhibition, singly or combined with TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism, depending on the extent of the vessel wall lesion triggering thrombosis and the size of the thrombus required to obstruct the vascular lumen and 2) a significant synergism in preventing occlusive thrombosis of extensively damaged coronary arteries between strong TXA2 synthase inhibition and comparatively modest TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism with ridogrel. \nDouble blind crossover comparison of the effects of dual chamber pacing (DDD) and ventricular rate adaptive (VVIR) pacing on neuroendocrine variables, exercise performance, and symptoms in complete heart block. OBJECTIVE--To compare the effects of dual chamber pacing (DDD) and ventricular rate adaptive pacing (activity sensing) (VVIR) in patients with complete heart block. DESIGN--Double blind crossover comparison with one month in each pacing mode. PATIENTS--10 consecutive patients aged 23-74 presenting with complete anterograde atrioventricular block at rest and on exercise and with an intact atrial rate response received Synergyst I (Medtronic) pacemakers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Symptom scores, maximal exercise performance on a treadmill, and the plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. RESULTS--No significant differences were identified between pacing modes in symptom scores for dyspnoea, fatigue, and mood disturbance; exercise time; and maximal oxygen consumption. One patient with intact ventriculoatrial conduction developed pacemaker syndrome during VVIR pacing. Resting plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide were raised in complete heart block and were restored to normal by DDD pacing but not by VVIR pacing. Resting plasma catecholamine concentrations were normal in complete heart block and in both pacing modes. During exercise the increase in the concentrations of all three hormones was similar in both pacing modes. CONCLUSIONS--In patients with complete anterograde and retrograde atrioventricular block, symptoms and maximal exercise performance were no better during DDD than during VVIR pacing. \nEpstein-Barr virus and persistent graft dysfunction after liver transplantation. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, depending on the immune status of the host. In this report, we describe two liver transplant patients who received hepatic allografts from donors serologically positive for Epstein-Barr virus and who experienced primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus associated with prolonged liver graft dysfunction. In both patients, Epstein-Barr serologies converted within 3 mo of liver transplantation, and hepatic histological study revealed mononuclear infiltration of the sinusoids evolving to pronounced immunoblastic features suggestive of evolving lymphoma. In both cases, in situ hybridization studies confirmed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus genome in the liver. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA were present in biopsy specimens obtained during the episode of acute hepatitis that followed Epstein-Barr virus seroconversion. The degree of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated by polymerase chain reaction appeared to increase in parallel with the progression of parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates. In one patient, a biopsy sample from a cervical node also revealed high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Furthermore, in these patients, Epstein-Barr virus DNA levels appeared to decrease dramatically after discontinuing azathioprine administration and beginning treatment with acyclovir. These two cases illustrate the dynamics of Epstein-Barr virus immune regulation and confirm chronic hepatic allograft dysfunction related to Epstein-Barr viral infection. \nPseudarthrosis of the scaphoid treated by the Matti-Russe operation. A long-term review of 77 cases. We report the long-term results of the Matti-Russe operation for pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid in 100 cases, reported previously by Mulder in 1968. Clinical results for 77 patients and radiographic data for 74 were reviewed at 22 to 34.8 years after surgery. In general, there was satisfactory relief of pain and stiffness but some patients had limitation of motion and reduced grip-strength, with usually slight osteoarthritic changes. There was poor correlation between subjective, objective, and radiographic results but 88% of the patients were satisfied with their results. \nHydroureteronephrosis secondary to perforated Meckel's diverticulum. Complications related to Meckel's diverticulum are not unusual. However, involvement of the urinary tract is extremely rare. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of ureteral obstruction due to perforation of Meckel's diverticulum. \nPathogenesis of respiratory infections due to influenza virus: implications for developing countries. The influenza viruses have an important and distinctive place among respiratory viruses: they change antigenic character at irregular intervals, infect individuals of all ages, cause illnesses characterized by constitutional symptoms and tracheobronchitis, produce yearly epidemics associated frequently with excess morbidity and mortality, and predispose the host to bacterial superinfections. Much is known about influenza viruses, but their role in respiratory infections among children in developing countries is poorly understood, and the risk factors that lead to the excess morbidity and mortality have not been identified clearly. Among the many risk factors that may be important are alterations in host immunity, malnutrition, prior or coincident infections with other microorganisms, inhaled pollutants, and lack of access to medical care. There is a great need for research that can establish more precisely the role these and other unidentified factors play in the pathogenesis of influenza infections in children in the developing world. \nExpression of atrial natriuretic factor in the human ventricle is independent of chamber dilation This study investigated the presence of atrial natriuretic factor in ventricular tissue obtained from humans with dilated or restrictive heart disease. In 17 patients with ventricular dilation and impaired systolic function and in 8 patients with restrictive heart disease and preserved systolic function, the presence of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor was investigated in tissue obtained by ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. The objective of the study was to determine if the ventricular presence of atrial natriuretic factor is dependent on ventricular dilation. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was greater in the group with dilated cardiomyopathy than in the group with restrictive cardiomyopathy (134 +/- 13 versus 78 +/- 5 ml/m2, p less than 0.05); end-diastolic pressure was elevated in the two groups (20 +/- 2 versus 25 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = NS). With the use of immunohistochemical techniques, ventricular atrial natriuretic factor was clearly detected in 15 of the 17 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in 6 of the 8 patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor in living patients with either systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Whereas in the atria, stretch or dilation may be an important stimulus, atrial natriuretic factor in the ventricular chamber occurs independent of dilation. \nKnowledge-based computer system to aid in the histopathological diagnosis of breast disease. A knowledge-based computer system, designed to assist pathologists in the histological diagnosis of breast disease, is described. This system represents knowledge in the form of \"disease profiles\" and uses a novel inference model based on the mathematical technique of hypergraphs. Its design overcomes many of the limitations of existing expert system technologies when applied to breast disease. In particular, the system can quickly focus on a differential problem and thus reduce the amount of data necessary to reach a conclusion. The system was tested on two sets of samples, consisting of 14 retrospective cases and five hypothetical cases of breast disease. Its recommendations were judged \"correct\" by the evaluating pathologist in 15 cases. This study shows the feasibility of providing \"decision support\" in histopathology. \nDiurnal variations of neurocardiac rhythms in acute myocardial infarction. To determine the diurnal pattern of cardiac autonomic tone in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), this study examined the power spectrum of heart rate (HR) variability in 24 patients during a single 24-hour segment within 4 days of AMI. Patients were nonrandomly allocated to a group (n = 14) without autonomic drugs and to a group (n = 10) already receiving beta blockers at the time of AMI. With use of autoregressive modeling, the power spectrum of HR variability was computed from continuous 1-hour electrocardiographic segments recorded at equally spaced intervals; 7 to 8 A.M., 3 to 4 P.M., and 11 to 12 P.M. All patients were supine, awake and pain free during recordings. There were no differences in HR, HR variance or the low-frequency peak power (0.06 to 0.1 Hz) from one temporal sequence to another. For the patients not taking beta blockers, the high-frequency peak power (0.2 to 0.36 Hz) or vagal component increased significantly from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. (28 +/- 11 to 45 +/- 20 beats/min2.Hz-1, p less than 0.01). There was a significant decrease in the low- to high-frequency peak power and area ratios from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. All power spectral parameters in the patients taking beta blockers remained unchanged over 24 hours. There was significantly heightened vagal modulation of sinus node activity in those receiving beta blockers, especially at 7 A.M. and 3 P.M. The data suggest that under steady-state wakeful conditions in the early recovery phase after an AMI, vagal tone is more pronounced during the late evening hours with a possible shift to relative sympathetic dominance during early morning and midafternoon hours. \nArgyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions and alpha-fetoprotein in adenomatous hyperplasia in human cirrhotic livers. Recently, adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) of the liver has been suspected as a precancerous lesion in human hepatocarcinogenesis. The authors examined 75 cases of AH from 42 cirrhotic livers, using staining of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs). These reflect proliferative cell activity. Findings in AH were compared with those seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other chronic liver diseases. Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also examined immunohistochemically. The authors classified AH into three types: ordinary (OAH), atypical (AAH), and AH with focal malignancy (FM). OAH implies a lack of atypia; AAH represents AH with structural and cellular atypia but without the features of overt carcinoma; and FM denotes AH with foci of overt HCC. Forty of the 75 cases of AH were categorized as OAH, 19 as AAH, and 16 as FM. The noncancerous areas of FM had features of AAH. The mean number of AgNORs in AH was intermediate between that seen in cirrhosis (2.93) and HCC (6.18) and showed a step-wise increase in the following order: OAH (2.95), AAH (3.89), noncancerous areas in FM (4.58), and malignant foci in FM (5.71). There was no significant difference in AgNOR counts between OAH and cirrhosis. AgNOR counts in AAH and FM were significantly higher than those of OAH, and lower than those of HCC. AFP was positive in 12 of 25 HCCs and in malignant foci of 3 FM lesions, but it was absent in OAH and AAH. These data suggest that OAH has a limited capacity for proliferation but that AAH and FM are much more replicative. The latter two conditions are probably preneoplastic lesions or early forms of HCC. \nExplicit memory and repetition priming in depression. Preliminary findings. Explicit memory and repetition priming, a form of implicit memory, were examined in depressed patients and controls. Explicit memory of depressed patients was severely impaired, whereas repetition priming was intact. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the impairment of memory in depression is linked to a failure of effort-demanding cognitive processes. Repetition priming might be useful in differentiating between depression and dementia. \nLupron retards proliferation of ovarian epithelial tumor cells cultured in serum-free medium. Some patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer respond favorably to treatment with GnRH agonists. This effect was proposed to be mediated by suppression of pituitary gonadotropin release. The present in vitro study investigated effects of human gonadotropin (Pergonal LH/FSH, 1:1) and Lupron, a GnRH agonist, on proliferation of an ovarian cancer cell line, 2774, which is estrogen receptor negative and grows well in serum-free, defined medium. Pergonal, 10 IU/mL or 30 IU/mL, did not enhance cell proliferation, which argues against stabilization of ovarian tumors in vivo due to decreased serum gonadotropin. Lupron, 1.4 micrograms/mL and 140 micrograms/mL, retarded cell division by day 6-8 of culture, in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric cell cycle phase DNA analysis demonstrated Lupron caused a reversible 5-6% increase in the portion of cells in rest phase, G0/G1, compared to controls during log growth, and a corresponding decrease in the portion of cells in DNA synthesis, S phase. However, long-term culture, 3 weeks, with Lupron failed to arrest cells in G0/G1, and experimental cultures plateaued at cell number similar to control cultures. We conclude Lupron's effect on ovarian cancer cell proliferation is independent of gonadotropin and steroid, involves a cell cycle regulatory event, and duration of benefit observed in vivo for some patients may be related to total tumor volume at the time of treatment. \nEarly-initiated zidovudine therapy prevents disease but not low levels of persistent retrovirus in mice. An F1 hybrid mouse strain containing the Rfv-3r/s genotype was inoculated with Friend virus complex (FV) and treated with zidovudine (ZDV) intraperitoneally three times daily for 20 days beginning as early as 10 min after initial viral exposure. This strain of mice develops FV-specific neutralizing antibodies that aid in reducing viremia and splenic virus titers but do not prevent splenomegaly and eventual FV-associated death. The virally exposed mice treated with ZDV did not develop splenomegaly or have detectable viremia after the last drug treatment. On day 21, a single animal had demonstrable virus in the spleen as determined by a focal immunoenzyme assay; 57% had detectable virus at 5 weeks, but non displayed splenic virus after 35 weeks. None of the animals died after the 35-week holding period, compared to 38% dying in placebo-treated mice. To detect low levels of the virus, or potentially latent virus, splenocytes were cocultivated with a cell line known to readily propagate FV, and the cells were subsequently passaged four times to amplify replication of the virus. After amplification, a significant increase was seen in the number of mice testing positive for virus. Thus, ZDV treatment initiated early after virus exposure was effective in preventing FV-induced splenomegaly and death, but did not prevent low levels of persistent retrovirus in the mice. \nMinute lesions of the rectum and sigmoid colon in patients with Crohn's disease. Sigmoidoscopy with a spray of 0.1% indigocarmine was performed on 20 patients with Crohn's disease whose main lesions were located proximal to the transverse colon and on 10 age-matched healthy volunteers. Minute lesions such as apthoid lesions, areas of erythema, and small ulcers were found in 90% of patients with Crohn's disease and in 0% of healthy volunteers (p less than 0.001). Among the minute lesions, aphthoid lesions were found in the highest incidence (85%). It was difficult to determine the presence of aphthoid lesions without the spray of indigocarmine, which facilitated detection. Histologically, granulomas were found in 15% of patients with Crohn's disease. Aphthoid lesions were not associated with superficial erosions and lymphoid follicles. The presence of aphthoid lesions in the rectum and sigmoid colon would be a strong indication of the presence of Crohn's disease. \nRegional changes in hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size in rats with aortocaval fistulas. 2. Long-term effects. Regional changes in hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size were examined in adult rats 5 months after creating a large aortocaval fistula. At that time, cardiac output, left and right ventricular pressures, and left and right ventricular dP/dtmax were measured. Subsequently, isolated cardiac myocytes were collected from the left ventricle, right ventricle, and septum for cell size measurements. Compared with sham-operated controls, percent dry weight was reduced in the liver and kidney but was unchanged in the lung. Heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular dP/dtmax, and systolic aortic pressure were not changed in rats with fistulas. However, cardiac output, stroke volume, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and all measured parameters in the right ventricle were significantly increased. Mean cell volume and the ratio of heart weight to body weight were both elevated 92%. Cell volume, cell length, and cross-sectional area increased significantly in each heart region examined. Hypertrophy was more pronounced in cells from the right ventricle and the endomyocardium of the left ventricle. The percentage of cells with mononucleation or binucleation was not changed in any heart region of rats with fistulas. In summary, despite evidence of renal and hepatic congestion, most indexes of cardiac function were normal or elevated 5 months after creation of a large volume-overload-induced hypertrophy. Data from isolated cardiac myocytes suggested that cellular hypertrophy, rather than hyperplasia, was responsible for the increased cardiac mass. \nSomatosensory function following dorsal root entry zone lesions in patients with neurogenic pain or spasticity. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning procedure, microsurgical DREZ-otomy (MDT), on spinal cord somatosensory function based on peri- and intraoperative clinical and electrophysiological data. The study was performed prospectively on a series of 20 patients suffering from either chronic neurogenic pain or spasticity. Physiological observations were made of the intraoperative evoked electrospinographic recordings as collected from the surface of the spinal cord. The MDT procedure produced analgesia or severe hypalgesia, moderate hypesthesia, and only slight deficits in proprioception and cutaneous spatial discrimination on the body segments operated on. These clinical data correlated well with evoked electrospinographic recordings, which showed a moderate effect of MDT on presynaptic compound action potentials recorded from the spinal cord (N11 and N21), a partial or even reversible effect on the cortical postcentral N20 wave, a more marked effect on the postsynaptic dorsal horn waves N13 and N24 related to large primary afferent fibers, and a disappearance of dorsal horn waves related to finer afferents (N2 and possibly N3). These data provide evidence for an acceptably selective action of MDT on spinal cord nociceptive mechanisms, and for a partial, often slight, involvement of the other somatosensory domains. The presence of abnormal evoked electrospinographic waves is discussed in relation to the mechanisms of neurogenic pain and spasticity. The hypothesis of a \"retuning\" of the dorsal horn as the mode of action of MDT is presented. \nControl of local blood flow in pulmonary inflammation: role for neutrophils, PAF, and thromboxane. The intrapulmonary instillation of C5a results in a local inflammatory response that, in this site, is accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow. Reversal of this decrease by vasodilators or the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor dazmegral has been shown to result in enhanced lung inflammation. In the present study the mechanisms underlying the decrease in flow in pulmonary inflammation were investigated in the rabbit in vivo and in the isolated blood-perfused rabbit lung. In vivo, the decrease in local blood flow was shown to be dependent on circulating neutrophils. In the isolated blood-perfused lung, inflammation induced by airway instillation of C5a was similar histologically to that seen in vivo and was also accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow. The decrease in blood flow appeared to require circulating neutrophils and was prevented by dazmegral and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists WEB 2086 and L-659,989. Furthermore, no decrease occurred in aspirin-treated lungs perfused with normal blood, suggesting that the source of thromboxane was lung rather than circulating cells. The decrease in blood flow in inflammation did not appear to be a consequence of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Inflammation in the guinea pig lung was also accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow and was also prevented by dazmegral and PAF antagonists. We conclude that local inflammation in the lung is accompanied by a decrease in blood flow that involves neutrophils and the lipid mediators PAF and thromboxane. We suggest that this form of negative feedback by the neutrophil serves to control the inflammatory response. \nRole of echocardiography in the diagnosis and evaluation of severity of mitral and tricuspid stenosis. The presence, severity, and hemodynamic consequences of mitral and tricuspid stenosis can be determined by echocardiographic techniques. In mitral stenosis two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging allows definition of leaflet anatomy and dynamics, subvalvular disease, ventricular function, and involvement of other valves. Spectral and color Doppler echocardiographic techniques permit accurate measurement of transvalvular gradient, determination of functional orifice area, evaluation of associated valvular regurgitation, and assessment of pulmonary artery pressures. These approaches are of recognized clinical value, and they provide additional diagnostic information that is unavailable from clinical assessment alone in a significant number of patients. Compared with available invasive diagnostic standards of reference, echocardiographic data have been found to be comparable in accuracy. In tricuspid stenosis echocardiographic imaging and Doppler techniques provide an assessment of valve morphology and function that should be similarly useful in clinical management decisions, although rigorous comparative studies have not been performed. Currently, carefully done echocardiographic studies are a definitive means of establishing the presence and significance of mitral stenosis and tricuspid stenosis, thereby obviating the need for invasive evaluation in many patients, reducing risk, and potentially decreasing the cost of diagnostic assessment. \nLack of diameter effect on short-term patency of size-matched Dacron aortobifemoral grafts. This study examined the relationship between graft diameter and subsequent patency in 79 patients who received Dacron aortobifemoral bypass grafts for aortoiliac occlusive disease between 1985 and 1989. Sixty-five percent of these patients were men, 25% were diabetic, and 94% were smokers, with an average age of 62 years. Patients were followed for a mean interval of 24 months. Life-table survival was 92% at 3 years. All surviving patients showed \"significant\" postoperative improvement by use of Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery combined clinical and vascular laboratory criteria. There were three early and five late graft thromboses. Primary and secondary life-table patencies were 85% and 92%, respectively, at 3 years. Dacron bifurcation grafts were selected to match the size of native arteries. Patients receiving small diameter grafts, defined as 12 mm (n = 9) and 14 mm (n = 39), were compared with patients receiving large diameter grafts of 16 mm (n = 26) and 18 mm (n = 5). Small diameter grafts were more likely to be used in women (p less than 0.01), but patient groups were otherwise comparable with respect to age, smoking history, diabetes, outflow status, operative indications, type of proximal anastomosis (end-to-end or end-to-side), location of distal anastomosis (common femoral vs deep femoral), type of graft construction (knitted vs woven), and functional result. Graft diameter did not influence life-table patency, which was 84% for small and 87% for large diameter grafts at 3 years (p = 0.74). Furthermore, none of the other variables listed above influenced graft patency. \nAmnesia following damage to the left fornix and to other sites. A comparative study. Two memory-impaired patients, who had suffered damage to the left or both fornix columns during removal of a ventricular cyst, were compared with 3 others having left-sided hippocampal or thalamic lesions, and with normal controls. The tests used were nonverbal--scene recognition, delayed matching-to-sample and concurrent pattern and object discrimination learning. The last two are differentially sensitive to fornix transection and to hippocampal or thalamic ablations in monkeys; however, the patients with fornix damage did not show a distinctive pattern of impairment. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The study adds to the evidence that fornix transection can cause wide-ranging memory disturbances in man. \nDNA ploidy analysis of effectiveness of radiation therapy for cervical carcinoma. Cellular DNA content from 30 patients with cervical carcinoma was determined using flow cytometry before and after radiation therapy (RT). The authors attempted to correlate changes in DNA content, tumor response to RT, and post-RT pathologic findings. Before RT, tumors from eight of 30 patients (26.7%) were diploid or near-diploid; tumors from 22 patients (73.3%) were aneuploid. After RT, diploid or near-diploid tumors were found in 23 patients (76.7%), and aneuploid tumors were observed in seven patients (23.3%). Aneuploidy disappeared in 15 of the patient tumors, and complete tumor response (CR) was observed in 13 of these 15 patients (86.7%). Pathologic examinations were negative in 12 of 15 cases and suspicious in one of 15 cases. Of the seven patients whose tumor aneuploidy did not change after RT, CR was observed in only two (28.7%). Pathologic examinations were positive in five of seven cases and suspicious in one of seven cases. The CR for the 22 patients with pre-RT aneuploid tumors was 15 of 22 (68.2%); the CR for the eight patients with pre-RT diploid tumors was two of eight (25%, P less than 0.01). From these data the authors conclude there is a direct correlation between DNA content and radiosensitivity in cervical carcinoma. Aneuploid tumors from these patients were more radiosensitive than diploid tumors, and they patients had a better clinical tumor response and improved pathologic findings. \nEnhanced GABAergic inhibition preserves hippocampal structure and function in a model of epilepsy. Extensive electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway input to the hippocampus results in a characteristic pattern of neuronal death, which is accompanied by an impairment of cognitive functions similar to that seen in human temporal lobe epilepsy. The excitotoxic hypothesis of epileptic cell death [Olney, J. W. (1978) in Kainic Acid as a Tool in Neurobiology, eds. McGeer, E., Olney, J. W. & McGeer, P. (Raven, New York), pp. 95-121; Olney, J. W. (1983) in Excitotoxins, eds. Fuxe, K., Roberts, P. J. & Schwartch, R. (Wenner-Gren International Symposium Series, Macmillan, London), Vol. 39, pp. 82-96; and Rothman, S. M. & Olney, J. W. (1986) Ann. Neurol. 19, 105-111] predicts an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, which occurs probably as a result of hyperactivity in afferent pathways or impaired inhibition. In the present study, we investigated whether the enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated (GABAergic) inhibition of neurotransmission by blocking the GABA-metabolizing enzyme, GABA transaminase, could influence the histopathological and/or the behavioral outcome in this epilepsy model. We demonstrate that the loss of pyramidal cells and hilar somatostatin-containing neurons can be abolished by enhancing the level of synaptically released GABA, and that the preservation of hippocampal structure is accompanied by a significant sparing of spatial memory as compared with placebo-treated controls. These results suggest that enhanced GABAergic inhibition can effectively block the pathophysiological processes that lead to excitotoxic cell death and, as a result, protect the brain from seizure-induced cognitive impairment. \nCortical blindness in children: a study of etiology and prognosis. Thirty-four children (20 boys, 14 girls) with congenital and acquired cortical blindness were analyzed for visual outcome in relation to etiology, visual evoked potentials, electroencephalography, and cranial computed tomography. All 7 children with congenital cortical blindness remained blind on subsequent examination. Of the 27 children with acquired blindness, 16 (59%) had poor visual outcome. Poor visual outcome occurred in those with cardiac arrest, hypoxia, status epilepticus, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, and head trauma. Good visual outcome occurred in children with hypotensive episodes after cardiac surgery. Of the 12 children with recovery of vision, the interval from acute loss of vision to partial or total recovery was 2 weeks to 5 months. Seven children had complete recovery of vision with no residual visual field defect. The majority of children (87%) had focal or multifocal spike-and-waves and slow sharp-wave discharges on electroencephalography. None had photic recruitment response or occipital spike-and-wave discharges. Flash visual evoked potential studies performed during acute episodes of cortical blindness documented 11 with absent response, 10 with bilateral increases in latency, and 6 with normal responses. There was no correlation between normal visual evoked potentials and a good visual outcome. Only 2 of 6 children with normal responses had normal vision. Abnormal or absent responses are more predictive of a poor recovery of vision because only 3 of 21 (14%) had normal vision on subsequent examination. Abnormal electroencephalographic findings with focal or multifocal spike-and-wave discharges or cerebral atrophy on cranial computed tomography are also poor prognostic signs. \nFactors affecting ability to resume oral nutrition in the oropharyngeal dysphagic individual. Successful oral intake of nutrition depends not only on the patient's ability to swallow efficiently and safely but also a number of cognitive, neurolinguistic, and behavioral variables. This paper reviews these competencies as they are integrated into the act of oral feeding and describes the types of disorders that affect these abilities. Methods of evaluating and treating the abilities needed for successful oral intake are described. \nRecurrent abortion and the diagnosis of Wilson disease. We describe the first patient with Wilson disease and recurrent abortion who was effectively treated with oral zinc for both conditions. Between the ages of 21-26, this patient experienced seven successive unexplained abortions. At age 27, neurologic signs and liver function disturbances appeared. Wilson disease was diagnosed when Kayser-Fleischer rings were detected in the cornea. Decoppering therapy was instituted with zinc sulfate per os. By the age of 31, hepatic and neurologic signs had vanished. The patient conceived, and after an uncomplicated eighth pregnancy she delivered her first healthy child. Two years later, a ninth pregnancy was equally successful. The chance that Wilson disease may be the cause of recurrent abortion is small. However, because the disease is fatal if left untreated and because it is an underdiagnosed disease, we recommend screening for Wilson disease in cases of unexplained recurrent abortion when family history demonstrates consanguinity or neurologic, psychiatric, and/or liver disorders. A strategy to this end is proposed. \nKi-67 immunostaining in node-negative stage I/II breast carcinoma. Significant correlation with prognosis. Prognostic predictors for node-negative breast carcinoma have not been clearly established. Immunostaining with Ki-67 antibody was performed on frozen sections of histologically proved node-negative breast carcinomas from 42 patients to examine its prognostic value and its association with other clinicopathologic and biochemical parameters, i.e., patient age and tumor size, histologic type, nuclear grade, mitotic rate, presence of vascular or lymphatic invasion, DNA ploidy, percentage of cells in S-phase, estrogen content, and c-erbB-2 amplification. Thirty-seven of the 42 tumors showed immunoreactivity with Ki-67 antibody in 1% to 55% of the tumor cells. A strongly significant correlation was observed between Ki-67 staining percentage and, respectively, nuclear grade, age, and mitotic rate. Nuclear grade 1 (the most anaplastic) tumors showed a significantly higher median percentage of cells stained (median, 14; range, 3 to 40) compared with nuclear grade 3 tumors (median, 0.5; range, 0 to 8). Thirteen patients developed recurrence; six of them died of disease. On univariate analysis, both 5-year disease-free and overall survivals were strongly associated with percentage of cells stained with Ki-67 antibody. Our results suggest that Ki-67 immunostaining correlates well with nuclear grade and clinical outcome in node-negative breast carcinoma. Because of small sample size analyzed in this study we were unable to do multivariate analysis. Therefore, further studies with larger number of cases are needed to determine whether tumor proliferative activity determined by Ki-67 immunostaining is an independent prognostic parameter or it merely reflects histopathologic features such as nuclear grade or mitotic activity. \nA forensic application of DNA typing. Paternity determination in a putrefied fetus. Using minisatellite DNA probes that hybridize to a variable number of tandemly repeated loci, an individual-specific DNA fingerprint can be determined. In the case reported here, we succeeded in extracting high-molecular-weight DNA from a 3-month-old fetus discovered during the autopsy of a murdered 28-year-old pregnant woman reported missing 10 days earlier. The results of analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms showed that all bands present in the fetus's pattern, but absent in the mother's, matched only those of the putative father. Thus, the paternity of the victim's husband was ruled out. \nChemotherapy dose intensity correlates strongly with response, median survival, and median progression-free survival in metastatic neuroblastoma We examined the efficacy of five commonly used drugs, teniposide (VM26), cisplatin (CDDP), cyclophosphamide (CPM), doxorubicin (DOXO), and vincristine (VCR) in a retrospective analysis of 44 clinical trials of induction chemotherapy for stage IV neuroblastoma patients newly diagnosed at older than 1 year of age. Dose intensity (DI) of each drug was calculated as milligrams per square meter per week. Linear regression analyses showed that the Dls of VM26 and CDDP had the greatest influence on clinical outcomes (ie, proportion of major response, median survival, and median progression-free survival [PFS]), while those of CPM and DOXO were less significant. VCR had no influence on the three clinical end points. Although many protocols extended treatment to more than 1 year, none of these end points correlated positively with the duration of therapy. Twenty-one weeks appeared adequate for achieving superior response, median survival, and median PFS. These results suggest that maximal dose intensification of selective drugs over a short duration may improve the outcome of patients with poor-risk neuroblastoma. \nMajor amputations done with palliative intent in the treatment of local bony complications associated with advanced cancer. Palliative amputations were performed on 11 patients (7 men, 4 women) with disseminated disease to control local bony complications. The average patient age was 54 years (range 14-78 years). The primary diseases were melanoma/sarcoma (seven patients) and carcinoma (four patients). All had pain; eight had intractable pain that could not be controlled by analgesics. All 11 patients had additional severe local complications, which included recurrent pathological fracture (4), sepsis (2), hemorrhage (2), radiation necrosis (2), and iliofemoral thrombosis secondary to tumor (1). Previous attempts of palliation had been made in all 11 patients, and 8 had undergone previous operative procedures (5 had undergone two or more) prior to amputation. Three anterior hemipelvectomies, five posterior hemipelvectomies, two hip disarticulations, and one forequarter amputation were performed. All patients survived the surgery, and there were no intraoperative complications. All patients received dramatic relief of pain. Postoperative complications included two cases of flap necrosis and two infections; all resolved satisfactorily. The six patients who were nonambulatory before surgery ambulated postoperatively, and two eventually ambulated with a prosthesis. Six of 11 patients survived 1 year or longer, with a median postoperative survival period of 13 months (average 16 months). Although major amputations are viewed at times as offering little to already-compromised patients, they can improve dramatically the quality of life in selected patients. \nConfirming the theoretical structure of the McGill Pain Questionnaire in acute clinical pain. Based upon a tripartite theoretical model of pain, the Pain Rating Index (PRI) of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) continues to be one of the most frequently used instruments to measure clinical pain. Although a number of exploratory factor analytic studies have failed to consistently support the theoretical structure of the instrument, one previous confirmatory factor analytic study of chronic pain did statistically support the a priori model. Because it has been suggested that acute pain may not involve the same dimensions as chronic pain, this study provided a direct test of the theoretical structure of the MPQ through multi-sample confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using data provided by women experiencing pain during labor (n = 185) and women experiencing acute postoperative pain (n = 192). Results of the LISREL CFA analysis indicated that the a priori, 3-factor, oblique model originally proposed by Melzack provided the most parsimonious representation of the data across the 2 samples of acute pain. \nThe physician's responsibilities: residua and sequelae. Cardiologists assuming responsibility for adults with congenital heart disease must have knowledge of electrophysiologic, valvular (native valves), prosthetic (valves, patches and conduits), ventricular (especially chamber function), vascular (especially elevated pulmonary vascular resistance) and noncardiovascular residua and sequelae. Acquired cardiac and noncardiac diseases coexist in older adults with postoperative congenital heart disease and add to the physician's responsibilities. \nThe mini-grommet and tympanosclerosis. One hundred and sixteen children with otitis media with effusion underwent myringotomy and insertion of a conventional pattern of Shah grommet in one ear and the much smaller Mini Shah grommet in the other. Close observation post-operatively determined the comparative rate of extrusion, recurrence of effusion, and of onset and degree of tympanosclerosis. At one year review, the Mini Shah shows a significantly earlier extrusion and a greater tendency to recurrence of otitis media with effusion. However, this is compensated by a decreased incidence of tympanosclerosis and reduced severity in those affected. This tends to support the view that shear forces produced by heavier patterns of ventilation tube promote tympanosclerosis. \nHemobilia due to vasculitis of the gall bladder in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease. A 30-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease presented with acute abdominal pain and signs of blood loss. At cholecystectomy she appeared to have lost a considerable amount of blood into the biliary tract due to bleeding of the gall bladder. Microscopic examination showed vasculitis of the gall bladder wall. Hemobilia has not been described before as a complication in mixed connective tissue disease. \nA world record marathon runner with silent ischemia without coronary atherosclerosis. A 62-year-old world record marathon runner was found to have silent ischemia manifested by a very abnormal stress test, whereas at autopsy nine months later, there was virtually no coronary atherosclerosis nor other disease of the coronary microvasculature. However, there was focal fibrosis of the papillary muscles consistent with remote ischemia secondary to possible CV. It is postulated that endurance-related high catecholamine levels might have been responsible. \nLack of ciprofloxacin ototoxicity after repeated ototopical application. The possible side effects of ototopically applied ciprofloxacin on inner ear function were investigated. The hearing function of pigmented guinea pigs was evaluated by daily frequency-specific evoked response audiometry after repeated application of the drug to both ears. Ciprofloxacin appeared to have no statistically significant effect on the hearing thresholds of the experimental animals. \nRisk factors for tunnel infections in continuous peritoneal dialysis. Little data are available about risk factors for peritoneal catheter subcutaneous tunnel infection. Therefore, we analyzed tunnel infections occurring in our program over a 10.5-year period. One hundred twenty-nine tunnel infections occurred in 92 of 411 patients (22%) on peritoneal dialysis for a mean of 19 +/- 19 months. Tunnel infection rate was 0.19 per year. By 1 year, 15% of patients had a tunnel infection, and by 2 years, 23%. Tunnel infection rates decreased with increasing time on peritoneal dialysis: 2.4 per year for patients on peritoneal dialysis less than 1 year, 0.8 per year for patients on dialysis 1 to 2 years, and 0.4 per year for patients on dialysis greater than 2 years (all different at P less than 0.01). Organisms were cultured in 109 tunnel infections: gram-positive cocci in 77 episodes (71%) [Staphylococcus aureus 57, 52%], and gram-negative bacilli in 24 episodes (22%). Tunnel infection rates were higher in diabetics than in nondiabetics (0.27 per year v 0.16 per year, respectively; P less than 0.001 by life-table analysis of time to first infection) and also higher in women than in men (0.23 per year v 0.17 per year, P less than 0.001). Tunnel infection rates were 0.35 per year for diabetic women, 0.20 per year for diabetic men, 0.18 per year for nondiabetic women, and 0.15 per year for nondiabetic men (groups different, P less than 0.001). Race and age were similar in patients with and without tunnel infections. Catheter loss was 80% when tunnel infection was associated with peritonitis and 40% when tunnel infection alone was present (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the risk of tunnel infection is highest early in the course of peritoneal dialysis and that diabetic women, for unclear reasons, are at the highest risk. \nAssessment of normal and abnormal erectile function: color Doppler flow sonography versus conventional techniques. The penile arteries were studied with color Doppler flow sonography in 10 subjects with normal and 39 patients with abnormal erectile function. The relationships of systolic and diastolic velocities to spectral waveform changes in the penile arteries in response to tumescence were studied before and after intracorporal injection of vasoactive medications that induce erection. In normal subjects, a characteristic spectral waveform pattern corresponded to increasing intracorporal pressure. Patients with abnormal arterial inflow and/or abnormal venous sinusoidal leakage demonstrated deviation from the patterns noted in normal subjects. Patients with abnormal arterial inflow had lower mean peak systolic velocities than normal subjects. Patients with severe venous sinusoidal incompetence had an arrest of waveform progression with evolution to but not beyond phases 1 or 2 (diastolic flow remained positive). Patients with abnormal arterial inflow and abnormal venous sinusoidal outflow had waveform changes that reflected both processes. Systolic/diastolic velocity and waveform relationships can be used to define the integrity of both the cavernosal artery inflow and venous sinusoidal outflow occlusion mechanisms. \nBreast cancer metastatic to the eye is a common entity. Breast cancer metastatic to the eye is a common entity occurring in up to 30% of women with metastatic disease. The prevalence of this lesion is not appreciated because of the dominant clinical picture of metastases occurring in other organs. The diagnosis should be suspected in any women with a history of breast cancer and any visual symptoms, particularly metamorphopsia and scotomata. A thorough ophthalmologic evaluation, aided by ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance scanning, usually confirms the diagnosis. Early treatment with radiation therapy can alleviate symptoms and control local disease. The recognition and treatment of this disorder is important in maximizing the quality of life in patients with metastatic breast cancer, especially because newer treatment regimens prolong survival and thereby increase the chances for ocular metastasis. \nIncidental detection of a microcystic adenoma of the pancreas. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are uncommon. The two major types of cystic pancreatic neoplasms are microcystic (serous) cystadenoma and mucinous cystic lesions (mucinous cystadenoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma). The two types differ substantially in the long-term mortality. Symptoms and signs do not distinguish between the two types, and small lesions are often asymptomatic. The neoplasms may be discovered during imaging procedures for unrelated complaints. Computerized tomography may suggest the diagnosis of microcystic adenoma or mucinous cystic neoplasm when the features are typical, but the final diagnosis must be established by surgical biopsy. Characteristic gross findings, light microscopic findings, and immunohistochemical staining patterns distinguish between the two types. When preliminary open biopsy confirms microcystic adenoma, extensive unnecessary surgery can be avoided. \nEffects of beta-adrenergic stimulation with dobutamine on isovolumic relaxation in the normal and failing human left ventricle. BACKGROUND. We tested the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated acceleration of left ventricular (LV) isovolumic relaxation (i.e., positive lusitropic response) is attenuated in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) compared with patients without LV dysfunction or CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS. The beta-adrenergic agonist dobutamine was infused by the intracoronary route in 14 subjects (normal group, six; CHF patients, eight) and by the intravenous route in a second group of 14 subjects (normal group, four; CHF patients, 10). The positive inotropic response to intracoronary or intravenous dobutamine was substantially and significantly reduced in the patients with CHF. LV isovolumic relaxation rate was determined by the methods of Weiss (TL), Mirsky (T1/2), and by a nonlinear regression technique (TNL). LV isovolumic relaxation assessed by all three methods was significantly prolonged in CHF patients compared with normal subjects. Intracoronary and intravenous infusions of dobutamine caused significant acceleration of LV isovolumic relaxation in both normal subjects and patients with CHF. The magnitude of the dobutamine-stimulated acceleration of isovolumic relaxation in patients with CHF was comparable with that in normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation causes significant acceleration of LV isovolumic relaxation in both normal subjects and patients with severe CHF. Coronary to our hypothesis, the lusitropic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation is well preserved in patients with severe CHF despite substantial attenuation of the beta-adrenergic positive inotropic response. These findings have potentially important implications regarding the physiology and pharmacology of adrenergically mediated LV relaxation in humans. \nDystrophin expression and somatic reversion in prednisone-treated and untreated Duchenne dystrophy. CIDD Study Group. The mechanism by which prednisone improves muscle strength and function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is unknown. We addressed the possibility that clinical improvement was related to prednisone-induced alterations in skeletal muscle dystrophin. We performed muscle biopsies on patients at the conclusion of a randomized, double-blind, 6-month trial of prednisone and analyzed dystrophin content using Western blots and antibody staining of tissue sections. These studies demonstrated no significant differences in dystrophin content between treatment (prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/d, n = 12; prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d, n = 9) and placebo (n = 12) groups. Of interest, however, was the presence of varying numbers of dystrophin-positive fibers (revertants) occurring individually or in clusters in antibody-stained tissue sections of more than one-half of the Duchenne patients. Mutation analysis revealed that revertants occurred in DMD patients with identifiable deletions half of the Duchenne patients. Mutation analysis revealed that revertants occurred in DMD patients with identifiable deletions or duplications, and in nondeletion patients. Prednisone treatment did not influence the prevalence of revertants. Revertants are most likely due to a second-site mutation occurring in a somatic cell allowing for restoration of the translational reading frame of the dystrophin transcript. \nDimethylformamide-induced liver damage among synthetic leather workers. Prevalence of liver injury associated with dimethylformamide (DMF) exposure was determined. Medical examinations, liver function tests, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations were performed on 183 of 204 (76%) employees of a synthetic leather factory. Air concentrations of solvents were measured with personal samplers and gas chromatography. The concentration of DMF in air to which each worker was exposed was categorized. High exposure concentrations of DMF (i.e., 25-60 ppm) were significantly associated with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (ALT greater than or equal to 35 IU/l), a result that did not change even after stratification by hepatitis B carrier status. Modeling by logistic regression demonstrated that exposure to high concentrations of DMF was associated with an elevated ALT (p = .01), whereas hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was slightly but independently associated with an elevated ALT (p = .07). In those workers who had normal ALT values, there occurred still significantly higher mean ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, especially among those who were not HBsAg carriers. A significant association existed between elevated CPK levels and exposure to DMF. However, an analysis of the CPK isoenzyme among 143 workers did not reveal any specific damage to muscles. This outbreak of liver injury among synthetic leather workers is ascribed to DMF. It is recommended that the occupational standard for DMF and its toxicity among HBsAg carriers be evaluated further. \nParathyroid hypertensive factor, a circulating factor in animal and human hypertension. A new circulating hypertensive factor (parathyroid hypertensive factor; PHF) was shown to exist in the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) but not in that of normotensive rats. PHF produced a delayed increase in blood pressure with a peak response at 45 min (bolus injection) or 60 to 90 min (continuous infusion). This increase in blood pressure was coupled with an in vitro increase in calcium uptake in rat tail artery with a similar time course. The involvement of calcium in the mechanism of action was supported by the inhibitory effect of calcium antagonists on the vascular action of PHF. Furthermore, PHF increased the intracellular free calcium concentration in cultured smooth muscle cells from rat tail artery. Parathyroidectomy and parathyroid transplant experiments indicated the parathyroid origin of PHF. A culture of parathyroid glands from SHR, but not from normotensive rats, produced in the medium a factor which has the same biological property and HPLC retention time as plasma PHF. A novel cell type was described in the parathyroid gland of SHR, but not normotensive rats, and the percent of these cells correlated significantly with plasma PHF level and blood pressure. In some hyperparathyroid patients, plasma PHF and hypertension were found, both of which disappeared after surgical removal of the parathyroid gland. In both animal models and human studies, PHF seems to be associated with low or normal plasma renin and salt-sensitive type of hypertension. \nHow well can radiographers triage x ray films in accident and emergency departments? [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Mar 23;302(6778):696] OBJECTIVE--To assess the ability of radiographers to identify abnormal radiographs of patients attending accident and emergency departments. DESIGN--Prospective study over six weeks. SETTING--Teaching hospital casualty x ray department. PATIENTS--3394 consecutive patients referred for radiography. INTERVENTIONS--Radiographs were assessed by radiographers who were offered a four point triage scheme: normal, abnormal, insignificantly abnormal, or further advice required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Comparison of radiographers' assessments with an assessment made independently by the reporting radiologists. RESULTS--Overall disagreement between the radiographers and radiologists was 9.4%. There were 7% false positives and 14% false negatives. Most errors occurred in assessing radiographs of the skull, facial bones, chest, abdomen, and soft tissues. CONCLUSION--Unselected radiographers can offer useful advice on radiographs to casualty officers, but their high rate of false positive diagnoses indicates that they cannot triage casualty radiographs sufficiently accurately to allow them to extend their current reporting role. \nEarly treatment of ischemic stroke with a calcium antagonist. We performed a feasibility and safety study (phase II) of nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, in 57 patients. The objectives of the study were to begin therapy as early as possible (less than or equal to 12 hours) after the onset of ischemic stroke and to administer as high a dose as possible. All patients received an intravenous infusion of nicardipine for 72 hours, starting with a dose of 3 mg/hr and increasing to a maximum dose of 7 mg/hr. Upward titration of the dose was limited by a 10% decrease in blood pressure or a 20 beats/min increase in pulse. Intravenous therapy was followed by 30 days of oral therapy. The mean +/- SD interval from onset of stroke to commencement of therapy was 9.1 +/- 5.4 hours. Adverse reactions consisted primarily of hypotension requiring discontinuation of therapy in four patients. Score on a graded neurologic examination increased from 41/100 at baseline to 64/100 at 3 months for the 41 patients completing follow-up. There was no correlation between the dose of nicardipine administered and outcome, but the 11 patients starting therapy less than or equal to 6 hours after onset did better than those starting therapy 6-12 hours after onset. Further study of very early therapy with nicardipine is justified. \nShould intravenous immunoglobulin G be first-line treatment for acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? Case report and review of the literature. Acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare and serious disease. Treatment with prednisone, anticoagulation, antiplatelet drugs, splenectomy, exchange transfusions, vincristine, and plasmapheresis may be effective in some patients, but the response to these therapies is inconsistent and all carry the potential for serious side effects. We, and others, have recently seen dramatic responses to intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) when other treatments have failed. Although IV IgG is expensive, its costs are low compared with those extended plasmapheresis regimens. Since the response to treatment can usually be evaluated within a few days and the side effects appear less than with other treatments, we believe a strong case can be made for the use of IV IgG as first-line therapy for acute TTP. Continued multicenter studies are necessary to finally solve the problem of competing and confusing treatment attempts and synergism of treatment in acute TTP. \nThe prognostic value of deoxyribonucl",
