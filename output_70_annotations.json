        "text": "inized to assess changes in portal hemodynamics following splenectomy. Two groups were classified: (1) a group of 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and (2) a group of 20 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH). Portal thrombosis was present in five (25.0%) of the 20 patients with IPH and in two (1.8%) of the 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. As seen on celiac arteriography, the mean (+/- SD) diameter of the trunk of the splenic artery and vein was 8.99 +/- 1.55 and 16.2 +/- 3.6 mm, respectively, in patients with IPH, while it was 7.94 +/- 1.28 and 14.2 +/- 3.1 mm, respectively, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Changes in portal venous pressure were 78.4 +/- 59.4 mm H2O in patients with IPH and 43.5 +/- 38.7 mm H2O in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. There were no significant differences in the maximum level of thrombocytes in patients with IPH or in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver. These events suggest that portal thrombosis can occur with a significantly higher incidence in patients with IPH than in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver after splenectomy, and a decrease in blood flow in the portal vein may be closely linked to the formation of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with IPH. Preoperative examination of portal hemodynamics must be thorough. \nThe value of Doppler echocardiography in the management of patients with valvular heart disease: analysis of one year of clinical practice. Management recommendations based on Doppler echocardiographic examination and cardiac catheterization were compared in a prospective study in 100 consecutive patients who were admitted for evaluation and treatment of suspected valvular heart disease during 1988. Management recommendations were provided independently after both Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization by different and blinded investigators. Criteria for severe (clinically significant) and moderate to mild (insignificant) valvular lesions and management recommendations were agreed on in advance. There was disagreement on the severity of aortic stenosis based on the aortic valve area and maximum instantaneous pressure gradient in 1 of 54 patients, which resulted in differing management recommendations. Mitral stenosis was severe (valve area less than or equal to 1 cm2) at Doppler echocardiography but not at cardiac catheterization in 5 of 14 patients. Because pulmonary artery pressure increase during exercise at cardiac catheterization also suggested severe obstruction, management recommendations were similar. There was a potentially significant disagreement on the severity of aortic regurgitation in 9 of 76 patients and of mitral regurgitation in 14 of 90 patients; however, this did not produce differing management recommendations because with most patients coexistent valvular lesions or an impaired ventricular function mainly determined the ultimate management decision. Although of good quality, Doppler echocardiographic examination was nonconclusive for clinical decision-making in 15% of the study population because of uncertainty about the severity of mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation or because of problems in assessing the degree of left ventricular dysfunction in patients with severe regurgitation. \nSexual asphyxia in siblings. We present an accidental autoerotic asphyxiation of a 24-year-old man. Further investigation revealed that 18 years earlier, his brother, then 13, had been found dead, hanging in the family bathroom. Although that death had been ruled a suicide, reevaluation of the death scene indicates that this was also an autoerotic asphyxiation. This is the first reported case of sexual asphyxia involving siblings. \nLarynx preservation with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy in advanced but resectable head and neck cancer. Forty patients with advanced, resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, oropharynx, or hypopharynx whose surgery would have required total laryngectomy (TL), were treated with one to three cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy before local therapy with the goal of larynx preservation. Clinical complete responses (CRs) or partial responses (PRs) to chemotherapy were seen in 26 of 40 patients (65%). Three patients with primary-site disease unresponsive to chemotherapy underwent resection of the primary lesion and neck dissection followed by radiation therapy (RT). Thirty-seven patients were referred after chemotherapy for RT +/- neck dissection. Thirty-one of 40 patient (78%) were rendered disease-free (no evidence of disease [NED]). With a median follow-up of 49 months (range, 31 to 76), the overall actuarial survival rate for the group was 58% at 2 years and 33% at 5 years. The failure-free survival rate was 42% and 33% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Seven patients refused recommended TL throughout their course. This may have adversely affected survival results. A greater proportion of patients who achieved a CR or PR to chemotherapy remained disease-free compared with those who achieved less than a PR (P less than .001). Sixteen patients relapsed, 10 with locoregional disease. Six patients underwent TL, either for initial induction failure or at relapse, for an actual larynx-preservation rate of 34 of 40 patients (85%). If the seven patients who refused TL are included, the anticipated preservation rate is 27 of 40 patients (68%). Larynx preservation with combined chemotherapy and radiation is feasible and effective in patients with advanced, resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCHN). This treatment approach requires a motivated patient, careful patient monitoring, and close interdisciplinary cooperation among oncologists. \nDevelopment of a novel 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 analog with potent ability to induce HL-60 cell differentiation without modulating calcium metabolism. We describe several novel analogs of the seco-steroid 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3[1,25(OH)2D3] and their effects on differentiation and proliferation of HL-60 human myeloid leukemic cells in vitro as well as their effects on calcium metabolism in vivo. The 1 alpha-25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-26,27F6-vitamin D3 is the most potent analog reported to date, having about 80-fold more activity than the reference 1,25(OH)2D3 for inhibition of proliferation and induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells. Also, this analog decreased RNA expression of MYC oncogene in HL-60 by 90% at 5 x 10(-10) mol/L. Intriguingly, intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization mediated in vivo by 1 alpha-25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-26,27F6-D3 was found to be markedly (15-fold) less than that of 1,25(OH)2D3. In addition, 1 alpha-25(OH)2D3 bound to 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors of both HL-60 and intestine more avidly than did 1 alpha-25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-26,27F6-D3. This novel analog may open up new therapeutic strategies for several hematopoietic, skin, and bone abnormalities and may provide a new tool to understand how vitamin D3 seco-steroids induce cellular differentiation. \nIdentification of the proximal neck of giant paraclinoidal aneurysms. Technical note. Introduction of a double-lumen Swan-Ganz balloon catheter into the parent artery facilitated precise identification of the proximal neck in two giant paraclinoidal aneurysms. Reduction of the flow rate as low as possible and positioning of the patient's head were the most important factors in this procedure. \nGlutethimide treatment of disabling action tremor in patients with multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Glutethimide has been used to control essential tremor. Its efficacy in the treatment of disabling cerebellar and rubral tremor was assessed in an open study of six patients with multiple sclerosis and two patients with traumatic brain injury. Functional and quantitative tremor severity was assessed before treatment and 7 to 14 days after a stable dose was achieved. Six of eight patients exhibited visible functional benefit from treatment with glutethimide; abstract testing results correlated well with functional status in most cases. Four patients chose to continue to receive medication. Controlled trials of glutethimide to compare its efficacy with that of other medications used in the treatment of action tremor are indicated. \nShort-course versus long-course antibiotic treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A randomized controlled study of 100 patients. In an attempt to determine the optimal duration of therapy of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, 100 patients with neutrocytic ascites and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were randomized to short-course vs. long-course treatment groups. Empiric therapy was initiated before the results of ascitic fluid culture were available. Of the 90 patients who met strict criteria for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or culture-negative neutrocytic ascites, 43 were randomized to a group receiving 5 days and 47 to a group receiving 10 days of single-agent cefotaxime, 2 g IV every 8 hours. Infection-related mortality (0% vs. 4.3%), hospitalization mortality (32.6% vs. 42.5%), bacteriologic cure (93.1% vs. 91.2%), and recurrence of ascitic fluid infection (11.6% vs. 12.8%) were not significantly different between the 5- and 10-day treatment groups, respectively. Recurrence rates were comparable to the values reported in the literature. The cost of antibiotic and antibiotic administration were significantly lower in the short-course group. Short-course treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is as efficacious as long-course therapy and significantly less expensive. \nAcid secretion and suppression. Hydrochloric acid is involved in the causation of peptic ulcer, but the exact role has not been defined. Suppression of acid secretion is associated with ulcer healing. The acid secreting cell is the parietal cell, which possesses a proton pump in the secretory membrane; morphologic changes accompany and facilitate the active secretion of hydrochloric acid. Stimulation of acid secretion occurs by three major pathways, which utilize acetylcholine, histamine, and gastrin. The predominant effects of histamine are mediated by adenylate cyclase, whereas those of gastrin and acetylcholine involve cytosolic calcium. There is a complicated arrangement of receptors and pathways that culminate in the activation of the proton pump. The parietal cell is influenced by neurocrine, hormonal, and paracrine mechanisms. Peptides join the more familiar neurotransmitters in affecting the parietal cell. Somatostatin is present in the gut and acts to decrease acid secretion. The hormone gastrin is released, in a feedback fashion, when the antrum is alkalinized. Most stimuli of acid secretion are blocked by H2-antagonists. Inhibitory hormones are released when acid arrives in the intestine. Inhibition of acid secretion can be achieved by influencing the parietal cell at the level of histamine, gastrin, and muscarinic receptors. The proton pump itself can be blocked by drugs that inhibit the final phase of acid secretion. \nPlatelet emboli in rat brain cross when the contralateral carotid artery is occluded. The pathogenesis of embolic events ipsilateral to an occluded carotid artery is uncertain. To examine this question we combined occlusion of the left common carotid artery with embolism from the right common carotid artery in rats. Following ligation of the left carotid artery in 20 experimental rats, we irradiated the right carotid artery with a laser (632 nm, 200 mW/cm2, 12-15 minutes) following the intravenous injection of 12.5 mg/kg of the photosensitizing agent Photofrin II. Controls had left carotid artery occlusion with (n = 13) or without (n = 6) Photofrin II. Fifteen of the 20 experimental rats survived to be perfused at 24 hours; cerebral infarcts were identified in 12 rats, with bilateral infarcts in 10. There were 112 infarcts (101 small [less than 2.5 mm] and 11 large [greater than 2.5 mm] on the right and 103 (93 small and 10 large) on the left. Emboli were seen in association with some infarcts and were evenly distributed in the two hemispheres (37 emboli on the right and 40 on the left, with the midline azygous artery occluded in four animals). Left carotid artery occlusion did not produce infarcts or emboli in the controls. We conclude that cerebral infarcts in the distribution of an occluded common carotid artery may be caused by emboli from the contralateral carotid artery in rats. \nTraditional first-line therapy. Overview of medical benefits and side effects. When diuretic-based stepped care was first advocated for the treatment of hypertension, there were fewer classes of antihypertensive medication than there are today. In 1984, the third Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) for the first time suggested an alternative initial treatment with a beta-blocker in selected hypertensive patients, and the fourth JNC report has recommended the alternatives of calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for step-one therapy as well. However, only the diuretic drugs and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in prospective, long-term, controlled trials. Moreover, 30 years' experience with diuretic agents and 20 years' experience with beta-blockers have defined the advantages, disadvantages, and potential side effects of these drugs more precisely than is possible for newer agents. The diuretic drugs and beta-blockers remain excellent choices in the management of hypertension. \nTiming of invasive procedures in therapy for primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Timing of invasive procedures during chest tube therapy in spontaneous pneumothorax is undefined. Evaluation of 115 patients with primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax treated with tube thoracostomy revealed nearly maximal healing rates after 48 hours without a relevant increase if drainage was maintained for up to 10 days. In secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, a significantly lower healing rate was observed after 48 hours compared with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (60% vs 82%). Therapeutic success was not predictable by single clinical variables available at admission (eg, age, gender, and smoking habits) nor by their combinations. Recurrence rates were 30% in both primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Hospital stay averaged 6 days in primary and 15 days in secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Considering their efficacy and the low incidence of complications, the early use of invasive procedures such as surgical pleurectomy, after 48 hours of persistent gas leaking, seems justified. Shorter in-patient care and lower recurrence rates may result. \nFocal high signal on MR scans of the midbrain caused by enlarged perivascular spaces: MR-pathologic correlation. Punctate and linear foci of abnormal signal were observed near the substantia nigra in the midbrains of 32 (20%) of 157 patients undergoing high-resolution MR imaging of the brainstem. The lesions were most easily seen on long TR/long TE images, where they were of high signal intensity. Their location was consistently in the lower mesencephalon near the junction of the substantia nigra and cerebral peduncle. Unilateral lesions were observed in 18 cases, while bilateral lesions were noted in 14. A review of anatomic specimens revealed the constant presence of penetrating branches of the collicular or accessory collicular arteries in this location. Enlarged perivascular spaces around these vessels were frequently seen in the specimens and probably account for punctate and linear foci observed on high-resolution MR images of the midbrain. \nDietary calcium supplementation as a treatment for mild hypertension. The blood pressure responses of 19 mildly hypertensive (diastolic blood pressure 90-104 mmHg) individuals to treatment with either 1200 mg of elemental calcium supplementation or placebo were assessed weekly in a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Both groups showed a decrease in blood pressure (calcium treated: 6 +/- 12 mmHg systolic, 7 +/- 7 mmHg diastolic; and placebo controlled: 9 +/- 14 mmHg systolic, 9 +/- 8 mmHg diastolic). Differences between the two groups were not significant (P greater than 0.1). There were no adverse effects to either treatment. This study does not support the hypothesis that dietary calcium supplementation is more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure in mildly hypertensive individuals. \nThe contributions of interpersonal conflict to chronic pain in the presence or absence of organic pathology. This study investigated the influences of social support and interpersonal conflict on chronic pain in patients with arthritis or with myofascial disorders. Measures of social support, conflict, and pain were drawn from subscales of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, the Family Environment Scale, and the Interpersonal Relationship Inventory. Patients with myofascial disorders reported significantly worse pain (sensory and affective), higher depression scores, more interpersonal conflict, and less support from others than patients with arthritis, but did not differ from them on personality traits. Also, the contributions of conflict to pain were found to depend on the nature of the chronic disorder and on the source of the conflict, i.e., significant other, family, or social network members. For patients with arthritis, less intense pain (sensory and affective) was associated with higher family conflict. Less intense sensory pain in arthritis was also associated with more punishing responses from the significant other to pain. For patients with myofascial disorders, more intense affective pain was associated with higher social network conflict. Social support did not significantly contribute to pain for either group. Thus, chronic painful disorders may differ on the influences that social relationships have on pain. The implications of these differences for treatment are discussed. \ncis-platinum ototoxicity in children. Cis-platinum is an ototoxic antineoplastic drug. Evaluation of auditory thresholds in 33 children receiving cis-platinum shows that a threshold shift at 6 and 8 kHz is first measurable after a cumulative dose of 201 to 300 mg/m2. A 35- to 40-dB high-frequency threshold shift is evident after a cumulative cis-platinum dose of 301 to 400 mg/m2. Increasing cumulative doses of cis-platinum are associated with a greater degree of hearing loss. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were used to find a criterion value that effectively identified threshold shifts that were due to cis-platinum ototoxicity. A 15-dB or greater shift in the 6- and 8-kHz threshold average identifies a high true-positive (50%) and low false-positive (0%) rate of cis-platinum-induced hearing loss. Using this criterion, cis-platinum ototoxicity affected 77% of children who received cis-platinum (median cumulative dose 360 mg/m2). \nUltrastructural localization of interferon-producing cells in the livers of patients with chronic hepatitis B. Cells expressing alpha- and gamma-interferon were localized in the liver tissue of patients with chronic hepatitis B by means of light and electron microscopy using monoclonal antibodies. Interferon-positive cells were regularly seen in the infiltrating mononuclear cells, and the number showed a good correlation with the degree of the necroinflammatory activity of the disease. In chronic persistent hepatitis and in normal livers, they were infrequent or virtually absent. alpha-Interferon was shown to be positive in lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and fibroblasts, Kupffer cells and, weakly, in the cytoplasm of a few hepatocytes in cases of active hepatitis, whereas gamma-interferon was demonstrated only in lymphocytes. The expression of human leukocyte class I antigens on hepatocytes showed a close association with the number of interferon-producing cells, but not with the presence of virus particles and HBcAg in liver cells, when studied using electron microscopy and double-labeling. Interferon seems to be an important regulator of the local immune response in the liver in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Its functions may play a role in inducing the human leukocyte class I antigen expression on hepatocytes, thus enhancing the elimination of virus-containing hepatocytes by major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic lymphocytes. \nFactors affecting perioperative pulmonary function in acute respiratory failure. To determine the magnitude, duration, and associated factors of perioperative changes in pulmonary function, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 145 patients who required preoperative mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure before undergoing 200 surgical procedures. Patients were grouped into five pulmonary diagnostic categories: (1) adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 49); (2) pneumonia (n = 20); (3) atelectasis (n = 65); (4) congestive heart failure (n = 11); and (5) acute ventilatory failure (n = 55). Sixty patients underwent intra-abdominal surgery, 135 patients required surgery on the periphery, and five patients had a thoracotomy. For all patients, PaO2/FIO2 declined significantly from 321 mm Hg (mean) preoperatively to 258 mm Hg intraoperatively, and shunt fraction (Qs/QT) increased from 0.16 to 0.23 without a significant change in PaCO2. The magnitude of the increase in Qs/QT did not differ among pulmonary diagnostic groups. Preoperatively, patients undergoing laparotomy had lower PaO2/FIO2 (278 vs 340) and higher Qs/QT (0.19 vs 0.14) than patients requiring surgery on the periphery. Intraoperatively, Qs/QT increased more during abdominal procedures than during peripheral procedures. Intraoperative hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 less than 80 mm Hg) occurred during 13 procedures. Hypoxemic patients had a mean increase in Qs/QT of 0.20 (0.25 preoperatively to 0.45 intraoperatively), and a significant increase in PaCO2 from 38 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg intraoperatively). In general, these patients had ARDS (n = 10), sepsis (n = 10), a laparotomy (n = 9), and intraoperative mechanical ventilation via the Ohio Anesthesia ventilator (n = 8), a commonly used operating room ventilator. Their preoperative peak airway pressure (54 cm H2O) and minute ventilation (20 L/min) requirements exceeded the capabilities of the Ohio Anesthesia ventilator and likely contributed to impaired gas exchange intraoperatively. Within the first several hours postoperatively, PaO2/FIO2 recovered to preoperative levels in all patients, even in those who had severe intraoperative hypoxemia develop and who underwent laparotomy. We conclude that most patients with acute respiratory failure receiving preoperative mechanical ventilation experienced mild-to-moderate deterioration in intraoperative pulmonary oxygen exchange that rapidly returned to preoperative levels after surgery. We recommend that necessary surgery not be postponed by concern that pulmonary function will be worsened by surgery and anesthesia. \nSpinal cord pial metastases: MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine. The purpose of this investigation was to describe gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced MR findings in metastatic disease to the pial lining of the spinal cord. Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinomas (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one). Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS. We conclude that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of pial spread of metastatic disease in patients with a known primary malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms. \nCough, exertional, and other miscellaneous headaches. We have discussed several miscellaneous headache disorders not associated with structural brain disease. The first group included those headaches provoked by \"exertional\" triggers in various forms. These include benign cough headache, BEH, and headache associated with sexual activity. The IHS diagnostic criteria were discussed. Benign exertional headache and cough headache were discussed together because of their substantial similarities. In general, BEH is characterized by severe, short-lived pain after coughing, sneezing, lifting a burden, sexual activity, or other similar brief effort. Structural disease of the brain or skull was the most important differential diagnosis for these disorders, with posterior fossa mass lesions being identified as the most common organic etiology. Magnetic resonance imaging with special attention to the posterior fossa and foramen magnum is the preferred method for evaluating these patients. Indomethacin is the treatment of choice. The headache associated with sexual activity is dull in the early phases of sexual excitement and becomes intense at orgasm. This headache is unpredictable in occurrence. Like BEH, the headache associated with sexual activity can be a manifestation of structural disease. Subarachnoid hemorrhage must be excluded, by CT scanning and CSF examination, in patients with the sexual headache. Benign headache associated with sexual activity has been successfully treated with indomethacin and beta-blockers. The second miscellaneous group of headache disorders includes those provoked by eating something cold or food additives, and by environmental stimuli. Idiopathic stabbing headache does not have a known trigger and appears frequently in migraineurs. Its occurrence may also herald the termination of an attack of cluster headache. Indomethacin treatment provides significant relief. Three headaches triggered by substances that are eaten were reviewed: ingestion of a cold stimulus, nitrate/nitrite-induced headache, and MSG-induced headache. For the most part, avoidance of these stimuli can prevent the associated headache. Lastly, we reviewed headache provoked by high altitude and hypoxia. The headache is part of the syndrome of AMS during its early or benign stage and the later malignant stage of HACE. The pain can be exacerbated by exercise. The best treatment is prevention via slow ascent and avoidance of respiratory depressants. Acetazolamide and dexamethasone have proved useful in preventing this syndrome. \nDifferentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia with tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid). BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia have a characteristic (15;17) translocation, with a breakpoint on chromosome 17 in the region of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha). Since this receptor has been shown to be involved with growth and differentiation of myeloid cells in vitro, and since recent clinical studies have reported that tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia we studied the effects of tretinoin on cellular maturation and molecular abnormalities in patients undergoing the induction of remission with this agent. RESULTS. Eleven patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated with tretinoin administered orally at a dose of 45 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day. Nine of the 11 patients entered complete remission. In two patients, complete remission was preceded by striking leukocytosis that then resolved despite continued drug treatment. Serial studies of cellular morphologic features, cell-surface immunophenotypic analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome 17 probe revealed that clinical response was associated with maturation of the leukemic clone. All patients who responded to treatment who were tested by Northern blot analysis had expression of aberrant RAR-alpha. As patients entered complete remission, the expression of the abnormal RAR-alpha message decreased markedly; however, it was still detectable in several patients after complete morphologic and cytogenetic remission had been achieved. CONCLUSIONS. Tretinoin is a safe and highly effective agent for inducing complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Clinical response to this agent is associated with leukemic-cell differentiation and is linked to the expression of an aberrant RAR-alpha nuclear receptor. Molecular detection of the aberrant receptor may serve as a useful marker for residual leukemia in patients with this disease. \nCanine myocardial creatine kinase isoenzymes after chronic coronary artery occlusion. BACKGROUND. Creatine kinase (CK) exists as three cytosolic isoenzymes, CK-MM, CK-MB, and CK-BB, and one mitochondrial isoenzyme. Animal and human observations suggest that the CK-MB content of myocardium is dynamic and may increase in response to ischemia, but the response of the myocardial CK system to chronic coronary artery occlusion is not well-defined. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured serial changes in myocardial total CK, percent CK-MB, and percent CK-BB before and 3 weeks after coronary artery occlusion in 17 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Tissue biopsies were obtained from the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery myocardium, the right coronary artery (RCA) myocardium, and the circumflex coronary artery myocardium at baseline and 3 weeks after LAD occlusion (n = 6), RCA occlusion (n = 5), and no coronary artery occlusion (n = 6). Tissue samples were assayed for total CK, percent CK-MB, and percent CK-BB. Samples were also examined by electron microscopy for evidence of ischemic myopathy. Total myocardial CK activity did not change over 3 weeks. Percent CK-MB increased significantly in the tissue supplied by the occluded artery (4.1-fold in dogs with LAD occlusion and 6.7-fold in dogs with RCA occlusion). Percent CK-BB did not change. Dogs with LAD occlusion had ultrastructural evidence of myopathic fibers interspersed with normal fibers in the LAD myocardium. Dogs with RCA occlusion had no ultrastructural evidence of myopathic fibers in the RCA myocardium. CONCLUSIONS. Chronic coronary artery occlusion causes a pronounced change in the canine myocardial CK system that is limited to the tissue supplied by the occluded coronary artery. These biochemical alterations do not correlate with any cellular ultrastructural changes. Myocardial CK-MB content is dynamic, varies geographically within the heart, and increases rapidly after coronary artery occlusion. \nSegmental neurofibromatosis. Two patients had localized multiple cutaneous neurofibromas; one had bilateral involvement of the scalp and the other had true segmental neurofibromatosis. Other signs of neurofibromatosis were absent. Segmental neurofibromatosis may not be related to the generalized types of neurofibromatosis but may be a cutaneous hamartoma. \nMandible reconstruction with vascularized bone grafts. A histologic evaluation. To our knowledge, a histologic evaluation of bone healing after mandible reconstruction with vascularized human bone grafts has not been previously reported. Serial sections through both the decalcified graft and the junction between mandible and graft were evaluated in four patients who required surgical removal of their reconstructed mandibles. A failed scapular bone graft that had been wrapped within a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap for salvage following pedicle thrombosis showed markedly resorbed but viable bone with a fibrous union to the native mandible. Viable vascularized grafts without evidence of ongoing resorption characterized an iliac osteocutaneous bone graft and two scapula osteocutaneous grafts that healed with continuity of healthy bone between graft and mandible. Observations from the evaluation of these specimens are made regarding bone circulation, bone union, and bone graft survival as they occur clinically. Implications regarding the techniques of bone plating and indications for use of vascularized bone in mandible reconstruction are discussed. \nConservative treatment and long term prophylactic thyroxine in the prevention of recurrence of multinodular goiter. It has not been universally agreed upon that there is an optimum treatment for multinodular goiter and that use of thyroxine postoperatively in preventing recurrence is effective. We have studied a group of 185 patients who underwent thyroid gland operations and who were observed for a mean period of 10.25 years. Of these, 171 patients received postoperative thyroxine in a dose of 100 micrograms per day and a small group (14 patients) received no medication. In the group receiving no thyroxine, there were six recurrences, and in the group that received postoperative prophylactic thyroxine, there were nine recurrences, which is statistically significant (p = 0.003 per cent). When recurrences did occur in the thyroxine treated group they were small and easily managed by increasing the dose of thyroxine. No patient who took thyroxine postoperatively continuously underwent a second thyroidectomy. We conclude that, in this series, our policy of resecting only macroscopically pathologic thyroid tissue and prescribing prophylactic postoperative thyroxine is successful in preventing recurrent nodular goiter. \nImmunohistochemical quantification of substance P in spinal dorsal horns of patients with multiple system atrophy. Using a computer-assisted image analyser, an immunohistochemical quantification method of substance P-like immunoreactivity (SPLI) in laminae I + II of spinal dorsal horn was established and applied to 13 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) with no disturbance of pain sensation, including olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy and striatonigral degeneration, and 13 neurologically normal controls. To investigate whether alteration of SPLI is related to an autonomic disorder, myelinated fibre counts of the fourth thoracic ventral roots were performed. Eleven of 13 MSA patients showed a significant decrease in small and large myelinated fibres, and were diagnosed with definite Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS), with the exception of two who had no apparent history of autonomic dysfunction. SPLIs in laminae I + II in 10 of these 11 patients, when adjusted for age, were significantly decreased at both levels of the fourth thoracic and third lumbar spinal segments. The results suggest the disorder of SP-containing synapses of primary afferent neurons and/or those of interneurons in SDS. \nScreening for renovascular hypertension. The most common curable cause of high blood pressure is renovascular hypertension. Although hypertension is common in the United States, only a minority, approximately 1%, of patients have a renovascular cause. Using clinical criteria, a subgroup of these patients can be selected in which the prevalence of renovascular hypertension will be approximately 15%. In these selected patients, it is appropriate to proceed to a radiographic screening modality to look for a significant renal artery stenosis. The choice of modality should reflect the strengths and expertise of each specific institution. Hypertensive urography is no longer recommended for screening. Excellent results have been reported with intravenous DSRA in institutions where a strong interest in this procedure exists. Furthermore, intravenous DSRA is easily coupled with the collection of renal vein samples for renin assay. Intravenous DSRA, however, has not maintained widespread use. Although the radionuclide renogram is no longer adequate as a radiographic screening tool, stimulation with an ACE inhibitor, such as captopril or enalaprilat, may produce excellent results. In many institutions, this is the most appropriate examination. Furthermore, it is relatively noninvasive. Merely detecting a significant renal artery stenosis does not, however, mean the patient has renovascular hypertension. Both hypertension and a renal artery stenosis may be present and not be causally related. Because renovascular hypertension is, at least initially, renin mediated, the demonstration of increased renin production by the ipsilateral kidney should confirm renovascular hypertension. Prospective application of these results to patients undergoing revascularization techniques, however, has been disappointing. This may be related to problems in patient preparation, sample collection, renin assay, or even the physiology of chronic hypertension, which is incompletely renin mediated. Thus, offering revascularization only to those patients with lateralizing renal vein renins is not appropriate. If radiographic screening is limited to those patient at greatest likelihood for a renovascular etiology, intra-arterial DSRA or conventional arteriography may be used. These techniques most reliably detect renal artery stenosis. Their main disadvantage lies in their relatively invasive nature, as an arterial puncture is required. The poor predictive value of selective RVRRs implies that revascularization may be attempted without awaiting those results. If percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty can be performed with a satisfactorily low complication rate, both the diagnostic and the interventional procedure may be undertaken at the same setting. It is expected that further refinements in these diagnostic procedures, particularly with the use of stimulating drugs such as ACE inhibitors, will lead to further improvement in the diagnostic results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nMalignant colorectal polyps: venous invasion and successful treatment by endoscopic polypectomy. We reviewed the pathology of 81 malignant colorectal polyps in 80 patients treated by endoscopic polypectomy and assessed the importance of carcinomatous invasion of veins in the stalk (submucosa). All the patients were followed up for at least five years. Venous invasion was present in 30 of the polyps (37%). The histological features of lymphatic invasion were considered too subjective to be of value. Most of the tumours were well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas, one was poorly differentiated, and one was a signet ring cell carcinoma. Seventy one patients were treated by polypectomy alone, and 58 of these were alive and well five years later, with no evidence of recurrence. Nine died of unrelated causes within five years, but four died of carcinomatosis: one with recurrent tumour, one with a possible metachronous caecal cancer, and in two patients there was late development of malignancy of uncertain nature. The remaining nine patients underwent surgical resection after initial endoscopic polypectomy because of incompleteness of excision, poor differentiation of the tumour, or a decision by the surgeon. Tumour was not present in the resection specimens apart from a single lymph node deposit in the patient with signet ring cell carcinoma. These nine patients were alive and well without evidence of recurrence five years later. The results reemphasise the necessity of good cooperation between endoscopist and pathologist, meticulous laboratory technique, strict histopathological criteria including examination of resection margins and degree of differentiation of the tumour, and regular endoscopic follow up. \nAcute promyelocytic leukemia in Crohn's disease. Case report and review of the literature. A 19-year-old man with a documented 2-year history of Crohn's disease abruptly developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. A diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia was established by bone marrow cytology. Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow aspirate revealed aberrations of no. 8 trisomy and translocation between no. 15 and no. 17 [46,XY,t(15q+,17q-)/47,XY,+8,t(15q+,17q-)]. Nine cases of Crohn's disease complicated by leukemia have been reported, including the present one; once again, a relationship between Crohn's disease and leukemia is suggested. \nEndocrine therapy for desmoid tumors. Two female patients with desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) showed tumor regression after endocrine therapy. In one patient, tumor response to tamoxifen has been maintained over several years of treatment. In the second patient, who had inoperable mesenteric fibromatosis, the tumor progressed on tamoxifen but regressed after treatment with Zoladex (goserelin acetate, ICI, Melbourne, Australia) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of the use of Zoladex in the treatment of desmoid tumors. This review of the literature reveals that the biology of this disease is related to the endogenous hormonal environment and that estrogen receptors have been documented in desmoid tumors. Thirty-five cases are identified where endocrine agents have been employed, with a response rate of 51%. Furthermore, tumors may respond to second-line hormonal therapy after failing to respond to initial endocrine treatment. Endocrine treatments have also been used in other disorders of fibroblastic origin. The authors recommend that endocrine treatment be employed in inoperable desmoid tumors or where there has been postsurgical recurrence. In addition, the role for endocrine therapy in other soft tissue neoplasms should be determined. \nRisk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage in a longitudinal population study. The known risk factors of atherosclerotic diseases may be involved in the development of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. We studied the morbidity and mortality due to subarachnoid hemorrhage among 42,862 men and women aged 20-69 years who had participated in a large health survey in Finland. During a mean follow-up of 12 years, 102 non-fatal and 85 fatal cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage were observed. The total incidence was 37 per 100,000 person-years. Smoking and hypertension were positively associated and body mass index was inversely associated with the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage. These associations were not confounded by age or each other. No statistically significant association with risk was detected for serum cholesterol level, hematocrit content, known heart disease, or diabetes. The risk was especially elevated among lean hypertensive subjects and lean smoking subjects. The age-adjusted relative risks of subarachnoid hemorrhage for lean, hypertensive smokers were 18.3 (95% confidence interval (CI), 7.8-42.7) among women and 6.7 (95% CI, 2.3-19.7) among men as compared to the risk among subjects without these risk factors. We conclude that modifiable risk factors are predictive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, for which reason subarachnoid hemorrhage may in part be preventable. Leanness combined with arterial hypertension and/or smoking, in particular, poses a substantially elevated risk. \nOn a possible protective effect of HLA-A11 against skin cancer and keratotic skin lesions in renal transplant recipients. Renal transplant recipients who have skin cancer potentially related to human papillomavirus were HLA typed with a special focus on HLA-A11, which in nonimmunosuppressed patients is negatively associated with the occurrence of virus-related carcinoma of the cervix. We found also a negative association between HLA-A11 and skin cancer; none of the 66 transplant recipients with skin cancer were positive for HLA-A11. As HLA-A11 seems to have a protective effect against skin cancer, we speculate that antigens induced by squamous cell carcinomas and possibly also by human papillomavirus may be efficiently presented through HLA-A11 to cytotoxic T cells. We also investigated a possible influence of other HLA alleles on the susceptibility of renal transplant recipients to skin cancer. The frequency of HLA-B27 was significantly higher in the transplant recipients with skin cancer, with a relative risk of 3.4 relative to healthy controls. No significant differences were found for other HLA class I or class II antigens. \nAcute promyelocytic leukemia in Crohn's disease. Case report and review of the literature. A 19-year-old man with a documented 2-year history of Crohn's disease abruptly developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. A diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia was established by bone marrow cytology. Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow aspirate revealed aberrations of no. 8 trisomy and translocation between no. 15 and no. 17 [46,XY,t(15q+,17q-)/47,XY,+8,t(15q+,17q-)]. Nine cases of Crohn's disease complicated by leukemia have been reported, including the present one; once again, a relationship between Crohn's disease and leukemia is suggested. \nGlucagon and clonidine testing in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of glucagon stimulation and clonidine suppression tests in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in 113 hypertensive patients, 39 with and 74 without the tumor. In the glucagon stimulation test, blood was sampled 2 minutes after intravenous injection of 0.28 mumol (1 mg) glucagon, and in the clonidine suppression test, blood was sampled 3 hours after administration of oral clonidine, 1.30 mumol (0.3 mg)/70 kg body wt. Baseline levels of catechols in antecubital venous blood were abnormal, with norepinephrine greater than 7.10 nmol/l (1,200 pg/m), epinephrine greater than 1.51 nmol/l (276 pg/ml), norepinephrine/dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) ratio greater than 1.09, or dopa greater than 35.53 nmol/l (7,000 pg/ml), in 30 of 39 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 77%) and 1 of 74 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 99%). Results of the glucagon test were abnormal (norepinephrine greater than 11.83 nmol/l [2,000 pg/ml] or more than threefold increase from baseline) in 25 of 31 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 81%) and 0 of 72 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 100%). Results of the clonidine test were abnormal (after clonidine norepinephrine greater than 2.96 nmol/l [500 pg/ml] or less than 50% decrease from baseline) in 29 of 30 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 97%) and in 7 of 30 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 67%). Very high baseline levels of catechols therefore indicated the presence of pheochromocytoma, but there were several false-negative results when normal levels were obtained. The glucagon test alone was highly specific but not sensitive, and the clonidine test was highly sensitive but less specific. \nThe relationship between locomotor disability, autonomic dysfunction, and the integrity of the striatal dopaminergic system in patients with multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and Parkinson's disease, studied with PET. 18F-dopa and S-11C-nomifensine (NMF) are positron emitting tracers whose caudate and putamen uptake reflects striatal dopamine storage capacity and the integrity of dopamine reuptake sites, respectively. Using these two tracers, the integrity of the presynaptic striatal dopaminergic system has been studied with positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 subjects with multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome) who had an akinetic-rigid syndrome that was poorly responsive to L-dopa, autonomic failure, and cerebellar ataxia. PET findings for the 10 MSA patients were compared with those for 13 age-matched controls, 8 subjects with L-dopa responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), and 7 subjects with pure autonomic failure (PAF). Influx constants, Ki, reflecting specific 18F-dopa uptake into striatal tissue, were severely reduced in the putamen and caudate of the 10 MSA subjects (mean putamen Ki 0.005 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls; mean caudate Ki 0.007 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls). Reduction of putamen, but not caudate, 18F-dopa uptake correlated with severity and duration of locomotor disability. Eight patients with PD, and a similar degree and duration of locomotor disability to the patients with MSA, demonstrated equal impairment of mean putamen 18F-dopa uptake, but significant preservation of mean caudate function. The 7 PAF patients had normal mean levels of putamen and caudate 18F-dopa uptake, although 1 individual PAF patient had significantly impaired striatal function. The MSA and PD groups of subjects both showed significantly reduced levels of specific striatal S-11C-NMF binding, again caudate function being relatively preserved in PD. It is concluded that in both MSA and PD there is a parallel decline of striatal dopamine storage capacity and reuptake site integrity, probably reflecting a loss of nigrostriatal nerve terminals. Caudate function is relatively preserved in PD compared with MSA. The majority of PAF patients have an intact nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, suggesting that PAF is a condition distinct from PD and MSA in spite of some pathological similarities. PET is capable of detecting subclinical nigrostriatal involvement in PAF patients when this is present. \nFactors affecting decisions made by family members of patients with severe head injury. An exploratory descriptive study was conducted to determine factors affecting decisions made by families of patients with severe head injury during the first two stages of recovery. Nineteen family members of 11 patients participated in this study. Five interviews of each family member were conducted over a 1-month period after the injury. Sixty decisions were identified by family members. Six factors: personal functioning, relationships, information, uncertain outcomes, environment, and emotions, were found to affect these decisions. The six factors identified by family members have specific implications for nursing. \nBirth interval among breast-feeding women not using contraceptives. One hundred twelve Orthodox Jewish mothers were surveyed by means of questionnaire about birth interval in relationship to formula-feeding (n = 30) and breast-feeding (n = 236) experiences in the absence of birth control. Analyses indicate that mothers who breast-fed have longer birth intervals than those who did not. Moreover, data obtained from the same mothers show that birth intervals preceded by breast-feeding were longer than those preceded by formula-feeding of the previous infant. For those mothers who breast-fed, there was significant positive correlation between duration of breast-feeding and the length of lactational amenorrhea and total birth interval. The age at which night feeding was terminated had corresponding but less strong associations with lactational amenorrhea and total birth interval. \nStatistical modeling of prognostic indices for evaluation of critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To identify the most predictive association of variables from the usual indices of severity of illness by statistical objective analysis. DESIGN: Logistic regression analysis of the different variables of the most important indices. SETTING: A general critical care medicine group practice in a university hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 630 critical care patients age 12 to 87 yrs were evaluated. The most important indices of severity of illness and the corresponding variables were recorded and the patient's course was followed for 3 months after ICU admission. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One of our hypotheses was that the inclusion of an excessive number of variables to obtain the most common prognostic indices of mortality in critical care patients results in an underestimation of mortality and a redundancy of prognostic information. We performed a logistic regression analysis using the variables of the currently used indices of critical care prognosis: Acute Physiology Score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score, Acute Physiology Score-II, and Mortality Prediction Model. This mathematical approach resulted in a model of five variables: organ system failure, blood glucose, serum calcium, serum prothrombin activity, and serum osmolality. The score obtained from this model gave accurate prognostic criteria:sensitivity 91.2% and specificity 90%, using a cutoff point of 0.7; sensitivity 86% and, specificity 94%, using a cutoff point of 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that suitable statistical management of the discriminant prognostic variables allows reduction of the number of variables of the severity indices currently used, obtaining five more predictive variables. \nEnhancement of tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 antigen expression in hormone-related ovarian serous borderline tumors. The immunoreactivity of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) B72.3 with ovarian serous tumors of borderline malignancy from 44 women who were pregnant, were on hormone medication containing a progestin, or were known to be in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, was compared with that of similar tumors of 32 patients who were not known to be in any of these three categories. All 76 borderline tumors expressed the tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72) recognized by MoAb B72.3. Striking staining differences (P less than 0.0001) were observed between the hormone-related and the nonhormone-related tumors. Differences were also noticed between the staining of tumors from pregnant patients and that of previous, persistent, or recurrent tumors of the ipsilateral or contralateral ovaries when the same patients were not pregnant. Tumor MoAb B72.3 reactivity increased with progressive gestational age and fell to lower levels at term and during the postpartum period. Although it has been suggested by cell culture studies, enhanced TAG-72 expression in human tumors under hormonal stimulation has not been described before. \nPilonidal disease: 25 cases treated by the Dufourmentel technique. Twenty-five patients with pilonidal disease were treated by the Dufourmentel technique between 1984 and 1989. In this series, 18 patients (72 percent) were women and 7 (28 percent) were men (mean age, 24 years); hospital stay averaged 4 days. There were no recurrences and no reports of surgical wound infection. Diagnosis was confirmed histologically in all cases. \nBleeding complications following initiation of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction: a comparison of helicopter-transported and nontransported patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of helicopter transport of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after initiation of thrombolysis on bleeding complications through hospital discharge. DESIGN: Prospectively identified incidence (cohort) study. SETTING: Air medical service of tertiary-care teaching hospital. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-five consecutive AMI patients transported within 12 hours of the initiation of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator were compared with 119 nontransported AMI patients treated in a similar manner. RESULTS: The transported and nontransported populations were similar with regard to age, sex, and infarct location. Transport was well tolerated with no episodes of cardiac arrest or cardioversion occurring during transport. Hypotension requiring fluids or increased pressors occurred in 18 patients. Bleeding complications of all types occurred in 43.2% of the transported and 49.6% of the nontransported patients, respectively (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.17). CONCLUSION: Helicopter transport of AMI patients after initiation of thrombolysis appears to be safe acutely and without a clinically significant increase in risk of bleeding complications through hospital discharge when accomplished by a highly skilled team. \nOral melanoma and other pigmented lesions of the oral cavity. This article presents a review of oral malignant melanoma and other oral cavity pigmented lesions. The dismal prognosis for patients with oral malignant melanoma is partly due to patients' delayed recognition of signs of early disease and delayed diagnosis by physicians. Pigmented macules and plaques in the oral cavity, representing the radial growth phase of tumors, often go unrecognized for months or years before tumor invasion. Therefore, if early detection of thin oral melanomas is to be achieved, all pigmented oral cavity lesions should be viewed with suspicion. Biopsies of such lesions are indicated when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain. Prompt aggressive surgical treatment is essential in reducing the morbidity and mortality from oral melanomas. The differential diagnosis of oral melanomas includes nevi, oral melanotic macules, amalgam tattoos, Kaposi's sarcoma, oral melanoacanthoma, and physiologic pigmentation. \nSocial density, stressors, and depression: gender differences among the black elderly. This research examined gender differences with regard to the effects of social density and stressors upon depressive symptomatology among 600 Black elderly community residents (aged 55-85 years) of Nashville, Tennessee. The sample had more females than males and fewer married individuals. Approximately half of the males and females lived alone. Regression analyses show that poor ego and chronic medical problems were the common predictors of depression among both the males and females. Gender differences were found with regard to life events in that females tended to become more depressed as the number of events increased and as level of contact with relatives and friends decreased. Further, females with lower levels of social attachment, guidance, and reliability were more depressed. None of these social support dimensions related to depression among the males. These relationships tended to be stronger for those living alone than for those living with others. \nMaintenance treatment of duodenal ulceration: ranitidine 300 mg at night is better than 150 mg in cigarette smokers. Two hundred patients received either ranitidine 150 mg or 300 mg at night for 18 months to prevent duodenal ulcer relapse. Recurrence rates were lower in patients receiving the higher dose of ranitidine (3.1% v 9.7%, p = 0.78; 6.5% v 16.7%, p = 0.037; and 8.9% v 17.0%, p = 0.121 at six, 12, and 18 months respectively). In patients receiving ranitidine 150 mg, recurrences were significantly more common in smokers than non-smokers after 12 and 18 months, while in patients receiving ranitidine 300 mg recurrence rates were similar in smokers and non-smokers. Ranitidine 300 mg at night abolishes the adverse effect of smoking observed during maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 mg at night and may therefore be an appropriate maintenance dose for smokers who relapse during standard dose maintenance treatment. \nImpact of dosage schedule on the efficacy of gentamicin, tobramycin, or amikacin in an experimental model of Serratia marcescens endocarditis: in vitro-in vivo correlation. Aminoglycosides are usually considered to be concentration-dependent antibiotics and to have similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. To verify the equivalent activity of the aminoglycosides on a susceptible strain, we tested the killing rate of three aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin) on one strain of Serratia marcescens both in vitro and in vivo by using a rabbit model of left-ventricle endocarditis. Despite, similar MICs, the time-kill curve of gentamicin was consistently better than those of amikacin and tobramycin, whatever the concentration of each antibiotic used (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg/liter), after a 5-h incubation. The in vivo bacterial reduction in the vegetations was measured 24 h after administration of an intravenous 48-mg/kg bolus of each antibiotic or at the end of a 24-h continuous intravenous infusion of the same dose. Gentamicin was significantly more effective when administered as a bolus than when administered as a continuous infusion (2.8 +/- 0.2 versus 6.4 +/- 1.5 log10 CFU/g of vegetation, respectively; P less than 0.01), whereas amikacin was more effective as a continuous infusion than as a bolus injection (3.6 +/- 2.0 versus 7.5 +/- 1.3 log10 CFU/g of vegetation, respectively; P less than 0.01). Tobramycin was not very effective, whatever the dosage tested (approximately 6.5 to 7 log10 CFU/g). These results suggest that concentration-dependent bactericidal activities, both in vitro and in vivo, may vary greatly among aminoglycosides despite similar MICs. \nMorbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in family members of patients with malignant and nonmalignant hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver diseases. Three-hundred forty-one HBsAg-positive family members of 152 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (47 asymptomatic carriers, 59 with chronic hepatitis, 17 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were prospectively studied to determine the morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the family members of patients with malignant and nonmalignant hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver diseases. Most of the family members had no history of acute hepatitis, were asymptomatic and were unaware of their carrier status. However, 5.3% had stigmata of chronic liver disease, 6% had serum ALT levels that exceeded two times the upper limit of normal and 78% of those who had biopsies had chronic hepatitis with or without cirrhosis. During a follow-up period of 12 to 90 mo (median = 39 mo), 3% had symptoms of chronic liver disease; 24% had transient, recurrent or persistent elevation in serum ALT levels, 1.4% had cirrhosis and 1% had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither hepatocellular carcinoma in the index patient nor a previous history of hepatocellular carcinoma in the family was associated with an increase in the morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the HBsAg-positive family members. \nTransthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis and surgical management of right atrial myxoma. An asymptomatic patient was discovered to have a large right atrial myxoma by transthoracic echocardiography. Preoperative considerations included the possibility of satellite lesions, left atrial origin, and a question of tricuspid valve involvement. Subsequent operative transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated single-stalk attachment in the right atrial septal wall and no satellite lesions. Doppler and color flow examination immediately following tumor removal aided in the decision not to perform tricuspid annuloplasty as there was no significant tricuspid regurgitation. The combined use of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography with Doppler and color flow imaging aids in the preoperative and intraoperative diagnosis and surgical management of right atrial tumors. \nAge differences in depressive symptom experiences. Age differences in depressive symptom experiences were investigated in a community sample of 368 women between the ages of 51 and 92 who were administered the SCL-90 Depression and Additional Symptoms Scales. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess and compare depressive symptom experiences in a younger (age 51-65) and older (age 66-92) age cohort. Findings show that two somewhat different depressive syndromes underlie symptom reporting patterns, one having higher levels in the older age cohort, the other having higher levels in the younger age cohort. In addition, three more delimited forms of distress -- feelings of enervation, dysphoria, and sleep disturbances -- show higher levels among the older cohort. Implications of these findings for future research on the relation between aging and depression are discussed. \nExperimental treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion. The role of laser energy in the treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion was evaluated in two sets of experiments. First, 10 polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were used to replace segments of the superficial femoral arteries in dogs and were thrombosed by distal ligation. Occlusion was maintained for one hour, or for 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in each of two grafts. Patency was restored in all 10 grafts without perforation or anastomotic disruption using a 2 mm hot tip probe powered by an Argon laser. However, increased organization of thrombus related to the duration of occlusion lead to decreased laser channel diameters, and 75% of the 28 day thrombus remained in the graft after recanalization. The second experiments tested the added benefit of thrombolytic infusion following laser recanalization. Bilateral external iliac artery thrombosis was induced in dogs by operative vessel isolation, de-endothelialization, and thrombin injection. At 7 days the efficacy of laser-assisted thrombolysis (LAT) versus enzymatic thrombolysis (ET) alone was compared. Eight vessels underwent ET by urokinase (4000 I.U./min.); 14 vessels were laser recanalized prior to thrombolytic infusion. LAT was performed from a carotid artery approach in 8 vessels (antegrade) and from a femoral artery in 6 vessels (retrograde). In contrast to studies using the hot tip alone, both ET and LAT accomplished complete thrombus removal. However, LAT lead to significant iliac arterial flow in 9 +/- 8 min. (antegrade) and 25 +/- 8 min. (retrograde) while ET required 109 +/- 47 min (p less than 0.01). \nUsing anticoagulants safely. Guidelines for therapeutic and prophylactic regimens [published erratum appears in Postgrad Med 1991 Sep 1;90(3):48] Heparin and warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) are used most often to treat acute and recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, arterial disease, valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation. These agents along with dextran, pneumatic compression devices, and gradient stockings are also used to prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients at high risk (eg, those with venous stasis, lower limb or spinal cord trauma, clotting abnormalities). Anticoagulation therapy is monitored by maintaining the activated partial thromboplastin time and the prothrombin time in the therapeutic range. \nTrends in preterm survival and incidence of cerebral haemorrhage 1980-9. The annual survival rates and incidence of cerebral haemorrhage in 2618 preterm infants of 34 weeks' gestation or less were examined in one referral centre over a 10 year period from January 1980 to December 1989. Survival was independently related to weight, gestation, sex, and inborn delivery. When these variables had been taken into account, survival was 56% greater at the end of the decade compared with 1980. The incidence of cerebral haemorrhage (diagnosed by cranial ultrasound scanning) was related to birth weight, gestation, sex, inborn delivery, and caesarean section, but there was no significant trend in the incidence with time. Rates of caesarean section in this group increased from 31% in 1980 to over 50% more recently. Haemorrhage affecting the brain parenchyma was related to gestation and inborn delivery, and showed a small but significant decline over time. The lack of association between changes in survival rates and rates of cerebral haemorrhage may indicate that factors associated with both neonatal mortality and the incidence of cerebral haemorrhage may not be causally related as previously assumed. \nEndoscopy as an adjuvant to biliary radiologic intervention. Twenty-two patients underwent 24 percutaneous biliary procedures guided with choledochoscopy, an adjunctive percutaneous biliary technique. All but four procedures were performed through established percutaneous tracts; the others, through tracts less than 4 weeks old. The procedures were done for the following reasons: removal of calculi (n = 15), electrohydraulic lithotripsy (n = 1), biliary duct biopsies (n = 8), cauterization of a bleeding tract (n = 1), and evaluation of biliary-enteric anastomoses (n = 11). The only complication was one case of severe nausea after choledochoscopy. This patient required overnight hospitalization and medical treatment. All procedures were technically successful, except one case in which the tract was undersized. All patients received intravenously administered antibiotics before and after the procedure. It is concluded that choledochoscopy is a safe, atraumatic, and well-tolerated method of evaluating and treating biliary disease and that it markedly reduces radiation exposure. It can be performed rapidly with minimal sedation on an in- or outpatient basis. \nBlood transfusion and laryngeal cancer. Evidence exists to suggest a detrimental effect of blood transfusion on survival after resection for malignant disease. Immune suppression due to transfusion has been implicated, though this remains unproven. We have conducted a retrospective study of 69 patients (38 transfused, 31 not transfused) with squamous carcinoma of the larynx to assess the effect of blood transfusion on survival after laryngectomy. Patients were compared for age, sex, smoking habit, tumour site and stage, grade of operating surgeon, preoperative haemoglobin, tumour nucleolar organizer region status, and operation time. The minimum follow-up was 5 years. In the transfused group 21/38 died as a result of their malignant disease and only 4/31 in the untransfused group. This difference was highly significant (P less than 0.001, chi-squared test) and using a multivariate analysis the only variable associated with a decreased survival time was whether a blood transfusion had been received. We conclude that peri-operative blood transfusion is associated with decreased survival after laryngectomy. However, whether this association is causal remains unproven. \nL-tryptophan supplementation does not affect postoperative pain intensity or consumption of analgesics. Aiming at optimizing serotonin levels in endogenous pain-modulating systems, L-tryptophan supplementation pre- and postoperatively (2 g/day for 7 days) did not affect pain development or analgesic consumption after third molar surgery. Biological effects related to an increase in mood were observed, however, indicating transport of L-tryptophan to the central nervous system. The findings are discussed in relation to earlier reports on favorable effects of L-tryptophan on experimental pain in healthy subjects and in chronic pain patients. \nA chemical score to evaluate the protein quality of commercial parenteral and enteral formulas: emphasis on formulas for patients with liver failure. Essential amino acids, found in abundance in high-quality dietary protein, are required daily by hospitalized patients and healthy persons to maintain the dynamic process of protein metabolism. One method for assessing dietary protein quality is by determining a diet's chemical score, ie, the ratio of a gram of the limiting amino acid in a test diet to the same amount of the corresponding amino acid in a reference diet (eg, whole-egg protein) multiplied by 100. This investigation used the chemical score to evaluate the protein quality of 9 parenteral and 17 enteral diets commonly used to feed hospitalized patients. Standard parenteral and enteral products (ie, formulas that had not been designed for patients with a specific disease state) had chemical scores that ranged from 46% to 70%. Limiting amino acids were either methionine (plus cysteine) or phenylalanine (plus tyrosine). Products designed for patients with renal failure had the highest scores, which ranged from 85% to 145%. Products that were enriched with branched-chain amino acids for trauma patients had scores that ranged from 38% to 73%. The only product available for patients with pulmonary compromise had a score of 50%. The lowest scores, which ranged from 5% to 13%, were found in products for patients with hepatic failure. All products, except those with chemical scores below 13%, may be fed in relatively small amounts of protein (7 to 33 g) to satisfy the minimum daily requirements of essential amino acids, although such levels would not meet minimal daily nitrogen requirements. We recommend that dietitians use the chemical score to assess the protein quality of parenteral and enteral diets. \nCecal rupture after continent ileocecal urinary diversion during total pelvic exenteration. Continent ureteral diversion at the time of pelvic exenteration avoids an external appliance and allows patients to retain \"bladder\" reservoir function. The technical difficulty of this procedure requires meticulous attention to operative and perioperative care, particularly after pelvic irradiation. A patient with recurrent stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix underwent total pelvic exenteration with reconstructive procedures including low rectal anastomosis, neovagina formation, and ileocecal (Indiana) continent diversion. Early catheterization of the reservoir began 2 weeks postoperatively. One week later cecal rupture occurred, not related to suture line (technical) failure. Because of the high wall tension and reduced compliance in the irradiated cecum, we do not recommend catheterization of the urinary reservoir before 4-6 weeks. In order for continent diversion to become the standard diversion in exenteration patients, the major complication rate must remain comparable to that of noncontinent diversion. \nPercutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy for common bile duct stones: experience in four high-risk patients. Choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy was applied through a percutaneous transhepatic approach in four high-risk patients with common bile duct stones that were not extractable by duodenoscopic means. All stones were fragmented and removed from three patients, but one patient died from bronchopneumonia before ductal clearance could be achieved. The procedure was well tolerated, without any complication. The major disadvantage is the multiple maneuvers required and the prolonged hospital stay. Percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy provides a safe and effective alternative for nonoperative treatment of common bile duct stones in high-risk patients when the duodenoscopic approach fails. \nEvaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries: correlation of magnetic resonance angiography, duplex ultrasonography, and conventional angiography. We compared duplex scanning, \"bright blood\" and \"black blood\" magnetic resonance angiography, and conventional angiography for evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries. All three methods were applied to 39 vessels in 20 patients. Duplex scanning was inaccurate when compared to conventional angiography in six instances. In three instances the degree of stenosis was overgraded by the scanner, and in three cases the stenosis was undergraded. Magnetic resonance angiography was inaccurate when compared to conventional angiography in three instances. In all cases magnetic resonance angiography overgraded the degree of stenosis. By use of a greater than 70% stenosis as a positive study, the sensitivity of magnetic resonance angiography was 100% and the specificity 92%. With use of the same criteria, the sensitivity of duplex scanning was 86%, and specificity was 84%. In those evaluations where the results of the magnetic resonance angiography and duplex scanning were in agreement, the correlation with conventional angiography was 100%. We conclude that magnetic resonance angiography is an alternative means to duplex scanning for noninvasive carotid imaging. A combination of bright and black blood magnetic resonance angiography is precise in delineating lesions of the extracranial carotid artery and may ultimately eliminate the need for conventional angiography in the evaluation of carotid stenosis. \nPercutaneous balloon valvotomy for the treatment of isolated tricuspid stenosis. A 46-year-old woman with isolated tricuspid stenosis complained of increasing fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Exercise Doppler echocardiography reproduced her symptoms and revealed a marked increase in trans-tricuspid gradient. Successful percutaneous balloon tricuspid valvotomy was performed, with resolution of her symptoms. \nUrticaria and angioedema: diagnosis and evaluation. Because urticaria clears spontaneously in most patients, an extensive workup is not advised during the early weeks of an urticarial eruption. Whether and when to perform a screening workup or a more extensive workup depend on the degree of suspicion that the patient is ill, the urgency with which the patient presses for an answer, and the presence or absence of signs or symptoms that might lead the physician to pursue a diagnosis other than chronic idiopathic urticaria. Angioedema may occur with urticaria, and when it does, the prognosis is worse. Whereas urticaria manifests as circumscribed edema involving the superficial dermis, angioedema involves primarily the deep dermis or subcutaneous or deeper layers. Individual urticarial lesions usually disappear within 2 to 4 hours, whereas those of angioedema can persist for 72 hours. The workup for patients with chronic angioedema can be similar to that for patients with urticaria. However, several additional diagnostic possibilities should be pursued in patients with angioedema, such as hereditary angioedema caused by C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency, because anabolic steroids are effective in the treatment of these conditions. \nHemodynamic effects of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy. BACKGROUND. The somatostatin analogue, ectrootide, is being used to treat postprandial hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Although the therapeutic effect of the drug is presumably secondary to a splanchnic vasoconstrictor action, its effect on splanchnic hemodynamics has never been characterized in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Moreover, it is unknown whether octreotide acts on other vascular beds in this group of patients or whether it affects cardiac output. We, therefore, measured splanchnic, forearm, and systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output before and after administering octreotide (0.4 microgram/kg s.c.) to patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy and diabetic autonomic neuropathy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Splanchnic blood flow was determined from the clearance of indocyanine green in seven patients. We observed that octreotide decreased splanchnic blood flow (from 850 +/- 77 to 664 +/- 48 ml/min, p less than 0.005), increased mean blood pressure (from 97 +/- 6 to 115 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.005), and increased splanchnic vascular resistance (from 0.118 +/- 0.012 to 0.18 +/- 0.018 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.005). Forearm blood flow was measured by plethysmography in 13 patients. Octreotide increased forearm vascular resistance in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (n = 8) from 19.1 +/- 1.0 to 27.2 +/- 3.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml forearm volume (p less than 0.01) and from 25.2 +/- 3.9 to 41.0 +/- 6.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.01) in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (n = 5). Cardiac output was measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Octreotide administration increased cardiac output in five of six patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.5 l/min, p less than 0.02) and five of five patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (from 3.8 +/- 0.4 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 l/min, p less than 0.02). Systemic vascular resistance increased in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy from 21.2 +/- 2 to 24.9 +/- 2.6 (p less than 0.05) but did not change in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. CONCLUSION. The pressor effect of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy is associated with increased splanchnic and forearm vascular resistance and with increased cardiac output. \nPersistence of hepatitis B viral DNA after serological recovery from hepatitis B virus infection. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a major medical problem worldwide. Apart from HBsAg carriers, hepatitis B virus has also been identified in some HBsAg-individuals with or without antibodies to viral antigens. The molecular mechanisms underlying hepatitis B virus persistence in HBsAg-individuals are unresolved, however. To identify a possible genetic basis for viral persistence, we cloned the viral genome from the liver of a patient serologically immune to hepatitis B virus infection. DNA sequence analysis of the complete viral genome identified numerous mutations in all viral genes. Analysis of the biological effects of these mutations revealed three major findings: a low level of HBsAg synthesis, absence of HBeAg production and a defect terminating viral replication. These data suggest that mutations accumulating during the natural course of hepatitis B virus infection may be a mechanism underlying viral persistence in HBsAg-individuals, presumably through escape from immune surveillance. \nComplete ophthalmoplegia as a complication of acute corticosteroid- and pancuronium-associated myopathy. We report acute complete external ophthalmoplegia and severe myopathy in a patient treated with high doses of IV methylprednisolone and pancuronium. Awareness of this rare syndrome in a common clinical setting can lead to prompt recognition and avoid confusion with other causes of acute weakness and ophthalmoparesis. \nFeasibility of universal screening mammography. Lessons from a community intervention. It is estimated that 44,500 American women will die of breast cancer in 1991. The breast cancer screening guidelines of the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute calling for annual mammography for all women older than 50 years have been endorsed by numerous professional groups. Third-party reimbursement for screening mammography is becoming more prevalent, and payment for screening mammography is now a Medicare benefit. Our studies, conducted as part of a National Cancer Institute grant to increase the routine use of screening mammography and clinical breast examination in women 50 to 75 years of age, have uncovered a number of significant barriers to the implementation of screening guidelines among women, primary care physicians, and providers of mammography services. These barriers, as well as methods to assure the quality of mammography, need to be addressed before universal screening is feasible. \nThe association of laryngoceles with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. The clinical diagnosis of laryngoceles simultaneously occurring with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx is infrequent; however, when specimens from patients with laryngeal cancer have been examined closely, the two entities have been associated in 4.9% to 28.8% of cases. Despite this apparent relationship, the literature has failed to address the potential impact of a concurrent laryngocele on surgical decision making. Also, the wide variation in the reported rates of simultaneous occurrence of these two entities is unexplained. We performed whole-organ histopathologic analysis on a laryngeal specimen with bilateral external laryngoceles associated with squamous cell carcinoma and correlated this to computed tomography findings. Based on this information and other reports concerning the pattern of spread of carcinoma within laryngoceles, it appears that supraglottic laryngectomy is oncologically sound in the presence of a laryngocele as long as the usual criteria for this procedure are met. \nEsophageal motility disorders and chest pain. Motility abnormalities have long been recognized as a possible esophageal cause of chest pain; however, their exact role and prevalence remain largely unknown. Baseline manometry and the various provocative tests may suggest an esophageal origin, but their yield is low. The recent advent of prolonged ambulatory monitoring of intraesophageal pressure and the assessment of psychological factors are contributing to a clearer understanding of this complex problem. \nAbsent left main coronary artery: angiographic findings in 83 patients with separate ostia of the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries at the left aortic sinus. Among 20,332 adult patients who underwent consecutive cardiac catheterization and coronary arteriography, 83 (0.4%) were angiographically identified as having an absent left main coronary artery. The angiographic characteristics of this coronary anomaly include: (1) the presence of two well-separated coronary ostia at the left aortic sinus resulting in separate origin of the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries; (2) an increased incidence of left coronary dominance; (3) a higher (6%) than usual (0.5% to 1.5%) incidence of myocardial bridging; (4) lack of a high incidence of congenital heart anomalies; and (5) an incidence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease similar to that of patients whose left main artery is intact. In 39% of the patients difficulties in selectively cannulating the separate ostium of the circumflex artery and adequately opacifying this vessel resulted in a need to change the diagnostic catheter size. Recognition of this coronary anomaly is needed to ensure accurate angiographic interpretation and is important for patients undergoing cardiac surgery to selectively perfuse these separate vessels during cardiopulmonary bypass. \nPopliteal aneurysm with spontaneous arteriovenous fistula. This report documents a rare manifestation of aneurysmal disease of the popliteal artery. We describe a popliteal aneurysm presenting with acute venous hypertension due to a spontaneously occurring arteriovenous fistula. The fistula was defunctionalized by treating the aneurysm with a standard technique of exclusion and bypass with resolution of the symptoms of venous hypertension and maintenance of normal distal perfusion. \nLiver dysfunction associated with long-term total parenteral nutrition in patients with massive bowel resection. Sixteen patients with massive bowel resection receiving long-term home total parenteral nutrition (HTPN) for 31 to 145 months were reviewed for evidence of liver disease. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 with duodenocolostomy (n = 3), group 2 with an estimated 15-43 cm residual small bowel (n = 7), and group 3 with an estimated 55-120 cm residual small bowel (n = 6). Two patients in group 1 developed liver cirrhosis; one was diabetic and died of sepsis and liver failure at the 88th month on HTPN; the other died of lung cancer at the 46th month on HTPN. The third patient, followed for 33 months, had transient severe liver function abnormalities associated with a blood transfusion. In groups 2 and 3, only one patient (with a history of probable liver disease before HTPN) developed biopsy-proven cirrhosis at the 60th month of HTPN. All four patients with clinically apparent liver disease developed persistent elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) early in HTPN. Four other patients (all in group 3) with abnormal AST values in the early phase of HTPN normalized them later; they did not develop clinical liver disease over a mean follow-up time of 110 months (range, 39-152). None of the remaining eight patients (seven in group 2 and one in group 3) had significant liver function test abnormalities and none developed clinical liver disease over a mean follow-up period of 72 months (range, 39-120). \nPrenatal hepatitis B testing in a midsize southern city. Universal prenatal screening for hepatitis B in low-risk populations remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to characterize the obstetric population of the city/county hospital in a midsize southern city. A total of 2013 patients were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody between June 1988 and February 1990, with 1893 negative for both, 105 (5.2%) positive for surface antibody, and 15 (0.8%) positive for surface antigen. Only 25% of the patients with positive results of hepatitis B screening would have been identified by the 1984 Centers for Disease Control risk group criteria, and no other predictive features were identified. We conclude that universal prenatal screening for hepatitis B is indicated in low-risk populations because of the high prevalence and the lack of predictive features. \nHypertension sustains plaque progression despite reduction of hypercholesterolemia. To assess the effect of hypertension on diet-induced coronary artery plaques after a return to a nonatherogenic diet, 10 cynomolgus monkeys were fed an induction regimen containing 2% cholesterol and 25% peanut oil for 6 months and then were subjected to midthoracic aortic coarctation to induce hypertension. The animals were then fed a nonatherogenic \"prudent\" ration for 6 additional months (hypertension-regression group). Twelve additional monkeys were fed the atherogenic diet for 6 months; six were killed (lesion-induction control group) and six were changed to the prudent diet for 6 additional months without coarctation (normotension-regression control group). At the end of the induction period, cholesterol levels averaged 744 +/- 178 mg/dl for the 22 animals and were similar for the three groups throughout the induction period. For the animals restored to the nonatherogenic diet (hypertension-regression and normotension-regression groups), serum cholesterol levels fell to 486 +/- 252 mg/dl at 1 month, to 341 +/- 162 mg/dl at 2 months, and to 234 +/- 78 mg/dl at 6 months. There was no significant difference between the hypertensive and normotensive animals. Six months after coarctation, blood pressure proximal to the coarctations for the hypertension-regression group ranged from 100/60 to 220/145 mm Hg with a mean of 166/103 +/- 36/28 mm Hg. Cross-sectional area of coronary plaques was somewhat lower for the normotension-regression control group compared with the lesion-induction control group, but the difference was not significant. Plaque area was, however, markedly greater in the hypertension-regression group than in either the lesion-induction or the normotension-regression groups (p less than 0.05 for each) despite progressive reduction in hyperlipidemia. \nPublic health consequences of acute displacement of Iraqi citizens--March-May 1991. In late March 1991, following military and civil strife in Iraq, approximately 400,000 ethnic Kurds and other Iraqi minority groups sought refuge in rugged mountains on the border of Iraq and Turkey; an additional estimated 1.3 million Iraqi refugees fled to Iran. In contrast to groups affected in other recent refugee emergencies, a large proportion of this displaced population comprised educated urban dwellers. This report describes the major public health consequences of this population displacement and international relief efforts directed toward these problems. \nSerum interleukin-6 levels correlate with disease status in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a wide range of effects, including induction of B-cell and cytotoxic T-cell differentiation, and induction of acute phase reactant production by hepatocytes. Interleukin-6 also can act as an autocrine growth factor in malignancy. Various cell types produce interleukin-6, including T and B cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and some solid tumor cells. In previous work we detected the production of substantial amounts of interleukin-6 by human ovarian cancer cells, including the ovarian cancer cell lines CAOV-3, OVCAR-3, and SKOV-3, and several primary ovarian tumor cultures. In this study we retrospectively examined 90 separate serum specimens for interleukin-6 in 36 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. The mean serum interleukin-6 concentration of those ovarian cancer patients with macroscopic disease (n = 57) was 0.26 +/- 0.04 U/ml (mean +/- SEM). Healthy adult donors have interleukin-6 serum levels of 0.12 +/- 0.03 U/ml. Sixteen of 21 ovarian cancer patients with macroscopic disease (76%) had elevated (greater than 0.20 U/ml) levels of serum interleukin-6, with levels approaching 1 U/ml in some patients (p less than 0.01). Of those nine patients with bulky tumor (residual greater than 2 cm), eight (89%) had an elevated interleukin-6 level (mean, 0.31 +/- 0.05), while eight of 12 (66%) with minimal residual disease (less than 2 cm) had elevated levels. Only two of 15 (13%) patients who were in clinical remission and who had microscopic disease had elevated values. Of the 36 patients, 22 were CA 125 negative (less than 35 U/ml), and of these, four had elevated interleukin-6 levels. Of the 14 patients with an elevated CA 125 level, 12 (86%) had elevated interleukin-6 levels. In those 16 patients in whom serial levels of interleukin-6 were measured, rising levels were found over a 3 to 4 month interval in nine (56%); this correlated with tumor progression. Furthermore, the subsequent survival of patients was shown to correlate with the level of interleukin-6, such that patients whose levels were elevated greater than 0.20 U/ml interleukin-6 survived a mean of 12.5 months, compared with 27.2 months for patients with normal levels (p less than 0.001). These data support the concept that interleukin-6 may be a useful tumor marker in some patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, as it correlates with the tumor burden, clinical disease status, and survival. \nThe nature of congenital posterior cervical or cervicothoracic midline cutaneous mass lesions. Report of eight cases. Between 4% and 8% of cases of spina bifida cystica occur in a cervical or cervicothoracic location. Despite a large body of literature concerning spinal dysraphism, there has been little written specifically about patients afflicted with this disorder in a cervical location. Eight children who presented at birth with posterior cervical or cervicothoracic lumps, all of which represented a dysraphic state, are discussed. Two types of abnormalities were noted. Three patients had hydromyelia with an associated myelocystocele herniating posteriorly into a meningocele sac. In these three patients there was an associated Chiari II malformation and hydrocephalus. The other five children had a meningocele in which a band of tissue extended from the posterior aspect of the spinal cord through a defect in the bone and fascia to the posterior part of the meningocele sac itself. No patient had a lesion that could be described as a meningomyelocele. The investigation and surgical management of these conditions are discussed and the need for intradural exploration to untether the spinal cord in the cervical region is stressed. \nMSG and hydrolyzed vegetable protein induced headache: review and case studies. Monosodium glutamate (MSG), an established headache trigger, has become far more prevalent in canned, packaged and prepared foods over the past decade. The presence of MSG in food may be difficult to detect since the terms \"natural flavor,\" \"flavoring,\" or \"hydrolyzed vegetable protein (HVP),\" all may appear on food labels to refer to MSG, according to current FDA food labeling codes. HVP typically contains 10-30% MSG. Case studies are presented in which the elimination of all food sources of MSG resulted in decreased headache frequency. Information and food lists helpful in identifying dietary MSG and HVP are presented. When patients are put on an MSG-free trial diet, attention needs to be given to identification of the wide variety of foods containing MSG and HVP. \nIdentification of false positive exercise tests with use of electrocardiographic criteria: a possible role for atrial repolarization waves Atrial repolarization waves are opposite in direction to P waves, may have a magnitude of 100 to 200 mu V and may extend into the ST segment and T wave. It was postulated that exaggerated atrial repolarization waves during exercise could produce ST segment depression mimicking myocardial ischemia. The P waves, PR segments and ST segments were studied in leads II, III, aVF and V4 to V6 in 69 patients whose exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) suggested ischemia (100 mu V horizontal or 150 mu V upsloping ST depression 80 ms after the J point). All had a normal ECG at rest. The exercise test in 25 patients (52% male, mean age 53 years) was deemed false positive because of normal coronary arteriograms and left ventricular function (5 patients) or normal stress single photon emission computed tomographic thallium or gated blood pool scans (16 patients), or both (4 patients). Forty-four patients with a similar age and gender distribution, anginal chest pain and at least one coronary stenosis greater than or equal to 80% served as a true positive control group. The false positive group was characterized by 1) markedly downsloping PR segments at peak exercise, 2) longer exercise time and more rapid peak exercise heart rate than those of the true positive group, and 3) absence of exercise-induced chest pain. The false positive group also displayed significantly greater absolute P wave amplitudes at peak exercise and greater augmentation of P wave amplitude by exercise in all six ECG leads than were observed in the true positive group. \nSupravalvar aortic stenosis: a 29-year review of surgical experience Between February 1960 and August 1989, 73 consecutive patients underwent surgical correction for supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) at the Texas Heart Institute. There were 43 male (59%) and 30 female patients (41%) ranging in age from 5 days to 27 years (mean age, 12 years). Preoperatively, 8 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I, 43 in class II, 18 in class III, and 4 in class IV. Of the 73 patients, 62 had localized SVAS and 11 (15%), diffuse SVAS. For all procedures, patients were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Those with localized SVAS were successfully treated with patch aortoplasty, whereas those with diffuse SVAS required either an apicoaortic conduit or extensive end-arterectomy with extended patch aortoplasty. There were eight early deaths (less than or equal to 30 days postoperatively) (11%) and four late deaths (greater than 30 days postoperatively) (6%) in a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 28 years. Sixteen patients (25%) underwent one or more additional operations in the follow-up period. Postoperatively, there were 44 patients in New York Heart Association functional class I and 17 in class II. Preoperative functional class III and class IV (p less than 0.0005), diffuse SVAS (p = 0.05), and the presence of associated congenital defects (p less than 0.01) were important determinants of death. \nAn innovative method for neuraxis radiotherapy using partial transmission block technique. Whole CNS (neuraxis) radiotherapy is an important part of therapy for certain CNS tumours which seed via the CSF. Many, if not the majority, of these predominantly young patients are cured but the neuropsychometric, neuroendocrine and growth morbidity of neuraxis radiotherapy on children by conventional methods may be considerable; patients receiving such therapy at an early age often are eventually in the educationally subnormal category. Recent radiobiological data support the concept that all aspects of CNS radiation tolerance are heavily dependent on daily fraction size. We describe a new radiotherapy technique that allows lower daily fraction sizes to be delivered to the neuraxis without prejudicing the total dose to the neuraxis or primary area and w",
