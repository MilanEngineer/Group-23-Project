        "text": "ents to changing target locations in eight normal subjects and nine Parkinson's disease (PD) patients before and after medications. Late changes resulted in double trajectories, indicating commitment to the initial target acquisition program followed by a correcting movement. There was compensation for earlier changes, even after onset of agonist muscle activity, resulting in a single trajectory, implying that the original trajectory had not yet been specified. However, movements were slowed in PD patients implying an abnormality in the content of the target acquisition program but not in the timing of its specification. In PD patients, the timing of the second movement onset correlated best with the timing of target location change and did not depend on initial movement completion. Thus, PD patients were able to program the second movement while the first movement was under way. \nSonoelasticity imaging: results in in vitro tissue specimens. The authors present a method for imaging tissue stiffness (sonoelasticity) that has been developed and tested in a laboratory setting by using in vitro canine and human prostate glands. A low-frequency acoustic source was used to induce vibration in tissue under examination, and a color Doppler ultrasound (US) instrument was modified to detect vibration amplitude. The resulting image is a color \"map\" of tissue vibration superimposed on conventional gray-scale US images. Stiffer tissues vibrated less in response to audible sound, regardless of echogenicity. Normal human and canine prostate glands demonstrated a uniform vibration pattern. Four of four human prostatic adenocarcinomas and two stiff inclusions injected into canine prostate glands demonstrated a lack of vibration in comparison with normal surrounding tissue. The authors conclude that while further study is necessary, sonoelasticity imaging may enhance the detection of neoplasms by enabling their identification solely on the basis of stiffness. \nPrognostic factors associated with recurrence in clinical stage I adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Two hundred sixty-four consecutive patients with clinical stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma who underwent primary surgical therapy between July 1979 and August 1988 were followed prospectively and evaluated for disease recurrence for 8-112 months (mean 51.5). Thirty-three patients (12.5%) developed recurrence or died of disease. In univariate statistical analysis, prognostic factors significantly associated with disease recurrence were as follows: age (mean 68.6 years with versus 60.3 years without recurrence; P = .0001); histology (adenocarcinoma 8.8%, adenosquamous 35.7%, papillary 25%, clear-cell 57.1%; P less than .0001); tumor grade (grade 1, 7.7%, grade 2, 10.5%, grade 3, 36.1%; P less than .0001); depth of myometrial invasion (none 9.8%, less than one-half 7.4%, one-half or greater 29.6%; P = .0001); lymph node status (negative 8.3%, positive 47.6%; P less than .0001); non-nodal extrauterine disease spread (absent 11.0%, present 50%; P = .0003); peritoneal cytology (negative 9.4%, positive 26.3%; P = .004), and tumor size (2 cm or less 7%, greater than 2 cm 17.3%; P = .05). Cervical extension and uterine size had no significant effect on recurrence. Using multivariate analysis, grade 3 tumor (P = .002), advancing age (P = .004), lymph node metastasis (P = .006), and presence of extrauterine disease spread other than lymph node metastasis (P = .038) were the only variables significantly associated with disease recurrence or death. This study supports the new International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics surgical staging system for endometrial cancer. \nPreoperative and postoperative \"aneurysm\" associated with coarctation of the aorta. The reported incidence of aortic aneurysm after surgical repair or balloon angioplasty for aortic coarctation varies widely. To determine the incidence of aneurysm formation after surgery, preoperative and postoperative cineangiograms from 65 patients who underwent operation at age 1.5 +/- 3.4 years were examined. Repair included a prosthetic patch in 14 patients, end to end anastomosis in 28 and subclavian flap in 23. Aneurysm was documented by change in contour or irregularities in contour at the repair site or by abnormal dimensions at the repair site, defined by the ratio of the widest measurement at the repair site to the measurement of the aorta at the diaphragm. An aneurysmal bulge above the ductus diverticulum was identified in 14 (23%) of 60 patients preoperatively; the area showed no change 4.72 +/- 4.07 years after surgery. Significant changes at the repair site were seen in only three patients, all of whom had Dacron patch repair. One patient had a change in contour at the repair site, one had an abnormally high repair site to diaphragmatic aorta ratio and one had a progressive increase in this ratio. Thus, during childhood years, 3 (5%) of 65 patients were diagnosed as having aneurysm at the surgical repair site. In conclusion, 1) comparison with preoperative cineangiograms, especially for aneurysmal bulges above the ductus arteriosus, is essential before an aneurysm can be attributed to coarctation repair by any technique, and 2) aneurysm developed only in patients subjected to Dacron patch repair. \nKi-1-positive lymphoma developing 10 years after the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia. The case is described of a 62-year-old man with a 10-year history of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) who subsequently had a large-cell anaplastic or so-called Ki-1-positive lymphoma. Immunocytochemical staining of the lymphomatous node revealed positivity for Ki-1 (CD30) and epithelial membrane antigen in the tumor cells, and flow cytometric analysis showed simultaneous expression of Leu M5 (CD11c) and Leu 14 (CD22). Although HCL has been reported to coexist with both Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the authors believe this is the first case in which a Ki-1-positive lymphoma developed in a patient with HCL. The clinicopathologic and immunologic features of both entities are discussed, as is the association of HCL with other neoplasms. \nEvaluation of a new weaning index based on ventilatory endurance and the efficiency of gas exchange. We hypothesized that the ventilatory capacity needed to wean from mechanical ventilation (mv) depends on two variables: ventilatory endurance and the efficiency of gas exchange. We also hypothesized that these variables could be assessed from data readily available at the bedside, including tidal volume (VT) on mv and during spontaneous breathing (sb), ventilator peak inspiratory pressure (Ppk), and patient negative inspiratory pressure (NIP). Ventilatory endurance was evaluated using a modified pressure-time index: PTI = TI/Ttot x Pbreath/NIP, where Pbreath = Ppk x VTsb/VTmv. Defining VE40 as the minute ventilation needed to bring PaCO2 to 40 mm Hg, the efficiency of gas exchange was evaluated by calculating VE40/VTsb = (VE x PaCO2)mv/VTsb x 40. Because high levels of inspiratory effort might cause patients to reduce VTsb and thereby compromise CO2 elimination, we devised a weaning index (WI) that combines ventilatory endurance and the efficiency of gas exchange: WI = PTI x (VE40/VTsb). The study population comprised 38 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, neuromuscular disease, and miscellaneous other conditions. They had been mechanically ventilated more than 3 days and were considered by clinical criteria to be ready for weaning. Of 46 weaning trials, 19 were successful, 2 were partially successful, and 25 failed. PTI and VE40/VTsb were higher in patients who failed (p less than 0.05), but neither variable alone had sufficient sensitivity or specificity to predict the outcome of weaning trials accurately. \nSymptoms associated with tamoxifen treatment in postmenopausal women. Adjuvant breast cancer therapy with tamoxifen is associated with greater disease-free survival and possibly overall survival. Long-term treatment, possibly of indefinite duration, is being evaluated. Compliance with long-term therapy will depend largely on the nature and severity of tamoxifen's side effects. We evaluated the symptoms associated with tamoxifen therapy in 140 postmenopausal women with axillary node negative breast cancer in remission (mean years since menopause, 9.3) enrolled in a placebo-controlled, randomized toxicity study. Tamoxifen recipients reported moderated or severe vasomotor symptoms up to 17%, and gynecologic symptoms up to 4% more frequently than placebo subjects. Persistent vasomotor, gynecologic, or other major side effects were reported by 48% of tamoxifen recipients, and by 21% of placebo subjects. These carefully collected data suggest significant perceived symptom 'cost' of tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women, of a magnitude likely to compromise long-term compliance. \nNephrotoxic potential of Bence Jones proteins BACKGROUND. The renal manifestations of diseases associated with the production of monoclonal light chains--myeloma (cast) nephropathy, light-chain deposition disease, and amyloidosis AL--result from the deposition of certain Bence Jones proteins as tubular casts, basement-membrane precipitates, or fibrils, respectively. For unknown reasons, the severity of the renal manifestations of these diseases varies greatly from patient to patient. We employed an experimental in vivo model to determine the pathologic importance of various Bence Jones proteins. METHODS. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 300 mg of Bence Jones protein from 40 patients with multiple myeloma or amyloidosis AL and killed 48 hours later. The mouse kidneys were examined by light and electron microscopy, and light-chain deposits were identified immunohistochemically with highly specific antihuman light-chain antiserum. RESULTS. Of the 40 different human Bence Jones proteins studied, 26 were deposited in the mouse kidneys predominantly as tubular casts, basement-membrane precipitates, or crystals; no light-chain deposits were detected in the kidneys of the mice that received the other 14 Bence Jones proteins. Of the 18 patients for whom renal tissue was available for study, the findings in 14 were comparable to those in the mice. Furthermore, the proteins obtained from 22 of the 27 patients whose serum creatinine concentrations equaled or exceeded 168 mumol per liter (1.9 mg per deciliter) were deposited in the mouse kidneys, whereas protein deposition occurred after the injection of proteins from only 4 of the 13 patients with serum creatinine concentrations below 168 mumol per liter. The repeated injection of Bence Jones proteins from two patients who had amyloidosis AL resulted in deposition of the protein in the mouse kidneys as amyloid. CONCLUSIONS. Particular Bence Jones proteins are primarily responsible for producing the distinctive types of protein deposition in renal tissue and the clinical manifestations that occur in patients with light-chain-associated diseases. This experimental model has potential value for the identification of nephrotoxic or amyloidogenic light chains. \nLevel of axillary involvement by lymph node metastases from breast cancer is not an independent predictor of survival. We examined the relationship of axillary level of lymph node metastases from clinical stage I and II breast cancer to overall survival and disease-free survival rates in 135 patients who underwent complete axillary lymph node dissection to determine if anatomic level of axillary involvement (I vs II vs III) is an independent prognostic factor. All patients underwent either modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy with axillary dissection and whole breast radiotherapy for breast cancer. Median follow-up was 6.9 years. We found no difference in overall survival or disease-free survival between patients whose highest or only level of axillary involvement was level I compared with patients whose highest or only level was II. Although patients whose highest level of nodal involvement was III had significantly worse overall survival and disease-free survival rates than patients whose highest nodal involvement was I or II, when patients were stratified by the total number of positive nodes (one to three vs four or more), there was no difference in overall survival or disease-free survival rates between levels I, II, and III. These findings indicate that the level of axillary involvement for stage II breast cancer is not of independent prognostic significance. \nIn situ venous valve construction. A technique of in situ deep venous valve construction based on vein wall intussusception is described. The technique has been used to construct a size-matched, autogenous valve in the femoral vein of the dog. Forty-one valves have been constructed. Immediately after construction, all 41 were patent at ascending phlebography and Harvey's test showed them to be competent. Descending phlebography demonstrated competence in 38 valves. Hydrostatic testing was performed on 27 valves in the vertical position at pressure gradients in the range 0.2-250 cmH2O. Of these, 24 valves were fully competent. Six valves were studied at intervals between 1 and 112 days after construction. All six were competent by Harvey's test and five were competent at descending phlebography. There was no evidence of thrombosis in any valve. This technique may be suitable for replacement of deep venous valves in patients with the calf pump failure syndrome caused by deep venous reflux. \nPrognostic importance of collateral flow and residual coronary stenosis of the myocardial infarct artery after anterior wall Q-wave acute myocardial infarction. Residual high-grade coronary stenosis and collateral flow are frequent findings in the chronic phase after a Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The prognostic importance of a residual stenosis of the infarct artery and of collateral flow to the infarct area was analyzed in a group of 102 young patients (mean age 35 years, range 22 to 39) who had survived an anterior wall Q-wave AMI. Patients whose only significant lesion (greater than 50% luminal diameter reduction) was in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery were enrolled in the study. A 50 to 74% diameter stenosis was present in 33 of 102 patients (32%), 43 (42%) had a 75 to 99% stenosis and 26% had a total occlusion of the infarct vessel. Collateral vessels, which were evaluated by a scoring system, were present in 52 of 102 patients (51%). Four percent had only faint (score 1), 17 of 102 patients (17%) had moderate and 32 patients (31%) had good collateral flow (score greater than 4). The 8-year cumulative mortality was 15.2%--an eightfold increase compared with the age-matched general population. No patient with less than 75% stenosis died during follow-up, whereas the cumulative 8-year mortality was 23 and 17% in patients with a 75 to 99% stenosis or total occlusion, respectively (p less than 0.01). Patients with at least moderate collateral flow had a mortality rate of 21%, versus 8% for patients without or with faint collateral flow (p less than 0.05). \nThe recognition and control of occupational disease. Occupational diseases account each year in the United States for an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 deaths and 350,000 new cases of illness. Often, however, occupational diseases are not correctly diagnosed, because they mimic diseases due to other causes and because most physicians are not well trained in their recognition. Opportunities for prevention and treatment are therefore lost. The occupational history is the most effective means for proper diagnosis of occupational illness. It should routinely be obtained for every patient. A brief but systematic guide for obtaining an occupational history is presented in this report. Also, approaches are summarized for the recognition and diagnosis of such important occupational diseases as occupational cancer, asbestosis and other respiratory disorders, and occupational neuropsychologic disorders. The management and prevention of occupational diseases depend on reduction of hazardous exposures in the workplace and better education of workers, industrial managers, and physicians. This report outlines a program for the control of occupational disease based on (1) preventing exposures in the workplace, (2) premarket toxicity testing of new chemicals and technologies, and (3) astute clinical diagnosis. \nBeneficial effect of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with high-grade carotid stenosis. North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial Collaborators BACKGROUND. Without strong evidence of benefit, the use of carotid endarterectomy for prophylaxis against stroke rose dramatically until the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30 to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the 331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than 0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and ipsilateral high-grade stenosis (70 to 99 percent) of the internal carotid artery. \nEpidemiologic and clinical aspects of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Epidemiologic studies have shown that insulin is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Clinical studies have also demonstrated positive correlations between insulin and blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor. Moreover, there is an inverse correlation between insulin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). These studies have provided evidence in support of the biologic plausibility of epidemiologic observations, but they have not clearly established insulin's role in the pathogenesis of human cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as hypertension. In fact, there is considerable evidence that insulin resistance (abnormal nonoxidative glucose disposal), not hyperinsulinemia, is the primary insulin-related abnormality in human hypertension, and that hyperinsulinemia occurs as a response to insulin resistance. Skeletal muscle appears to be the primary site of insulin resistance in essential hypertension, although other organs, such as the kidneys and liver--key sites for cell and water homeostasis and lipoprotein regulation, respectively--may respond normally to insulin. Adipocytes also appear to be a site of insulin resistance. Thus, the putative interrelationship between hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, on the one hand, and with blood pressure and lipoproteins, on the other, is a complex one and may involve organ-specific insulin resistance. Altered cation transport is one of several mechanisms by which insulin resistance might raise blood pressure. The Na+, K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase pumps are insulin sensitive. Thus, when insulin resistance is present, the activity of these pumps in the smooth muscle of the arterial wall might be reduced. This would lead to an intracellular accumulation of sodium and calcium, thereby sensitizing the vascular wall to pressor substances. Moreover, secondary hyperinsulinemia will occur, and insulin has been shown to stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity and to increase renal tubular absorption of sodium. Insulin is also a growth factor and therefore might have a trophic effect on the vessel wall, one that could initiate and/or sustain hypertension as well as atherosclerosis. Abnormal lipoprotein metabolism is yet another possible explanation for the accelerated atherosclerosis that has been observed in persons with abnormal carbohydrate tolerance and insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance both play a role in the expression of elevated very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels as well as in the depression of HDL levels. Coronary risk reduction has been disappointing when blood pressure has been lowered with treatment regimens based on thiazide diuretics and/or beta blockers. Thiazides and some beta blockers may further impair tissue insulin sensitivity and often cause blood lipoprotein abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nThe natural history of superficial femoral artery stenoses. Since the natural history of specific superficial femoral artery stenoses is not known, we examined progression rates of superficial femoral artery stenoses in 45 lower extremities found when arteriograms were obtained of 38 patients for symptomatic atherosclerotic disease in the opposite leg or abdomen. These initial superficial femoral artery arteriograms were compared with later arteriograms in 25 limbs, duplex scans in 27 limbs, and both modalities in 7 limbs. After a mean interval of 37 months, most superficial femoral artery stenoses (72%) did not progress. However, 12 superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed (28%; mean follow-up, 37 months, including 7 that occluded (17%). Superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed among patients who complained of symptom progression at a rate faster than that among asymptomatic patients (15.6%/year vs 3%/year; p = 0.006). Superficial femoral artery lesions also progressed more rapidly among patients whose contralateral superficial femoral artery was occluded (10%/year vs 1.6%/year; p = 0.04). By multivariate regression analysis, symptom progression and smoking history were predictive of superficial femoral artery stenosis progression. In the seven patients whose superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed to occlusion, the average rate of stenosis progression was 12%/year (maximum predicted rate, 30% per year by 95% confidence limit). These results indicate that superficial femoral artery stenoses usually progress with synchronous symptomatic deterioration. Other than symptom progression, only cumulative smoking history and contralateral superficial femoral artery occlusion could be associated with superficial femoral artery stenosis progression in this small series. \nKnowledge and beliefs about cancer in a socioeconomically disadvantaged population. Americans living in poverty experience a higher incidence of and greater mortality from cancer than the nonpoor. At least 50% of the difference in mortality is believed to be due to delay in diagnosis, although risk-promoting lifestyles and behaviors also contribute to decreased survival. A potential exacerbating factor among the poor is inadequate information and knowledge about cancer and its treatment. Interviews were conducted with 128 cancer patients from a socioeconomically disadvantaged population to assess knowledge of cancer and its treatment and to evaluate care-seeking behaviors. Results indicated that although patients relied primarily on their physicians for information about their disease and treatment, a number of misconceptions regarding cancer existed in this population. Notably, nearly 50% of the patients surveyed either denied or did not know that smoking was related to the development of cancer. Additionally, patients frequently reported inappropriate care-seeking behaviors when asked to respond to a series of common disease-related signs or symptoms. These findings suggest that misinformation and misconceptions regarding cancer and its treatment among patients in this sample may contribute to inappropriate care-seeking behaviors. \nComparative safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B lipid complex and amphotericin B desoxycholate in healthy male volunteers. Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC), a lipid complex formulation of amphotericin B, and amphotericin B desoxycholate (AB) were compared for safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics in two groups of eight healthy male volunteers. After a 1-mg test dose, study drug was infused at 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg; the 0.5-mg/kg dose was not given to subjects receiving AB. ABLC caused few acute adverse effects except for mild somnolence (drowsiness) in six volunteers. In addition, three of eight ABLC recipient had asymptomatic, transient serum transaminase elevations that resolved spontaneously. The AB recipients experienced more acute side effects, but only one had a mild shaking chill: three of eight also experienced sleepiness. No significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, oximetry, pulmonary function, or clinical status were observed in either group. Due to its increased estimate volume of distribution and estimated clearance. ABLC yielded decreased amphotericin B levels and area under the serum concentration versus time curve relative to AB. \nEffects of sleep-induced increases in upper airway resistance on ventilation. To determine the effects of the sleep-induced increases in upper airway resistance on ventilatory output, we studied five subjects who were habitual snorers but otherwise normal while awake (AW) and during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep under the following conditions: 1) stage 2, low-resistance sleep (LRS); 2) stage 3-4, high-resistance sleep (HRS) (snoring); 3) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); 4) CPAP + end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2) mode isocapnic to LRS; and 5) CPAP + PETCO2 isocapnic to HRS. We measured ventilatory output via pneumotachograph in the nasal mask, PETCO2, esophageal pressure, inspiratory and expiratory resistance (RL,I and RL,E). Changes in PETCO2 were confirmed with PCO2 measurements in arterialized venous blood in all conditions in one subject. During wakefulness, pulmonary resistance (RL) remained constant throughout inspiration, whereas in stage 2 and especially in stage 3-4 NREM sleep, RL rose markedly throughout inspiration. Expired minute ventilation (VE) decreased by 12% in HRS, and PETCO2 increased in LRS (3.3 Torr) and HRS (4.9 Torr). CPAP decreased RL,I to AW levels and increased end-expiratory lung volume 0.25-0.93 liter. Tidal volume (VT) and mean inspiratory flow rate (VT/TI) increased significantly with CPAP. Inspiratory time (TI) shortened, and PETCO2 decreased 3.6 Torr but remained 1.3 Torr above AW. During CPAP (RL,I equal to AW), with PETCO2 returned to the level of LRS, VT/TI and VE were 83 and 52% higher than during LRS alone. Also on CPAP, with PETCO2 made equal to HRS, VT, VT/TI, and VE were 67, 112, and 67% higher than during HRS alone. \nTotal arthroplasty of the hip after childhood sepsis. Total hip arthroplasty was performed in 45 hips of 44 patients who had pyogenic arthritis of the hip during childhood. The average age of the patients was 36.4 years (range 19 to 50). The interval between active infection and arthroplasty ranged from 11 to 40 years, and average follow-up was 65.4 months (range 58 to 80). Specimens of tissue taken before and during operation gave negative cultures in all hips, and no patient had reactivation of infection. The mean functional rating of the hips was 58 points before operation and 90 at the final review. Complications were seen in 11 cases (24%), loosening of components occurred in six (13%) and one hip had to be revised for acetabular component migration. Acetabular allografts were required in 27 hips (60%). All allografts united but there was partial resorption of the graft in the non-weight-bearing area in all. \nHemorrhagic venous infarction after excision of an arteriovenous malformation: case report. A case of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in which postoperative hemorrhagic infarction developed, probably because of occlusion of the former draining veins, is reported. The hemorrhage developed in the temporal lobe 3 days after the initial operation and was located in the immediate vicinity of the site of the AVM. The following findings suggest that the postsurgical hemorrhage probably resulted from a venous thrombosis: 1) no evidence of residual AVM; 2) delayed onset of the hemorrhage, inconsistent with the time course of a hemorrhage developing according to the breakthrough theory or with insufficient hemostasis with a high-pressure afterload; 3) good correlation between the location of the hemorrhage and the occlusion of the draining veins; and 4) multifocal hemorrhage affecting both the gray matter and the subcortical white matter. Postoperative hemorrhagic infarction caused by thrombosis in the draining veins is rare, but it should be considered as a distinct postoperative complication after removal of an AVM. \nCell recovery during segmental intestinal perfusion in healthy subjects and patients with Crohn's disease. The recovery of cells arising from small intestinal mucosa alone was studied during continuous perfusion of a closed segment of jejunum. The perfusion technique minimised the contamination of the perfused segment with, for example, proteolytic enzymes from pancreas, allowing recovery of viable cells. The use of hyaluronidase in the perfusion fluid increased the recovery of cells fivefold, the median recovery being 8 x 10(6) cells. The cells were analysed with monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. Nearly all cells (98-99%) recovered during perfusion of healthy control subjects and patients with Crohn's disease were epithelial cells. The jejunal cells expressed HLA-DR in similar proportions--around 30%--in patients and control subjects. The ratio between CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes was similar (0.2) in control subjects and patients with inactive Crohn's disease but decreased (0.03) in patients with active Crohn's disease in the ileum. \nCandidal mediastinitis after surgical repair of esophageal perforation. Candidal mediastinitis, like Boerhaave's syndrome, is uncommon, and both, if treated late or incompletely, frequently result in death. Early recognition and aggressive medical and surgical intervention are the best means to convalescence and cure in both conditions. \nPostischemic myocardial \"stunning\". Identification of major differences between the open-chest and the conscious dog and evaluation of the oxygen radical hypothesis in the conscious dog. Recent studies suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals contribute to the pathogenesis of postischemic myocardial dysfunction (myocardial \"stunning\"). This concept, however, is predicated exclusively on results obtained in open-chest preparations, which are subject to the confounding influence of many unphysiological conditions. The lack of supporting evidence in more physiological animal models represents a major persisting limitation of the oxy-radical hypothesis of myocardial stunning. The goal of this study was to address two fundamental (and related) questions: 1) Does the open-chest animal model alter the phenomenon of myocardial stunning? 2) If so, how valid are the concepts, derived from such a model, regarding the pathogenetic role of oxy-radicals? In part 1 of the study, myocardial stunning after a 15-minute coronary occlusion was compared in 30 pentobarbital-anesthetized open-chest dogs and in 19 conscious dogs. For any given level of collateral flow during occlusion, the recovery of systolic wall thickening after reperfusion was markedly less in open-chest animals. In an additional group of five open-chest dogs, a close inverse relation was noted between body temperature and postischemic wall thickening, indicating that the recovery of the stunned myocardium in acute experiments may vary markedly depending on how temperature is controlled. Because of these major differences between open-chest and conscious dogs, the oxy-radical hypothesis needs to be tested in the latter model. Thus, in part 2 of the study, conscious unsedated dogs undergoing a 15-minute coronary occlusion were randomized to an intravenous infusion of either saline (19 coronary occlusions) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) plus catalase (CAT) (21 coronary occlusions). Despite the fact that the plasma levels of SOD and CAT declined rapidly after reperfusion, postischemic wall thickening was significantly greater in treated compared with control dogs throughout the first 6 hours of reflow. Thus, a brief (60-minute) infusion of SOD and CAT produced a sustained improvement of recovery of contractility. The magnitude of this beneficial effect was a function of the severity of ischemia: the lower the collateral perfusion, the greater the improvement effected by the enzymes. The accelerated recovery produced by SOD and CAT was not followed by any deterioration of contractility, suggesting that postischemic dysfunction is not a teleologically \"protective\" phenomenon. In conclusion, the severity of myocardial stunning is greatly exaggerated by the unphysiological conditions present in the barbiturate-anesthetized open-chest dog.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nSuppressor T-cell deficiency in primary sclerosing cholangitis. Case and family study. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is considered to be an autoimmune disease of the liver in which there is an association with the HLA phenotypes B8 and DR3 and in which circulating autoantibodies occur. Abnormalities of immune regulation may be present but whether or not they are primary or acquired is not known. This report is of a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis who was homozygous for HLA B8 DR3, had a circulating antinuclear antibody, and a defect in nonspecific suppressor T-cell activity despite glucocorticosteroid treatment. Nevertheless, family studies revealed no evidence of an immunoregulatory defect in first-degree relatives despite the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon and malignancy in two sisters. \nChondroblastomalike extraskeletal chondroma. An unusual extraskeletal tumor occurring in the right thumb of a 44-year-old man exhibited histologically a chondroblastomalike appearance. The tumor was characterized by dense proliferation of chondroblastic cells admixed with a few multinucleated giant cells of osteoclast type. The patient had no evidence of local recurrence or metastasis three-and-a-half years after a simple excision. \nNovel approach to iatrogenic bile peritonitis. Bile peritonitis after injury to the biliary tree is a serious complication that requires exploratory laparotomy. Our patient had an obstructing ampullary carcinoma, and generalized bile peritonitis developed from attempted percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. The patient's condition was managed by peritoneal lavage and endoscopic transampullary stenting, with immediate relief of pain and toxicity. Exploratory laparotomy was avoided, and an eventual pylorus-sparing Whipple resection was the definitive treatment. We believe this to be the first report of successful nonoperative treatment of a patient with bile peritonitis with obstructive jaundice. \nPrognostic value of galactose elimination capacity, aminopyrine breath test, and ICG clearance in patients with cirrhosis. Comparison with the Pugh score. Seventy-eight patients with cirrhosis were prospectively followed for up to 20 months, on the average. At entry into the study, galactose elimination capacity, aminopyrine breath test, and ICG clearance were measured. At the end of the study, 27 patients had died. Univariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method showed that both quantitative liver function tests (galactose elimination capacity: P less than 0.025; aminopyrine breath test: P less than 0.001; ICG clearance: P less than 0.005) and common clinical and biochemical data (encephalopathy: P less than 0.001; ascites: P less than 0.001; serum bilirubin: P less than 0.005; serum albumin: P less than 0.001; prothrombin index: P less than 0.05) were significant predictors of survival. To investigate whether quantitative liver function tests could contribute to a better definition of the prognosis, once Pugh score had already been taken into account, a multiple regression analysis according to the Cox model was performed. Pugh score and galactose elimination capacity resulted in the only independent prognostic covariates. From them a prognostic index was calculated, and the model was validated in an additional sample of 70 patients investigated according to the same protocol. The contribution GEC gave to the assessment of overall prognosis over that obtained using the Pugh score was slight, as estimated by the statistical parameters of the Cox's model, but was significant as assessed by a ROC curve analysis (P = 0.05). These data show that all quantitative liver function tests were predictors of survival in cirrhosis, and that the galactose elimination capacity added some new prognostic information to those already available using the Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification. \nRegional differences in elastic recoil after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty: a quantitative angiographic study. The immediate result of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is influenced by both plastic and elastic changes of the vessel wall. To evaluate the amount of elastic recoil after coronary balloon angioplasty, the minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the largest balloon used at highest inflation pressure was compared with the minimal luminal vessel cross-sectional area directly after final balloon deflation in 607 lesions (526 patients). Elastic recoil was defined as the difference between balloon cross-sectional area and minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the dilated coronary segment immediately after balloon withdrawal. A videodensitometric analysis technique was used to avoid geometric assumptions on stenosis morphology directly after angioplasty. Mean balloon cross-sectional area was 5.3 +/- 1.6 mm2 and minimal luminal cross-sectional area after angioplasty was 2.8 +/- 1.4 mm2. Reference areas before and after angioplasty did not differ (6.0 +/- 2.6 and 6.2 +/- 2.6 mm2, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed that asymmetric lesions, lesions located in less angulated parts of the artery and lesions with a low plaque content showed more elastic recoil. Lesions located in distal parts of the coronary tree were also associated with more elastic recoil probably related to relative balloon oversizing in these distal lesions. \nDifferentiation in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell populations with CD34-positive subpopulations. B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia bone marrow specimens that contained subpopulations of cells with immunophenotypes corresponding to early (CD34) and late (CD20) and (CD22) stages of normal B-cell differentiation were studied. Subpopulations of cells were isolated according to immunophenotype and then analyzed by both a clonogenic assay and molecular genetic methods. Clonal equivalence of the early and late immunophenotypic subpopulations was confirmed for each case by the demonstration of identical lg gene rearrangements. The in vitro colony-forming assay consistently showed a growth advantage for the CD34+ subpopulations over the CD34- subpopulations. CD34 mRNA was detected readily in these isolated precursor cells. When two specimens in which virtually all of the leukemia cells were CD34+ and CD34+CD20+ and CD34+CD22+ subpopulations were also present the CD34 mRNA was limited to the cells without the late-stage differentiation antigens on their surface. Furthermore, the c-myb mRNA was found only in the subpopulations that also contained CD34 mRNA. Our results show that a limited program of differentiation reminiscent of normal B-cell development may be present in this leukemia. \nGlobal T wave inversion. Because global T wave inversion has not been specifically characterized, 100 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with this pattern (frontal plane T vector -100 degrees to -170 degrees with precordial T inversion) were prospectively collected from approximately 30,000 consecutively interpreted ECGs and analyzed blindly. There was a striking female predominance (82 women vs. 18 men; p less than 0.0005) despite an essentially equal number of female and male hospital admissions. There was a single statistically significant ECG correlate: a more vertical QRS axis in women (+14.1 degrees +/- 45.3 degrees vs. -5.6 degrees +/- 31.3 degrees; p = 0.034). The T waves were basically symmetric (68%), the influence of this factor usually altering the characteristically asymmetric T wave inversions of right bundle branch block (4 of 5) and left ventricular hypertrophy (21 of 36). Asymmetry was mainly associated with digoxin therapy (21 of 32 patients taking digoxin; p less than or equal to 0.0005) and a corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.433 +/- 0.095) shorter than with symmetric T wave inversions (0.507 +/- 0.074; p less than or equal to 0.0005) though not reaching the degree of shortening expected for digitalization. Twenty-eight patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and 23 for a central nervous system disorder accounted for the majority of patients with symmetric T wave inversion. Fifteen of 18 patients who had coronary angiography had some degree of coronary artery disease: 3 had angiographically normal coronary arteries. \nSomato-somatic referred pain caused by suprasegmental spinal cord tumor. Tactile stimulation of a coin-sized area in a T-2 dermatome consistently triggered a lancinating pain in the ipsilateral C-8 dermatome in a 38-year-old woman. The SEP and an MRI led to a diagnosis of a tumor at the left cervico-medullary junction, much higher than the clinically suspected level. Surgical exploration revealed an exophytic glioma, and the pain was abolished postoperatively. Ephaptic transmission at the tumor site was suspected as a pathophysiologic mechanism. \nEarly constrictive pericarditis and anemia after Dressler's syndrome and inferior wall myocardial infarction. Early constrictive pericarditis and anaemia developed in a 52 year old man after he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction complicated by Dressler's syndrome. Total pericardiectomy at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery resulted in complete resolution of signs and symptoms. \nEffect of sinorphan, an enkephalinase inhibitor, on plasma atrial natriuretic factor and sodium urinary excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites. We examined the acute effects of sinorphan, an inhibitor of enkephalinase, on plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and urinary sodium excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites. A single oral dose of sinorphan (100 or 30 mg in 11 and 5 patients, respectively) was administered against placebo according to a double blind cross-over protocol. Basal plasma ANF levels varied over a large range between 2.6-79 pmol/L. Sinorphan, at a dose of 100 mg, inhibited 70% of plasma enkephalinase activity 60 min after ingestion and elicited simultaneously an increase in plasma ANF and cGMP levels 1.8 and 1.5 times basal values, respectively. There was a transient increase in sodium urinary output without a change in creatinine clearance over the initial 2-h period following drug administration. An increase in urinary cGMP was also observed on a longer period of 6 h. Plasma aldosterone decreased significantly, but the lowest concentration was reached 1 h later than the peak of plasma ANF. Mean blood pressure and PRA were unmodified. The effects of 30 mg sinorphan on plasma ANF, cGMP, and aldosterone were also significant, but less marked than those of the higher dose. Therefore, enkephalinase inhibition transiently increases sodium urinary excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites via a mechanism that is likely to imply reduction of ANF catabolism. These results suggest that ANF could play a role in the control of sodium homeostasis in liver cirrhosis with ascites. \nAneurysm of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery unrelated to the cerebellopontine angle: case report. This is a case report of an unusual aneurysm of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery. A 44-year-old woman had a severe frontal headache and vomiting of sudden onset. On the day after admission, the patient began to demonstrate nuchal rigidity and difficulty with upward gaze bilaterally. There were no complaints at this time suggestive of a syndrome of the cerebellopontine angle. A computed tomographic scan revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage of the 3rd and 4th ventricles; however, multiple attempts at four-vessel angiography were required before an aneurysm could be demonstrated. On the 28th hospital day, a suboccipital craniectomy using the retromastoid approach in the lateral position was performed. A saccular aneurysm with a surrounding hematoma in the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery was found and clipped. The operative findings revealed that the aneurysm was unrelated to the cerebellopontine angle. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery and complete resolution of symptoms. \nCancer incidence in Norwegian Seventh-Day Adventists 1961 to 1986. Is the cancer-life-style association overestimated? Standardized incidence ratio for cancer in Norwegian Seventh-Day Adventists compared with the general population was not significantly different from unity (men 91, women 97). Persons converting late in life had a higher incidence than those converting at an earlier age. Respiratory cancers (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 59, 95% CI = 36 to 91) and cancers with an unspecified site (SIR 53, 95% CI = 25 to 97) were rarer and cancer of the uterine corpus (SIR 164, 95% CI = 109 to 237) was more common in Seventh-Day Adventists before the age of 75 years. Inclusion of all registered Seventh-Day Adventists regardless of religious activity and the relatively low cancer incidence rates in the Norwegian population could contribute to the nonsignificant result with regard to total cancer. Main etiologic factors in cancer development in Norway should be sought in areas where Seventh-Day Adventists do not differ from the general population. \nEpileptogenic effect of hypoxia in the immature rodent brain. The response to cerebral hypoxia/ischemia may be different in the neonate compared to other age groups. An in vivo model was developed in the rat to determine whether there are age-dependent differences in the effects of hypoxia on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. EEG recordings were obtained from Long Evans hooded rats deprived of oxygen at five ages: postnatal days 5 to 7, 10 to 12, 15 to 17, 25 to 27, and 50 to 60. Oxygen concentration was varied from 0, 2, 3, and 4% between animals. EEGs were recorded in all animals before, during, and at 1 hour after exposure to the hypoxic condition and at 1 to 7 days afterward in a subset of animals. All animals were deprived of oxygen until the onset of apnea and bradycardia to 20 to 40% of baseline heart rate values. Hypoxia resulted in isoelectric EEG significantly more frequently in the animals deprived of oxygen at postnatal days 25 to 27 and 50 to 60 than in the younger age groups. A highly significant effect was that the animals deprived at postnatal days 5 to 17 revealed a high incidence of epileptiform EEG activity during hypoxia. In contrast, the older animals exhibited only rare isolated EEG spikes before reaching an isoelectric EEG. The severity of hypoxia-induced epileptiform EEG changes was highest in the animals subjected to moderately hypoxic conditions (3% and 4% oxygen) at postnatal days 10 to 12. Furthermore, epileptiform changes persisted for hours to days following prolonged episodes of hypoxia in the younger animals. This study demonstrates a unique response of the immature brain to exhibit epileptiform activity during hypoxia. \nChildhood cancer among the Polynesian population. From June 1981 through June 1989, 95 Polynesian children were seen for initial care of malignancy at the Princess Mary Hospital for Children (PMHC). The incidence of malignancy in the Polynesian populations served, the histology of the malignancies, and the outcome of therapy were reviewed and compared with 185 non-Polynesian (non-P) patients seen during the same period. Incidence figures for Polynesians and non-P were similar, but histologic patterns differed, showing an increased occurrence of leukemia, particularly nonlymphoblastic leukemia, an increased occurrence of bone tumors, and a decreased incidence of central nervous system tumors for Polynesians. Survival for Polynesian children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was worse than for non-P. Survival in all other disease categories was similar. \nHemorrhagic events during therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, heparin, and aspirin for acute myocardial infarction. Results of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), Phase II Trial. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of invasive procedures, hemostatic and clinical variables, the timing of beta-blocker therapy, and the doses of recombinant plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on hemorrhagic events. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Hospitals participating in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II trial (TIMI II). INTERVENTIONS: Patients received rt-PA, heparin, and aspirin. The total dose of rt-PA was 150 mg for the first 520 patients and 100 mg for the remaining 2819 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to an invasive strategy (coronary arteriography with percutaneous angioplasty [if feasible] done routinely 18 to 48 hours after the start of thrombolytic therapy) or to a conservative strategy (coronary arteriography done for recurrent spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia). Eligible patients were also randomly assigned to either immediate intravenous or deferred beta-blocker therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were monitored for hemorrhagic events during hospitalization. MAIN RESULTS: In patients on the 100-mg rt-PA regimen, major and minor hemorrhagic events were more common among those assigned to the invasive than among those assigned to the conservative strategy (18.5% versus 12.8%, P less than 0.001). Major or minor hemorrhagic events were associated with the extent of fibrinogen breakdown, peak rt-PA levels, thrombocytopenia, prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to more than 90 seconds, weight of 70 kg or less, female gender, and physical signs of cardiac decompensation. Immediate intravenous beta-blocker therapy had no important effect on hemorrhagic events when compared with delayed beta-blocker therapy. Intracranial hemorrhages were more frequent among patients treated with the 150-mg rt-PA dose than with the 100-mg rt-PA dose (2.1% versus 0.5%, P less than 0.001). The extent of the plasmin-mediated hemostatic defect was also greater in patients receiving the 150-mg dose. CONCLUSIONS: Increased morbidity due to hemorrhagic complications is associated with an invasive management strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Our findings show the complex interaction of several factors in the occurrence of hemorrhagic events during thrombolytic therapy. \nTreatment of unresectable meningiomas with the antiprogesterone agent mifepristone. The possibility that meningioma growth may be related to female sex hormone levels is suggested by several lines of evidence. Meningiomas are twice as common in women as in men, have been observed to wax and wane with pregnancy, and are positively associated with breast cancer. A physiological explanation for these phenomena is provided by the finding of steroid hormone receptors in meningiomas. However, unlike breast cancer, meningiomas are much more commonly positive for progesterone receptors than for estrogen receptors. The authors initiated a study on long-term oral therapy of unresectable meningiomas with the antiprogesterone mifepristone (RU486). Fourteen patients received mifepristone in daily doses of 200 mg for periods ranging from 2 to 31+ months (greater than or equal to 6 months in 12 patients). Five patients have shown signs of objective response (reduced tumor measurement on computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance image, or improved visual field examination). Three have also experienced subjective improvement (improved extraocular muscle function or relief from headache). The side effects of long-term mifepristone therapy have been mild. Fatigue was noted in 11 of the 14 patients. Other side effects included hot flashes in five patients, gynecomastia in three, partial alopecia in two, and cessation of menses in two. Long-term therapy with mifepristone is a new therapeutic option that may have efficacy in cases of unresectable benign meningioma. \nTransscleral leiomyoma. A bluish-pink epibulbar lesion, which slowly enlarged over a period of 5 years, developed in a 31-year-old woman. The lesion initially resembled a staphyloma, based on the very thinned overlying sclera, but subsequent evaluation suggested that it was a solid mass. At the time of surgical removal, the mass appeared to have originated in the supraciliary region and to have eroded outward through the sclera. Histopathologically, the mass proved to be a leiomyoma. The authors propose theoretic possibilities to explain the location of this rare type of ocular smooth muscle tumor. \nDetection of intraoperative laser injury to the facial nerve by electromyographic monitoring of facial muscles. Injury to the facial nerve is a significant risk during resection of cerebellopontine angle tumors. To minimize the risk of facial nerve injury, intraoperative electromyographic monitoring of facial musculature is frequently used. However, the reliability of such monitoring systems for detection of thermal nerve injury resulting from the use of carbon dioxide lasers has not been systematically evaluated. We determined the sensitivity of a computerized electromyographic monitor for detection of laser facial nerve injury in an anesthetized rat model. The mandibular and buccal branches of the facial nerve were isolated in 12 rats. A carbon dioxide laser was used to create controlled sites of thermal injury to both nerves over a 3-hour period. When a laser injury was created distal to previous injury sites, electromyographic discharge was noted in 72% to 82% of injuries. Laser injury proximal to previous injury sites was detected with 33% efficiency. These detection rates did not change significantly over a 3-hour period. This preliminary data suggests that electromyographic monitoring of facial musculature allows detection of facial nerve injury caused by carbon dioxide lasers. \nMorphologic comparison of frequency and types of acute lesions in the major epicardial coronary arteries in unstable angina pectoris, sudden coronary death and acute myocardial infarction. The frequency and type of acute lesions in the four major (right, left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex) epicardial coronary arteries were examined at necropsy in 14 patients with unstable angina pectoris, 21 patients with sudden coronary death and 32 patients with a fatal first acute myocardial infarction. None of the 67 patients had a grossly visible left ventricular scar (healed myocardial infarct) and only the group with acute myocardial infarction had left ventricular myocardial necrosis. Although the frequency of intraluminal thrombus was similar in patients with unstable angina (29%) and sudden death (29%) and significantly lower than in those with acute infarction (69%) (p = 0.02), the thrombus in the patients with unstable angina and sudden death consisted almost entirely of platelets and was nonocclusive, whereas the thrombus in the group with acute infarction consisted almost entirely of fibrin and was occlusive. The frequency of plaque rupture was insignificantly different in the groups with unstable angina (36%) and sudden death (19%), and was significantly lower than in the group with acute infarction (75%) (p = 0.02). The frequency of plaque hemorrhage was insignificantly different in the groups with unstable angina (64%) and sudden death (38%) and was significantly lower than in the group with acute infarction (90%) (p = 0.04). \nAdrenal hemangioma: an unusual adrenal mass delineated with magnetic resonance imaging. Adrenal hemangioma should be included in the differential diagnosis of any large calcified adrenal mass. We report to our knowledge the eighth surgically removed lesion and describe its appearance on magnetic resonance imaging. This imaging includes features seen in hemangiomas elsewhere, in particular a heterogeneous mass with enhancing peripheral high intensity foci on T1 images. \nA modified technique of pre-operative aortography to demonstrate the complete arterial tree of the lower limb. One hundred consecutive aortograms were studied to establish the efficacy of conventional arteriography in demonstrating distal vessels and the pedal arch. The standard technique was modified by using a long injection time, a large volume of contrast material (iopamidol 370), prolonged filming and multiple exposures of the feet. On the basis of these examinations each limb was classified as having aorto-iliac disease (18 limbs), superficial femoral disease (103 limbs), combined segment disease (28 limbs) or generalised disease (51 limbs). Calf and ankle arteries were seen in 196 of the 200 limbs (98%). Patency of the pedal arch was established in 184 (92%). Fourteen percent of the group of patients with combined segment disease did not have their pedal arch visualised and this group contained most of the examination failures. This modified method of aortography can demonstrate the entire arterial tree from the aorta to the foot in 92% of limbs with symptomatic chronic atherosclerotic disease. This allows the majority of peripheral vascular reconstructions to be planned and performed without the need for intra-operative arteriography. \nHyperbaric treatment of cerebral air embolism sustained during an open-heart surgical procedure A case of cerebral air embolism sustained during replacement of the mitral valve resulted in postoperative coma and seizures. Hyperbaric treatment, begun 30 hours after the occurrence of the air embolism, resulted in good immediate and long-term recovery. Mild deficits of the left hemisphere were present at follow-up 53 days after the embolus was sustained, and lesser, minimal residua were present at 14-month follow-up. Hyperbaric treatment is the definitive therapy for cerebral air embolism. Although it is most effective when administered early, the outcome may be excellent even with late treatment. \nGrowth of human basal cell carcinomas transplanted to C57/Balb/C bgJ/bgJ nu/nu (beige-nude) mice. The purpose of this study was to measure growth parameters of transplanted basal cell carcinoma (BCC) to beige-nude mice during a 4-month observation time. Forty male beige-nude mice were transplanted with human BCC with our reported subcutaneous implantation technique. Initial volume and wet weight were determined for each tumor. The tumors were measured every 2 weeks by calipers with a final volume determined at 120 days, at which time the tumors were harvested, weighed, and processed for routine histology. Thirty-two tumor sites were positive for persistent tumor at harvest. Tumor volumes declined by an average of 51% and average tumor weight by 33%. There were increased numbers of mast cells surrounding the BCC tumor lobules. These results indicate that BCC can survive for 120 days in the beige-nude mouse. \nCarbon dioxide laser energy disperses human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid onto treatment fields. The possibility of dispersing viral deoxyribonucleic acid during carbon dioxide laser treatment of human papillomavirus-containing genital infections has been investigated with a commercially available dot blot hybridization technique. The viral ribonucleic acid probes were specific for groups of human papillomavirus types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35. Laser energy was delivered by continuous-wave mode and the plume of smoke was evacuated by a vacuum suction system. Samples were taken with Dacron swabs from lesional tissues of 43 patients as well as from the treated areas and from the 5 cm surrounding normal skin before and after laser vaporization. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was identified in swabs from 34 of 43 (79%) lesional tissues and 7 of 43 (16%) treatment fields. Although a trend for higher human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid positivity in laser margins after therapy (7/43, 16%) than before (4/43, 9%) was observed, the rates were not statistically significant. It is concluded that carbon dioxide laser energy disperses human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid onto treatment fields and the adjacent normal epithelium. Viral contamination of treated areas may be reduced by positioning the fume evacuator within 1 cm of the field of laser vaporization and cleaning the treated areas and surrounding tissue after therapy. \nBouveret's syndrome: an unusual twist on the classic cause. Bouveret's syndrome is a duodenal obstruction caused by a gallstone, manifested mostly as a gastric outlet obstruction. We have reported an instance of Bouveret's syndrome caused by two separate stones, either of which could independently have caused the obstruction. It is imperative to be sure that the obstruction is relieved before terminating the operative procedure. \nAngiographic management of retroperitoneal hemorrhage from renal angiomyolipoma in polycystic kidney disease. Angiographic management of bilateral angiomyolipomas complicated by hemorrhage in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is presented. The patient had mild stigmata of tuberous sclerosis, and a family history of tuberous sclerosis and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The radiographic features at diagnosis, and those present during and after embolization are described. Radiological criteria for diagnosis and successful control of bleeding with intra-arterial selective embolization are discussed. Radiographic features before, during and after embolization are exhibited. \nSpecificity of low dose fadrozole hydrochloride (CGS 16949A) as an aromatase inhibitor. CGS 16949A (fadrozole hydrochloride), a potent cytochrome P450-mediated steroidogenesis inhibitor, blocks aromatase at low doses, but other biosynthetic steps at higher concentrations. Recent studies demonstrated inhibition of C11-hydroxylase, corticosterone methyloxidase-II, and deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone conversion with this agent at some-what higher concentrations than those required for blockade of aromatase. Based upon phase I studies, we postulated that relatively selective inhibition of aromatase might be possible if sufficiently low doses of CGS 16949A were used. A phase II study in 54 postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer examined the effects of low dose CGS 16949A on estrogen, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid secretion. Two dose schedules and two dose levels were chosen based upon our prior dose escalation protocol study. Plasma estrone, estradiol, and estrone sulfate as well as urinary estrone and estradiol fell equally with 1.8-4 mg CGS 16949A given either on a twice daily or three times daily dose schedule. Isotopic kinetic studies demonstrated an 84% decrease in the rate of conversion of androstenedione to estrone to 0.40 +/- 0.07% (patients receiving 1.8-4 mg CGS 16949A daily). With these three regimens, basal levels of aldosterone and cortisol did not change significantly over a 12-week period of observation. Clinical examination, plasma electrolytes, and urinary sodium/potassium ratios suggested no biological evidence of mineralo-corticoid deficiency. ACTH-stimulated cortisol concentrations, however, were blunted at each dose level compared to pretreatment values. Nonetheless, peak responses exceeded 550 nmol/L, or a basal to peak difference of 190 nmol/L or greater, in 97% of instances. This probably reflected inhibition of C11-hydroxylase, since basal and ACTH-stimulated levels of 11-deoxycortisol were increased in response to CGS 16949A. Androstenedione and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone also exhibited an upward trend in response to drug treatment. ACTH-stimulated aldosterone levels were blunted to a greater extent than those of cortisol, probably as a reflection of corticosterone methyloxidase type II blockade. Overall, the results suggest that CGS 16949A, at doses of 1.8-2 mg daily, blocks aromatase effectively and does not produce clinically important inhibition of cortisol or aldosterone biosynthesis. Thus, this agent can probably be used safely without glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid supplementation. \nIsolated neurofibromas of the conjunctiva. We studied four histologically verified cases of isolated neurofibromas of the conjunctiva. The histologic pattern was diffuse in two patients, plexiform in one patient, and solitary in one patient. Simple excision was curative in all cases. We emphasize the importance of distinguishing neuromas (which may be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia) from neurofibromas. \nDouble anal canal: complication of rectal fecalith. Fecaliths and stercoraceous ulcerations are well-known complications of chronic constipation. The authors present the case of a double anal canal in an elderly man. This anorectal fistula (complex anal fistula) developed as a complication of an impacted rectal fecalith with resultant stercoraceous ulceration. Eventually, a persistent epithelialized canal developed and was demonstrated at double-contrast barium enema examination. The patient remained continent at all times. \nVegetative state after closed-head injury. A Traumatic Coma Data Bank Report. To elucidate the clinical course of the vegetative state after severe closed-head injury, the Traumatic Coma Data Bank was analyzed for outcome at the time of discharge from the hospital and after follow-up intervals ranging up to 3 years after injury. Of 650 patients with closed-head injury available for analysis, 93 (14%) were discharged in a vegetative state. In comparison with conscious survivors, patients in a vegetative state sustained more severe closed-head injury as reflected by the Glasgow Coma Scale scores and pupillary findings and more frequently had diffuse injury complicated by swelling or shift in midline structures. Of 84 patients in a vegetative state who provided follow-up data, 41% became conscious by 6 months, 52% regained consciousness by 1 year, and 58% recovered consciousness within the 3-year follow-up interval. A logistic regression failed to identify predictors of recovery from the vegetative state. \nSimilar outcome of treatment of B-cell and T-cell diffuse large-cell lymphomas: the Stanford experience. Although previous studies have suggested a relatively poor prognosis for some patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, the clinical significance of immunologic phenotype in diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) remains controversial. One hundred one patients with a uniform morphologic diagnosis of DLCL treated at Stanford between 1975 and 1986 with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), methotrexate, bleomycin, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone ([M]BACOD), or methotrexate, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (MACOP-B) chemotherapy were studied with regard to immunologic phenotype. Immunologic analysis, performed on frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue, identified 77 cases of B-cell origin, 21 cases of T-cell origin, and three cases that lacked B-cell or T-cell markers. Analysis of complete remission (CR) rates (84% v 95%), 5-year actuarial freedom from disease progression (38% v 53%), and 5-year actuarial overall survival (52% v 79%) showed no statistically significant differences in prognosis between B- and T-cell patients, respectively. The 5-year actuarial survival of patients with stage IV T-cell DLCL (56%) also did not differ in a statistically significant way from stage IV B-cell patients (36%). We conclude that treatment selection for DLCL should not be based on immunologic phenotype alone. \nLong survival after excision of a primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus. A woman who had a large primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus, with evidence of submucosal invasion and several local metastases, underwent resection two years after the onset of retrosternal pain and has survived for 12 years with no recurrence. \nBeta-adrenergic-antagonist drugs in the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices. An analysis of data and prognostic factors in 589 patients from four randomized clinical trials. Franco-Italian Multicenter Study Group. BACKGROUND. The value of beta-adrenergic-antagonist drug therapy for the prevention of initial episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices is uncertain, both positive and negative study results having been reported. METHODS. In this study, we analyzed data on individual patients from four randomized, controlled trials to assess the efficacy of this treatment. Of the 589 patients studied, 286 received a beta-adrenergic-antagonist drug (propranolol in 203 and nadolol in 83) and 303 received placebo. RESULTS. After two years, the mean (+/- SE) percentage of patients who had had no upper gastrointestinal bleeding was 78 +/- 3 percent in the beta-adrenergic-antagonist treatment group and 65 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.002). The percentage of patients without fatal bleeding was 90 +/- 2 percent in the treatment group and 82 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.01). The percentage of patients surviving after two years was 71 +/- 3 percent in the treatment group and 68 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.34). After age and severity of cirrhosis were taken into account, the survival rate was better in the treatment group (P = 0.09). The percentage of surviving patients who had had no bleeding after two years was 62 +/- 3 percent in the treatment group and 53 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.04). Both propranolol and nadolol prevented a first episode of bleeding. Severe cirrhosis and especially the presence of ascites were associated with bleeding (P less than 0.001) and death (P less than 0.001) in both groups. The efficacy of beta-adrenergic-antagonist therapy in the prevention of bleeding (P less than 0.001) and of fatal bleeding (P = 0.004) and in the prevention of bleeding or death (P = 0.005) was the same after adjustment for cause and severity of cirrhosis, ascites, and size of varices. CONCLUSIONS. Propranolol and nadolol are effective in preventing first bleeding and reducing the mortality rate associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, regardless of severity. \nGlomerulopathy in patient with Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate renal structure in a child with Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism), who at 10 yr of age was noted to have hypertension, microalbuminuria, and enlarged kidneys, a renal biopsy was performed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The renal biopsy tissue was evaluated by light and electron microscopy with standard stereological techniques to measure glomerular volume, glomerular basement membrane width, fractional mesangial volume, and peripheral capillary filtering surface density. RESULTS: On renal biopsy, there was a marked increase in glomerular volume, glomerular basement width, and mesangial volume, findings similar to those seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: This patient with marked insulin resistance associated with Donohue syndrome demonstrates renal and glomerular enlargement and morphometric glomerular changes similar to those seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. In unusual syndromes with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, renal structural and functional changes typical of traditional diabetes mellitus may be seen. \nThe measurement and manipulation of intralabyrinthine pressure in experimental endolymphatic hydrops. Three to four months after unilateral surgical ablation of the endolymphatic duct and sac, endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressures were measured in both the normal and hydropic ears of 11 guinea pigs. In normal ears, endolymphatic pressure always approximated perilymphatic pressure. Endolymphatic pressure exceeded perilymphatic pressure in all ears with hydrops, except one in which these pressures were equal. The effect of postural inversion on inner ear pressures were studied in both normal and hydropic inner ears. Normal ears showed endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressure to rise equally during this maneuver. In hydropic ears, the difference between endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressure was notably reduced from measurements obtained in the prone position. This study indicates that an alteration in pressure regulation within the inner ear may be important in the pathogenesis and manifestation of experimental endolymphatic hydrops in the guinea pig. Physiologic mechanisms and clinical implications of these results are described. \nProsthetic replacement of the distal femur for primary bone tumours. Over a 16-year period, 135 custom-made distal femoral prostheses, based on a fully constrained Stanmore-type knee replacement, were used in the treatment of primary malignant or aggressive benign tumours. Survivorship analysis showed a cumulative success rate of 72% at five years and 64% at seven years. Intact prostheses in 91% of the surviving patients gave good or excellent functional results. Deep infection was the major complication, occurring in 6.8% of cases; clinical aseptic loosening occurred in 6.0%. Revision surgery was carried out for loosening and infection, and the early results are encouraging. We conclude that prosthetic replacement of the distal femur can meet the objectives of limb salvage surgery. \nThe neurology of endemic cretinism. A study of two endemias. Endemic cretinism is the most severe manifestation of dietary iodine deficiency. Two forms of the syndrome are traditionally described: neurological and myxoedematous. Although this classification highlights the important neurological sequelae of the disorder it implies that myxoedematous cretins have an alternative mechanism. Further, the nature of the neurological deficit associated with both types of endemic cretinism has received scant attention in recent times considering that it remains a common disorder in many parts of the world. The nature and extent of the neurological deficit found in endemic cretinism was investigated in 104 cretins from a predominantly myxoedematous endemia in western China and in 35 cretins from central Java, Indonesia, a predominantly neurological endemia. We found a similar pattern of neurological involvement in nearly all cretins from both endemias, regardless of type (myxoedematous or neurological), and of current thyroid function. Hallmarks of the neurological features included mental retardation, pyramidal signs in a proximal distribution and extrapyramidal signs. Many patients exhibited a characteristic gait. This probably reflected pyramidal and extrapyramidal dysfunction, although joint laxity and deformity were important contributing factors. Other frequently encountered clinical features were squint, deafness, and primitive reflexes. Cerebral computerized tomography (CT) revealed basal ganglia calcification in 15 of 50 subjects. The presence of basal ganglia calcification was confined to cretins with severe hypothyroidism. Otherwise, cerebral CT scanning demonstrated only minor abnormalities which did not contribute to the localization of the clinical deficits. We conclude that the same neurological disorder is present in both types of endemic cretinism reflecting a diffuse insult to the developing fetal nervous system. These clinical findings support the concept of maternal and fetal hypothyroxinaemia, arising from severe iodine deficiency, as the primary pathophysiological event in endemic cretinism. Differences between the two types of cretinism may be explained by continuing postnatal thyroid hormone deficiency in the myxoedematous type, which results in impaired growth, skeletal retardation and sexual immaturity. \nPulmonary vein thrombosis following bilobectomy. Acute thrombosis of the pulmonary vein following lobectomy or bilobectomy is a rare complication with no standard guideline for diagnosis or management. In this report, we present a case of right upper lobe vein thrombosis following a middle and lower lobectomy. Diagnosis was confirmed by ventilation-perfusion lung scan, pulmonary angiogram, and bronchoscopy. The patient was treated conservatively with no further complications and had a partial recovery of the circulation to the right upper lobe. A review of the literature is also presented along with the experimental data demonstrating the mechanisms of recovery. \nAtypical squamous cells. A case-series study of the association between papanicolaou smear results and human papillomavirus DNA genotype. Thirty women with \"atypical\" squamous cells but not cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) on their Papanicolaou smears were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) with the Southern blot hybridization technique. The Papanicolaou smears were reviewed for the presence of atypical squamous cells according to Patten's criteria. Comparison groups consisted of 30 patients with normal, 29 patients with CIN I and 24 patients with CIN II Papanicolaou smears. Ten of the 30 women (33%) with atypical cells on Papanicolaou smears were positive for HPV DNA as compared to 17% with normal and 59% with CIN I or II Papanicolaou smears. HPV 16 was present in 70-80% of the HPV DNA-positive patients in each Papanicolaou smear group. Concurrent CIN was also identified on colposcopically directed biopsies in 27% of the patients with squamous atypia. Patients with atypical squamous cells on Papanicolaou smears had coexisting HPV infection and CIN in about one-third of the cases. Colposcopy and further follow-up are recommended for such patients. \nInjury current and gradients of diastolic stimulation threshold, TQ potential, and extracellular potassium concentration during acute regional ischemia in the isolated perfused pig heart. During acute regional myocardial ischemia, a \"current of injury\" flows between the ischemic and the normal tissue. Its direction and magnitude change during the cardiac cycle. During diastole, the injury current flows intracellularly from the ischemic cells toward the normal cells and tends to depolarize the latter. The gain insight into the possible role of the injury current in arrhythmogenesis, we simultaneously determined diastolic stimulation threshold, [K+]o and TQ potential at multiple sites closely spaced across the cyanotic border in Langendorff-perfused pig hearts during the first 10 minutes after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The position of the electrodes relative to the border was validated by their response to 1) regional ischemia and 2) selective perfusion with a high-K+ perfusate of the left anterior descending coronary artery. A temporary decrease of diastolic stimulation threshold preceded a rapid increase in the central ischemic zone; a lasting reduction (by +/- 20%) without a concomitant increase of [K+]o was observed at seven sites (of 39 sites tested), five of which were less than 2 mm outside the electrophysiological border. Moreover, up to 4 mm inside the electrophysiological border, a similar lasting decrease of diastolic stimulation threshold was accompanied by a moderate increase of [K+]o. We conclude that 1) the injury current causes increased excitability in normal tissue close to the \"ischemic\" border and 2) increased excitability related to a moderately increased [K+]o may persist up to 10 minutes of ischemia at the ischemic side of the border. Both factors may facilitate the induction of life-threatening arrhythmias in acute myocardial ischemia. \nIntraoperative facial nerve monitoring: prognostic aspects during acoustic tumor removal. Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring with electrical stimulation (IFNMES) has become an integral part of acoustic tumor surgery. We reviewed the records of fifty-six patients who underwent translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removal with IFNMES. There was excellent correlation between intraoperative facial nerve activity and immediate postoperative facial nerve function (24 hours after surgery and at hospital discharge). Our data would suggest that patients who exhibit less than 500 microvolts of ongoing EMG activity during surgery, and who yield at least a 500-microvolt contraction when stimulated with 0.05 milliamps at the brainstem after tumor removal, can expect an excellent immediate facial nerve result (grade I or II). \nDiskitis in children. Thirty-six patients diagnosed with diskitis from 1978 to 1988 and followed for an average of 29.2 months were reviewed. The study included 23 boys and 13 girls with an average age of 5.3 years. The initial symptoms varied, but distinct clinical patterns emerged and were identifiable in different age groups. Both the leukocyte count and sedimentation rate were elevated. Routine roentgenograms were positive for intervertebral disk space narrowing in 82% of cases, technetium bone scans positive in 72%, and magnetic resonance imaging positive in all recent cases. Treatment consisted of bed rest for all patients, plaster casts for 50%, antibiotics for 40%, and traction for 23%. Regardless of the treatment combination, the course of the disease in most children is benign. At the completion of the study, all patients were asymptomatic including three children who had recurrences. In spite of being asymptomatic, 74% had persistent roentgenographic changes. The administration of antibiotics appears to be appropriate when indicated, i.e., failure to respond to immobilization. Disk space aspiration or biopsy should be reserved for those cases that are refractory to immobilization and antibiotics. \nThe autotransfusion effect of external leg counterpressure in simulated mild hypovolemia. We examined the cardiovascular response of external leg counterpressure in healthy volunteers at 100 mm Hg compression pressure. To stimulate mild hypovolemia, measurements were made with the subjects in a 60 degrees head-up tilt position. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and cardiac output (CO) were calculated from two-dimensional echocardiography. Flow through the inferior vena cava (IVC) below the origin of the hepatic veins was determined by the Doppler ultrasound technique. The application of counterpressure significantly increased LVEDV, CO, and arterial blood pressure over that seen with tilting without the device. These responses were accompanied by a small but significant increase in IVC flow. We therefore concluded that external leg counterpressure transferred blood to the central circulation by compression of the venous capacitance vessels (an autotransfusion effect) in mild hypovolemia, but such an effect may not benefit patients in a hypovolemic shock state because of the small amount of translocated blood. \nCardiovascular reflexes and autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Cardiovascular reflexes were analysed in a group of 20 patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and in 12 age-matched healthy subjects, in order to ascertain the incidence and degree of autonomic dysfunction. The following were measured: heart rate variation during normal breathing, postural change (30/15 ratio) and during the Valsalva manoeuvre: blood pressure variation after standing. These measurements were taken at least 12 h after therapy had been withdrawn and were repeated after therapy had been resumed. Significant changes in the different heart rate variation indices were found in the parkinsonian patients which correlated with the duration and severity of the extrapyramidal symptomatology. After standing the patients showed a significant drop in blood pressure, when compared respectively with their base values and with the response in controls. Anticholinergic drugs had no significant effect on the heart rate variation indices, whereas antiparkinsonian therapy seems to have contributed to the drop in blood pressure after standing. \nDysfibrinogenemia associated with thrombosis and third-trimester fetal loss. A case report. Dysfibrinogenemias are rare genetic disorders that are clinically silent, cause a mild bleeding tendency or have thromboembolic manifestations. During pregnancy they often cause hemorrhage and first-trimester abortions. A patient with a severe thrombotic tendency during pregnancy had a third-trimester fetal loss. \nComparative effects of APSAC and rt-PA on infarct size and left ventricular function in acute myocardial infarction. A multicenter randomized study. BACKGROUND. Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA or alteplase) and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC or anistreplase) have been demonstrated to limit infarct size significantly and to preserve left ventricular function when injected soon after acute myocardial infarction. However, as yet, the efficacy and safety of these two thrombolytic agents have not been directly compared in one trial; this was the aim of this study. METHODS AND RESULTS. One hundred eighty-three patients suffering from a first acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated to either APSAC (30 units over 5 minutes) or single-chain rt-PA (100 mg over a 3-hour period) within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms. Global and regional left ventricular function were assessed from contrast angiography an average of 5.3 +/- 2.3 days after initial therapy. Radionuclide angiography and thallium-201 single-photon emission computerized tomography were performed before hospital discharge. Infarct size was assessed by single-photon emission computerized tomography and expressed in percentage of the total myocardial volume. Ninety patients received APSAC and 93 received rt-PA within a mean period of 172 +/- 52 minutes after the onset of symptoms. The two groups were similar in age, location of the acute myocardial infarction, Killip class, and time of randomization. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery was 72% in the APSAC group and 76% in the rt-PA group (NS). Initial and predischarge left ventricular ejection fraction as well as infarct size were similar in both therapeutic groups (0.50 +/- 0.14 versus 0.52 +/- 0.12 for initial and 0.48 +/- 0.10 versus 0.47 +/- 0.10 for predischarge ejection fraction, 11 +/- 7% versus 9 +/- 7% for infarct size, respectively, for APSAC- and rt-PA-treated patients). Bleeding complications requiring blood transfusion occurred in one APSAC patient and in two rt-PA patients. One patient in the rt-PA group died of a massive intracranial hemorrhage. At the end of the 3-week follow-up period, five APSAC patients (5.5%) and seven rt-PA patients (7.5%) had died. CONCLUSIONS. The early infusion of APSAC or rt-PA in acute myocardial infarction produced a similar patency rate, limitation of infarct size, and preservation of left ventricular systolic function with an equivalent rate of bleeding complications. \nDetection of field change in oral cancer using oral exfoliative cytologic study. Four smears were taken from the normal buccal mucosa of 55 oral cancer patients and 76 cancer-free patients. In each case, two were stained by the Papanicolaou method and two underwent Feulgen hydrolysis. Quantitative assessment of nuclear area (NA) and cytoplasmic area (CA) of the Papanicolaou smears was undertaken using a semiautomatic image analysis system. DNA profiles were assessed from the Feulgen smears using a Vickers M85 microdensitometer (Vickers Instruments, York, England) and were found to be diploid for all patients. Results were then analyzed with respect to those patients who took alcohol, tobacco, combination of alcohol and tobacco, and those who took neither. A significant reduction in CA for the oral cancer group (P equals 0.001) but no change in NA (P equals 0.74) was observed. A detailed analysis of alcohol and tobacco habits could identify no significant role for these two factors, in the reduction in cytoplasmic area. Such field change may prove to be of value in predicting the development of second malignant tumors. \nFever: knowledge, perception and attitudes. Results from a Norwegian population study. To investigate the layman's knowledge, perception and attitudes regarding normal body temperature, fever, infections and the effect of penicillin on virus infections a representative sample of the Norwegian population (619 women and 592 men over the age of 15) was interviewed in 1988 as part of a monthly national opinion poll. One-third thought body temperatures up to 40.5 degrees C to be life-threatening, but the results do not justify the application of the term 'fever phobia' as described in other studies based on non-representative samples. More respondents were afraid of viral infections (48%) than bacterial infections (9%), which may be due to the media focus upon the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Thirty-five per cent believed penicillin to be effective against virus infections. Educational programmes on fever should also include information about virus infections and their treatment. \nAssessment of response to cancer therapy using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography. In order to evaluate the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET in the assessment of therapeutic effects, FDG-PET studies were performed both before and after therapy in 26 patients with miscellaneous malignant tumors. The change in FDG uptake by therapy was compared with the change in tumor size and prognosis. All 26 lesions had a high FDG uptake before therapy. Five of seven lesions which had a relatively low FDG uptake before therapy showed no change or increase in tumor size by therapy. The decreased FDG uptake after therapy was more prominent in the partial response group than in the no change group. FDG uptake before therapy in the non-relapse group was higher than that in the relapse group. However, a decreased FDG uptake did not necessarily indicate a good prognosis. One patient with no change in tumor size and a decreased FDG uptake had no recurrence. This suggests that FDG-PET has a complementary role in the assessment of therapeutic effects. \nSubarachnoid hemorrhage from multiple neurofibromas of the cauda equina: case report. The authors report a case of spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by neurofibromas of the cauda equina. An examination of the literature revealing 13 similar cases and an analysis of this case showing three neurofibromas of the cauda equina prompted an hypothesis emphasizing the origin of bleeding and the difficulties associated with a correct diagnosis. \nDifferential effect of compression-ischaemia block on warm sensation and heat-induced pain. The effect of compression-ischaemia nerve block on psychophysical thresholds for warm sensation and heat-induced pain was studied on 19 normal human volunteers. Although those two sensory submodalities should be predicted to block simultaneously, based on the fact that both are served by unmyelinated primary afferents, it was actually found that warm sensation was much more vulnerable to compression-ischaemia than heat-induced pain. This is interpreted as resulting from different summation requirements for each of the two sensory modalities; sensation of warmth depends on spatial summation to a larger extent than heat-induced pain. Such differential vulnerability is in line with recent clinical studies reporting deterioration of warm sensation associated with preservation of heat pain in peripheral nerve disorders caused by diabetes, ageing and other neuropathic processes. \nAcoustic schwannomas in children. The clinical presentation and treatment of three cases of acoustic schwannoma occurring in children are described. All the tumors were detected late, when they had attained a large size and were extremely vascular. The use of preoperative tumor embolization as an adjunct to surgical excision is discussed. \nHepatofugal arterial signal in the main portal vein: an indicator of intravascular tumor spread. Five patients with thrombosis of the main portal vein underwent Doppler ultrasound (US). Three of these patients had confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma. Doppler US allowed differentiation between bland thrombus and tumor thrombus in two of the three patients. Tumor thrombus of the main portal vein was characterized at US by an intraportal arterial waveform in a hepatofugal direction. \nDifferentiation of hydrocephalic calf and human calvariae. Occasionally, partial calvariae of hydrocephalic calves are found in forensic contexts and mistakenly identified as human. Such specimens can be properly identified through immunological assessment of associated soft tissue, microscopic analysis of associated hair, and morphological comparison with documented museum specimens. Morphological comparison should focus on the form of the occiput, supraorbital grooves, and bulbous vault and presence of coronal processes. \nRisk factors for infusion-related phlebitis with small peripheral venous catheters. A randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for infusion-related phlebitis with peripheral intravenous catheters. DESIGN: A randomized trial of two catheter materials, with consideration of 21 potential risk factors. SETTING: A university hospital. PATIENTS: Hospitalized adults without granulocytopenia who received a peripheral intravenous catheter. INTERVENTIONS: House officers or ward nurses inserted the catheters, and each insertion was randomized to a catheter made of tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene (FEP-Teflon) or a novel polyetherurethane without leachable additives (PEU-Vialon). MEASUREMENTS: Research nurses scored insertion sites each day for inflammation and cultured catheters at removal. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier risk for phlebitis exceeded 50% by day 4 after catheterization. intravenous antibiotics (relative risk, 2.00), female sex (relative risk, 1.88), prolonged (greater than 48 hours) catheterization (relative risk, 1.79), and catheter material (PEU-Vialon: FEP-Teflon) (relative risk, 0.73) strongly predicted phlebitis in a Cox proportional hazards model (each, P less than 0.003). The best-fit model for severe phlebitis identified the same predictors plus catheter-related infection (relative risk, 6.19), phlebitis with a previous catheter (relative risk, 1.54), and anatomic site (hand: forearm, relative risk, 0.71; wrist:forearm, relative risk, 0.60). The low incidence of local catheter-related infection was comparable with the two catheter materials (5.4% [95% CI, 3.8% to 7.6%] and 6.9% [CI, 4.9% to 9.6%]); none of the 1054 catheters prospectively studied caused bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors, including the infusate and the duration of cannulation, contribute to the development of infusion-related phlebitis. The use of peripheral intravenous catheters made of PEU-Vialon appears to pose the same risk for catheter-related infection as the use of catheters made of FEP-Teflon, and PEU-Vialon can permit longer cannulation with less risk for phlebitis. The risk for catheter-related bacteremia with FEP-Teflon and PEU-Vialon catheters is sufficiently low that it no longer seems justifiable to recommend the use of small steel needles for most peripheral intravenous therapy. \nSurgical depilation for the treatment of pseudofolliculitis or local hirsutism of the face: experience in the first 40 patients. Forty patients underwent surgical depilation for pseudofolliculitis barbae or local hirsutism of the face during a 15-year period. The operative method and its results and pitfalls are discussed. Although it is not the treatment of choice, this operation is very useful when other therapy has not been successful. This seems especially true in male-to-female transsexuals. \nMuscle structure and performance capacity of Himalayan Sherpas. The ultrastructure of the vastus lateralis muscle of Sherpas from Nepal [5 males; age 28 +/- 2.8 (SD) yr, indirect maximal O2 consumption 48.5 +/- 5.4 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)] was assessed and compared with those of sedentary lowlanders and of Caucasian climbers before and after high-altitude exposure. The mean cross-sectional area of the fibers was 3,186 +/- 521 microns2, i.e., similar to those of Caucasian elite high-altitude climbers (3,108 +/- 303 microns2) and a group of climbers after a 6- to 8-wk sojourn at 5,000-8,600 m (3,360 +/- 580 microns2) but significantly (P less than 0.05) smaller than that of unacclimatized climbers (4,170 +/- 710 microns2) and slightly, although not significantly, lower than that of sedentary lowlanders (3,640 +/- 260 microns2). The number of capillaries per square millimeter of muscle cross section was 467 +/- 22, not significantly smaller than those of climbers on return from a Himalayan expedition (538 +/- 89) and elite high-altitude climbers (542 +/- 127) but significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than that of sedentary lowlanders (387 +/- 25). The volume density of mitochondria was 3.96 +/- 0.54%, significantly (P less than 0.05) less than the values found for any other investigated group, including sedentary subjects at sea level (4.74 +/- 0.30%). It is concluded that Sherpas, like acclimatized Caucasian climbers, are characterized by 1) facilitated convective and diffusive muscle O2 flow conditions and 2) a higher maximal O2 consumption-to-mitochondrial volume ratio than lowlanders despite a reduced mitochondrial volume density. \nTest-retest reliability of isokinetic knee extension and flexion torque measurements in persons with spastic hemiparesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the test-retest reliability of isokinetic torque measurements in the involved and uninvolved knee musculature of 20 subjects with spastic hemiparesis. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure maximal voluntary knee extension and flexion at 60 degrees and 120 degrees/s. Peak torque (PT) and average peak torque (APT) data were collected from five repetitions on two separate occasions. Average peak torque was defined as the mean of the PT values obtained during each of the five repetitions. Spasticity was measured in the involved knee musculature prior to isokinetic testing using the Ashworth Scale.
