Numerous tumor cell lines of leukemic origin are known to modulate cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens resulting in alterations in their immune detection and tumorigenicity. We have been studying the mechanisms responsible for attenuation of MHC class I gene expression in an H-2 heterozygous (H-2b x H-2d) Abelson-Murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed leukemic cell line (designated R8). Here we report that treatment of the R8 cell line with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) increased H-2Kb steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) levels several fold. The induced H-2Kb mRNA transcripts were functional, as demonstrated by their ability to be translated into immunoprecipitable H-2Kb alloantigen. H-2Kb null variants derived from the R8 cell line were shown to be the product of both cis- and trans-acting mechanisms, insomuch as the treatment of R8-derived H-2Kb non-expressor lines with CHX re-established expression of H-2Kb mRNA to the same extent as transfection of the variant cell line with the wild-type H-2Kb gene. Such findings indicate that downregulation of MHC class I gene expression is constitutive for the R8 leukemic cell line, a phenomenon that may be related to the immature pre-B-cell phenotype of this A-MuLV transformant. \nSmoking cessation following admission to a coronary care unit. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of an episode of serious cardiovascular disease on smoking behavior and to identify factors associated with smoking cessation in this setting. DESIGN: Prospective observational study in which smokers admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU) were followed for one year after hospital discharge to determine subsequent smoking behavior. SETTING: Coronary care unit of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Preadmission smoking status was assessed in all 828 patients admitted to the CCU during one year. The 310 smokers surviving to hospital discharge were followed and their smoking behaviors assessed by self-report at six and 12 months. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Six months after discharge, 32% of survivors were not smoking; the rate of sustained cessation at one year was 25%. Smokers with a new diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) made during hospitalization had the highest cessation rate (53% vs. 31%, p = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, smoking cessation was more likely if patients were discharged with a diagnosis of CHD, had no prior history of CHD, were lighter smokers (less than 1 pack/day), and had congestive heart failure during hospitalization. Among smokers admitted because of suspected myocardial infarction (MI), cessation was more likely if the diagnosis was CHD than if it was noncoronary (37% vs. 19%, p less than 0.05), but a diagnosis of MI led to no more smoking cessation than did coronary insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization in a CCU is a stimulus to long-term smoking cessation, especially for lighter smokers and those with a new diagnosis of CHD. Admission to a CCU may represent a time when smoking habits are particularly susceptible to intervention. Smoking cessation in this setting should improve patient outcomes because cessation reduces cardiovascular mortality, even when quitting occurs after the onset of CHD. \nCerebral abnormalities in congenital myotonic dystrophy. The brain structure of 14 infants born with congenital myotonic dystrophy at 2 hospitals was evaluated by cranial ultrasonography, and the findings were correlated with clinical and neuropathologic data. Ventricular dilation was diagnosed in 11 infants (78%). Seven infants died during the neonatal period; all had ventricular dilation which remained essentially static. In the ultrasound scans of the 5 infants with ventricular dilation. Of the 7 survivors, 4 had ventricular dilation born at 1 hospital, 4 had widening of the interhemispheric fissure. Macrocephaly, a previously unrecognized finding in congenital myotonic dystrophy, was present in 10 infants (71%), 8 of whom presented with ventricular dilation. None had clinical evidence of increased intracranial pressure. There was no ventricular obstruction in the 4 brains examined pathologically. Histologic examination revealed minor expression of neuronal migrational disturbances in each patient. Macrocephaly together with the ultrasonographic and neuropathologic findings in our patients suggest that these abnormalities may originate in an external hydrocephalus. \nThe treatment of atypical lipoma with liposuction. Large lipomas may best be treated with liposuction. Once a lipoma enlarges to 4 cm or more, liposuction has several advantages over conventional surgery. A well-demarcated lipoma 15 cm in diameter and deep to muscle was treated by liposuction. Biopsy showed an atypical lipoma. Because the entire tumor was removed by liposuction, we feel that the prognosis is excellent. The cosmesis and morbidity results were far superior to those anticipated with conventional excisional surgery. Small superficial lipomas may be treated by suction lipectomy and the surrounding area can be contoured symmetrically at the same time, whereas large ones can be liposuctioned completely without extensive surgical extirpation and morbidity. Because such big lesions may represent atypical lipomas or liposarcomas, care must be taken to remove the entire tumor. \nCharacteristics of serial electrocardiograms in heart transplant recipients. To characterize \"normal electrocardiogram patterns\" after transplantation, serial surface 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) taken 2 weeks, 1 month, and 1 year postoperatively in a group of 50 heart transplant recipients were analyzed and were correlated with clinical parameters. Some recipient atrial activity was evident in 40% of patients at 2 weeks, but in only 16% at 1 year; donor atrial activity was normal in 90% to 94% of patients at all times. ECG intervals generally were normal and did not change over time. The most prevalent abnormality was the presence of incomplete (IRBBB) or complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) patterns (14% at 2 weeks, 16% at 1 month, and 22% at 1 year). In patients with hemodynamic measurements available approximately at the time of the ECG recording 1 year following transplantation, there was a significant correlation between the presence of IRBBB and RBBB patterns and somewhat higher levels of right atrial mean pressure (6.8 versus 3.9 mm Hg, p = 0.01), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (32.5 versus 24.5 mm Hg, p = 0.001) and diastolic pressure (16.2 versus 11.2 mm Hg, p = 0.004), and right ventricular systolic pressure (31.4 versus 26.9 mm Hg, p = 0.019) and pulmonary artery wedge mean pressure (11.3 versus 7.9 mm Hg, p = 0.010). Repolarization changes were also common but decreased in frequency over time (78% at 2 weeks to 34% at 1 year) and did not correlate with the presence or absence of rejection. We conclude that ECG abnormalities in heart transplant recipients are generally mild and that IRBBB and RBBB patterns correlate with increased right heart pressures. \nImportance of ulceration of carotid plaque in determining symptoms of cerebral ischemia. In order to investigate the relationship between carotid plaque morphology and symptoms of cerebral ischemia, a prospective clinicopathological study was performed. Ninety consecutive intact carotid plaques obtained from surgery and 43 carotid plaques from cadavers without symptoms of cerebral ischemia were evaluated. Ulceration and mural thrombus were the only morphologic findings statistically correlated to the presence of hemispheric symptoms (p less than 0.02). Intramural hemorrhage was more common in patients with hemispheric symptoms but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31). Plaque causing high degree stenosis had a higher incidence of intramural hemorrhage (p = 0.04) and ulceration (p less than 0.02). Ulceration of plaque plays a major role in the onset of hemispheric symptoms. The results of our study support the hypothesis that in the majority of the cases, hemispheric symptoms are embolic in nature. \nMyasthenia gravis. T epitopes on the delta subunit of human muscle acetylcholine receptor. Autoimmune T cell lines specific for muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were propagated from the blood of three myasthenia gravis patients by the use of a pool of synthetic peptides (delta-pool) corresponding to the complete sequence of the delta-subunit of human muscle AChR. Propagation of AChR-specific T cell lines was attempted unsuccessfully from four other myasthenia gravis patients and from four healthy controls. The lines had CD3+, CD4+, CD8- phenotype, strongly recognized the delta-pool, and cross-reacted vigorously with non-denatured AChR purified from mammalian muscle. They did not cross-react detectably with pools of similar overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the complete sequences of the alpha- and gamma-subunits of human muscle AChR. The sequence segments of the delta-subunit that contain T epitopes were identified by investigating the response of the three CD4+ T cell lines to the individual synthetic peptides forming the delta-pool. Each line had an individual pattern of peptide recognition. Although no immunodominant region, recognized in association with different DR haplotypes, could be identified, the sequence segments most strongly recognized by the CD4+ T cell lines were clustered within residues 121-290. One of the peptides more strongly recognized by the T cells corresponded to a sequence segment with high predicted propensity to form an amphipathic alpha-helix, a structural motif proposed to be typical of T epitopes. \nCell associated urokinase activity and colonic epithelial cells in health and disease. It is not known if urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is associated with normal colonic epithelial cells. The aims of this study were to determine if normal colonic epithelial cells have uPA activity and whether this is concentrated at the cell membrane. In addition, the contribution of colonic epithelial cell associated uPA activity to disease related pertubations of mucosal uPA activity were examined. A highly enriched population of colonic epithelial cells was isolated from resected colon or biopsy specimens by an enzymatic technique. uPA activity was measured in cell homogenates by a specific and sensitive colorimetric method and expressed relative to cellular DNA. In two experiments subcellular fractionation of colonic epithelial cells was performed by nitrogen cavitation followed by ultracentrifugation over a linear sucrose gradient. The fractions collected were analysed for uPA and organelle-specific enzyme activities. Normal colonic epithelial cells have cell associated uPA activity (mean (SEM) 5.6 (1.1) IU/mg, n = 18). This colocalised with fractions enriched for leucine-beta-naphthylamidase and 5'-nucleotidase, markers of plasma membrane. uPA activities in epithelial cells from cancerous colons (9.8 (3.1) n = 7) or from mucosa affected by inflammatory bowel disease (3.8 (0.7) n = 15) were not significantly different from normal (paired t test), while that in epithelial cells from greatly inflamed mucosa was similar to that from autologous normal or mildly inflamed areas (4.4 (1.2) v 5.9 (3.6), n = 9). Thus normal colonic epithelial cells have cell associated uPA activity which is concentrated on the plasma membranes, suggesting the presence of uPA receptors. \nRecurrent prolonged coma due to basilar artery migraine. A case report. A 25 year old patient presented with recurrent prolonged episodes of life-threatening coma varying from 3 to 10 days. The clinical recovery was slow. The history and technical examinations led to the diagnosis of basilar artery migraine (BAM). The etiology of the coma episodes is thought to be related to ischemic dysfunction of the rostral part of the brainstem due to severe spasm of the basilar artery demonstrated by arteriography. Exceptional are the recurrent prolonged coma episodes of sudden onset, the severe spasm of the basilar artery, and the suppression-burst and FIRDA pattern on the EEG examinations during the coma episodes. \nSex differences in the management of coronary artery disease. Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Investigators BACKGROUND. Despite the fact that coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death among women, previous studies have suggested that physicians are less likely to pursue an aggressive approach to coronary artery disease in women than in men. To define this issue further, we compared the care previously received by men and women who were enrolled in a large postinfarction intervention trial. METHODS. We assessed the nature and severity of anginal symptoms and the use of antianginal and antiischemic interventions before enrollment in the 1842 men and 389 women with left ventricular ejection fractions less than or equal to 40 percent after an acute myocardial infarction who were randomized in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement trial. RESULTS. Before their index infarction, women were as likely as men to have had angina and to have been treated with antianginal drugs. However, despite reports by women of symptoms consistent with greater functional disability from angina, fewer women had undergone cardiac catheterization (15.4 percent of women vs. 27.3 percent of men, P less than 0.001) or coronary bypass surgery (5.9 percent of women vs. 12.7 percent of men, P less than 0.001). When these differences were adjusted for important covariates, men were still twice as likely to undergo an invasive cardiac procedure as women, but bypass surgery was performed with equal frequency among the men and women who did undergo cardiac catheterization. CONCLUSIONS. Physicians pursue a less aggressive management approach to coronary disease in women than in men, despite greater cardiac disability in women. \nCranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. High resolution computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head with 3-mm sections through the circle of Willis was obtained in 96 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. These scans are well suited for the noninvasive, presymptomatic diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms at high risk of rupture, since the risk of rupture of unruptured aneurysms is heavily dependent on their size, and aneurysms equal to or larger than 6 mm in diameter are not likely to escape detection by these techniques. No definite aneurysm was observed in any of the 96 patients. Small areas (2-4 mm) of contrast enhancement or signal void were detected in 11 patients. These areas are possibly due to vascular tortuosity, but the studies were considered to be indeterminate because a small aneurysm could not be ruled out. Cerebral angiography in two of these 11 patients was normal. Arachnoid cysts were observed more frequently in the patients with polycystic kidney disease than in a control group of patients matched by gender, age, and type and date of examination. \nDistribution of the VLA family of integrins in normal and pathological human liver tissue. The \"very late activation\" (VLA) subgroup of the integrin superfamily of adhesion molecules plays a central role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The six different VLA dimers known so far consist of a common beta subunit and a variable alpha (1 to 6) subunit. They serve as receptors for laminin, collagen, and fibronectin or function as adhesion molecules for leukocytes and are therefore of great significance in embryogenesis, growth and repair, and in leukocyte recirculation. The distribution of the common beta and the variable alpha chains of the VLA were studied in normal, inflammatory, and cholestatic liver biopsy samples. In normal liver tissue, vascular endothelia express alpha 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; bile duct epithelium alpha 2, 3, 5, and 6; connective tissue stroma alpha 1 and 2; hepatocytes alpha 1 and 5; sinusoidal lining cells alpha 1, 2, and 5; and mononuclear cells alpha 4. Whereas bile ducts and vascular endothelia do not show relevant changes in alpha chain expression in liver diseases, hepatocytes de novo express membranous alpha 3 and 6 in inflammatory liver diseases. In view of the role of the VLA-3 and VLA-6 as laminin receptors, this finding is in line with the production of laminin in active liver disease. Moreover, de novo expression of \"bile duct type\" alpha 2, 3, and 6 on periportal hepatocytes in cholestatic liver disease likely illustrates a phenotypic switch of hepatocytes towards bile duct epithelium during cholestasis. \nSuperior mesenteric artery syndrome in acute traumatic quadriplegia: case reports and literature review. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a condition in which the third portion of the duodenum is intermittently compressed by the overlying superior mesenteric artery, resulting in gastrointestinal obstruction. Predisposing factors include rapid weight loss, prolonged supine positioning, and using a spinal orthosis, all of which are common among acute traumatic quadriplegic patients. This paper presents three patients, aged 24, 16, and 20 years, with traumatic quadriplegia treated with supine positioning and cervical orthoses, who had postprandial nausea and emesis, bloating, and abdominal pain during rehabilitation. Upper gastrointestinal radiographic series demonstrated abrupt duodenal obstruction to barium flow in all three patients. Two of the patients had complete relief of symptoms with conservative management, and one required surgical duodenojejunostomy. Enhanced awareness of this condition may result in improved recognition of this disease as a cause of persistent, unexplained gastrointestinal disturbances in quadriplegic persons, thereby optimizing its treatment and reducing its potential morbidity. \nPlacental bed spiral arteries in the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE--The investigation of the histology of the placental bed spiral arteries in normal pregnancy and in pregnancies complicated by hypertension, with or without proteinura. DESIGN--An observational study, based on women having caesarean sections for clinical reasons. SUBJECTS--17 normal pregnant women, 43 with gestational hypertension, of whom 39 had proteinuria, 17 with chronic hypertension, of whom 6 had proteinuria, and 5 with unclassified hypertension. INTERVENTIONS--Placental bed biopsies obtained during caesarean section. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Histological appearance of sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin PAS and Lendrum's MSB. RESULTS--Biopsies containing spiral arteries were obtained from 6 normotensive and 44 hypertensive women. Trophoblastic invasion was present in 5 of the 6 normotensive biopsies but absent in the majority of those with hypertension. Subintimal proliferation was seen in all the normotensive biopsies but in only 8 of 28 from those with gestational hypertension and proteinuria. Other features seen predominantly or only in the hypertensive biopsies, in order of frequency, were medial hyperplasia, fibrin deposits, acute atherosis, endothelial vacuolation and thrombosis. CONCLUSION--Absence of physiological changes may not be peculiar to preeclampsia but may be associated or even a result of various forms of hypertension in pregnancy. Spiral arteries show a spectrum of changes in hypertensive pregnancies that do not appear to bear a clear-cut relation to the clinical signs. \nProstacyclin production by blood-contacting surfaces of endothelialized vascular prostheses. This study examines prostacyclin production by blood-contacting surfaces within woven vascular prostheses of polydioxanone (PDS), polyglactin 910 (PG910), or Dacron interposed into rabbit infrarenal aortas. Grafts and normal aortic segments were explanted after 1, 3, and 6 months for pulsatile perfusion with Medium-199 for 60 minutes. Aliquots were removed serially for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha assay. After 30 minutes sodium arachidonate (10 micrograms/ml) was added. Specimens were studied by light microscopy, SEM and TEM. Patency in all three groups exceeded 90%. All three showed re-endothelialization at one month. Normal aorta produced low basal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha with a marked evanescent post arachidonate increase. Dacron did not differ from normal aorta. PG910 and PDS both produced significantly less 6-keto-PGF1 alpha post arachidonate at one month but both increased to normal by three months. \nCholedochoduodenostomy. Analysis of 71 cases followed for 5 to 15 years. To investigate the long-term effectiveness of choledochoduodenostomy (CDD), the experience with 71 patients followed for 5 or more years after CDD was analyzed retrospectively. From 1968 to 1984, 134 patients underwent CDD. Eight patients (6%) died in the immediate postoperative period, 55 left the hospital, 8 of them were lost to follow-up, and 47 were followed but died before 5 years elapsed after CDD. The remaining 71 patients form the data base for this analysis: 38 were followed for more than 5 years, 25 were followed for more than 10 years, and 8 were followed for more than 15 years (mean 12.1 years +/- 1.3 SEM). Choledocholithiasis, chronic pancreatitis, and postoperative stricture were the indications for CDD. Cholangitis was observed in only three patients. The diameter of the common bile duct (CBD) was large in most patients (mean 18 mm +/- 0.9 SEM). These results infer that CDD is effective to treat non-neoplastic obstructing lesions of the distal CBD on a long-term basis and that the presence of a dilated CBD (more than 16 mm) that allows the construction of a CDD more than 14 mm is essential to obtain good results. \nThe threshold for myocardial ischemia varies in patients with coronary artery disease depending on the exercise protocol. It is generally accepted that angina pectoris and, presumably, myocardial ischemia occur at a fixed heart rate-systolic blood pressure product in a given patient. This concept of a fixed threshold has recently been challenged. To evaluate the effects of varying exercise intensity on the ischemic threshold, 33 patients with coronary artery disease and provokable myocardial ischemia, documented by thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging, underwent two exercise tests 2 to 7 days apart. A symptom-limited incremental treadmill exercise test was followed by a 20 min submaximal treadmill test at an intensity approximating 70% of the peak heart rate attained during the incremental test. During the incremental exercise test, angina pectoris developed in 16 patients and 17 patients were asymptomatic. At least 0.1 mV of ST segment depression developed in all subjects during the incremental exercise test at a mean exercise duration of 5.3 +/- 2.6 min, a rate-pressure product of 19,130 +/- 5,735 and oxygen uptake of 19.6 +/- 7.0 ml/kg per min. During the submaximal exercise test, 28 (85%) of the 33 patients had significant ST segment depression. Of these patients, 24 (86%) were asymptomatic, including 10 patients who had previously reported anginal symptoms during the incremental test. The average time to onset of 0.1 mV ST segment depression during the submaximal test was 8.1 +/- 4.5 min. These changes occurred at a rate-pressure product of 15,250 +/- 3,705 and an oxygen uptake of 14.3 +/- 5.9 ml/kg per min, and were significantly (p less than 0.001) lower than values observed during the graded exercise. \nNeurocysticercosis: regression of a fourth ventricular cyst with praziquantel. Symptomatic intraventricular cysticerci are said to respond poorly to the anticestodial agent praziquantel. A case is reported of rapid regression of a large cyst of the fourth ventricle after oral praziquantel, avoiding the need for surgery. \nAttitudes of family practice residents about speech-language-hearing referrals. The \"family doctor\" has been identified as the professional most likely to be contacted by the general public with concerns about communication disorders; yet the family practice physician is unlikely to refer patients with communicative disorders to speech-language pathologists or audiologists for nonmedical evaluation and treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine attitudes of family practice residents about referral patterns for communication disorders using a survey format. Thirty-nine residents estimated that they had referred an average of 1.5 patients to a speech-language pathologist and 2.2 patients to an audiologist during a six-month interval. The findings indicated that these residents did not routinely refer patients to speech-language pathologists. When they did refer, a limited view of communication problems was used. \nEndoscopic palliative management of rectal cancer. Laser ablation and bipolar coagulation have been used to palliate rectal cancer and avoid surgery. Indications are distal metastatic disease, extensive local invasion, obstruction and bleeding from nonresectable rectal tumor, or refusal of surgery. From Jan 1, 1986, to Jan 1, 1989, I saw 26 patients who met those criteria; 19 already had metastatic disease and three repeatedly refused abdominoperineal resection. A two-laser approach using both CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers was used in patients with low-lying lesions; others were treated by the Nd:YAG laser only. For rectal tumors, bipolar esophageal tumor probes were used via the rigid sigmoidoscope. The number of laser sessions averaged three per patient, and the number of bipolar coagulation sessions averaged five per patient. Bleeding followed bipolar coagulation in one patient. There were no perforations in either treatment group, and no patient has required colostomy. Of the 19 patients who already had metastatic disease, 12 are still alive, the longest survival being 20 months. Of those medically unfit for surgery, three have died of coincidental disease, and one is alive with controlled rectal cancer after 16 months. All three patients who refused surgery are alive; the longest survival is 13 months. \nNutritional support in liver failure. The most important manifestations of advanced liver disease are malnutrition, encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome. Appropriate and optimal nutritional and metabolic support with specially formulated solutions enriched in branched-chain amino acids, together with other advanced treatments such as plasmapheresis, hemofiltration, and continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis, can correct the most important metabolic and clinical aberrations and temporarily improve the quality of life. However, the ultimately poor prognosis of patients with severe liver failure has not been altered significantly to date by the provision of nonspecific or specifically tailored nutrient regimens. The prognosis appears to depend on the arrest, correction, or reversal of the primary pathophysiologic process. \nThe concept of silent otitis media. Its importance and implications. This article defines silent otitis media and describes its continuum of signs and symptoms and its sequelae. Chronic silent otitis media and silent otitis media in children are also examined, and treatment principles are provided. \nEndoscopic injection sclerosis: effective treatment for bleeding peptic ulcer. One hundred and nine patients presenting with severe haemorrhage from benign peptic ulcers were randomised to either endoscopic injection sclerotherapy using a combination of 1:100,000 adrenaline and 5% ethanolamine or to conservative treatment. Only high risk patients with active bleeding or endoscopic stigmata of recent haemorrhage and accessible ulcers were considered. The two groups were well matched for age, shock, haemoglobin concentration, endoscopic findings, and consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The group treated endoscopically had a significantly reduced rebleeding rate (12.5% v 47%, p less than 0.001). Rebleeding was successfully treated in some patients by injection sclerotherapy, other patients underwent urgent surgery. While there was a tendency towards a lower operation rate and lower transfusion requirements in the treated group, this failed to achieve statistical significance. The use of injection sclerotherapy in the conservatively treated group after rebleeding undoubtedly reduced the number of surgical operations. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy is effective in the prevention of rebleeding in these patients. \nRecurrent and de novo renal disease after kidney transplantation with or without cyclosporine A. We evaluated the clinical course of 700 renal transplantations, including 1,305 transplant histologies performed in 611 patients between 1970 and 1988, to estimate the influence of cyclosporine A (CsA) after kidney transplantation on the incidence of recurrent or de novo renal disease. Primary renal disease recurred in 11 of 583 functioning transplants (1.9%) with transplant loss in seven patients (1.2%): focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS, three patients); membranous glomerulonephritis (GN, one patient); mesangiocapillary GN (one patient); rapidly progressive IgA nephropathy (one patient); hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS, three patients); and oxalosis in two transplants (one patient). De novo renal disease occurred in six patients (1.0%), including mesangiocapillary GN type I (three patients); nonpurulent focal GN in septicemia (one patient); HUS (one patient); and nodular glomerulosclerosis in steroid diabetes (one patient). De novo membranous GN was seen in 14 additional cases (2.4%). No statistically significant difference could be established between the treatment groups without (n = 225) and with (n = 358) CsA in recurrent and de novo renal disease (n = 7/225 v 10/358, NS); in recurrent and de novo GN (n = 4/225 v 6/358, NS); in recurrent FSGS (n = 1/7 v 2/8, NS); in recurrent and de novo HUS (n - 1/1 v 2/7, NS); and in de novo membranous GN (n = 7/225 v 7/358, NS). Transplant loss by recurrent and de novo GN was higher without than with CsA (n = 4/4 v 1/6, P = 0.004). On the basis of our investigation, we conclude that recurrent and de novo renal disease in the transplant occur rarely and are not prevented by CsA. However, even if the incidence of transplant GN is unchanged by CsA treatment, its clinical course seems to be mitigated. CsA treatment also does not increase the incidence of HUS. \nDendritic hypertrophy in Purkinje neurons of old Fischer 344 rats after long-term ethanol treatment. Metric parameters of Purkinje cell dendritic networks in 24- to 26-month-old Fischer 344 rats were determined after 48 weeks of chronic ethanol intake. Measurements included the total number and length of all segments/network, the total number and length of segments within topologically defined segment categories, and the mean length of segments in each category. A main effect of ethanol was expressed as a significant increase in cumulative length within one category of terminal segments. This increase was the result of a significant increase in mean length/segment in that category. Metric changes in other segment categories were not significant, showing that changes in the networks during ethanol treatment were not distributed randomly. Recovery after ethanol treatment was associated with further nonrandom remodeling of these networks. Significant differences in lengths of terminal segments were no longer present, but internal segments in networks of both pair-fed and ethanol-fed rats were significantly longer. Only one category of internal segments showed this change during recovery. The data showed that long term ethanol treatment in old rats, at a time when effects of aging processes were prominent in Purkinje cell networks, was associated with remodeling of those networks through dendritic extension. This effect was interpreted as compensatory growth in surviving networks following ethanol-related neuronal loss and/or damage to the surrounding neuropil. Recovery from dietary treatment produced further internal remodeling of those networks that was not related specifically to ethanol. It could be shown, however, that the restructuring processes that resulted in longer internal segments after dietary recovery were different in the pair-fed and the ethanolfed rats. \nAural rehabilitation. Aural rehabilitation involves a complete evaluation of the communication deficits and needs of the hearing-impaired patient as well as the provision of counselling and therapy. This article describes listening-assistive devices, speech production, and audiovisual training. Issues related to educational placement and tinnitus also are reviewed. \nCation-induced restoration of insulin action in insulin-desensitized HTC cells. Insulin desensitization of amino acid uptake in HTC cells was induced by preincubation with 4 or 10 micrograms/ml insulin. Insulin binding after desensitisation was decreased by both insulin concentrations due to a 45-49% decrease in insulin receptor numbers. Desensitization with 4 micrograms/ml insulin increased the ED50 for half-maximal stimulation of amino acid uptake from 19.5 +/- 9.2 ng/ml in control cells to 84.0 +/- 8.3 ng/ml (P less than 0.0001). It also decreased the maximal insulin response of amino acid uptake from 1.40 +/- 0.10 to 1.14 +/- 0.10 nmol/mg protein, indicating the production of a mild postreceptor defect. Desensitization with 10 micrograms/ml insulin completely abolished this insulin response. When cellular receptors were down-regulated with 4 micrograms/ml insulin and restimulated with insulin in the presence of 0.03 mM ruthenium red (RR) or 10 mM Ca2+, both the insulin response and insulin binding were increased. Insulin binding was restored to levels comparable to those observed in control cells by an increase in receptor affinity. The ED50 of amino acid uptake decreased to 20.5 +/- 7.3 ng/ml insulin in the presence of RR and to 42.2 +/- 8.9 ng/ml in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+ (both P less than 0.0001 from down-regulated cells). In addition, the maximal insulin response increased from 1.14 +/- 0.10 to 1.40 +/- 0.10 and 1.45 +/- 0.10 nmol/mg protein, respectively. Preincubation with 10 micrograms/ml insulin prevented the effect of RR and Ca2+ on the recovery of insulin responses. These experiments suggest that insulin-desensitized cells undergo a progressive loss of their insulin response and that RR and Ca2+ provide useful reagents to investigate the mechanisms of this process because they can counteract the decrease in insulin response by increasing receptor affinity and receptor-effector coupling. \nEsophageal tuberculosis: a rare presentation with hematemesis. Esophageal tuberculosis is rare, with only 26 cases previously reported in the literature. Patients usually present with progressive dysphagia or odynophagia. We report a patient with hematemesis that was later attributed to the erosion of tuberculous subcarinal lymph nodes into the esophagus. This presentation has been described in only two other patients, both of whom died of exsanguinating hemorrhage. The successful outcome in the present case rested on the availability of rapid diagnostic modalities and timely surgical intervention. \nCombined intertrochanteric and Chiari pelvic osteotomies for hip dysplasia. Thirty-two dysplastic hips with secondary osteoarthritis, in 28 patients aged 18 to 42 years, were treated by combined intertrochanteric and Chiari osteotomy. They were followed up for 2.5 to 10 years. Pain was the main presenting symptom in all the patients. The indication for surgery was based on the severity of disease with respect to congruency, secondary degenerative change and degree of dysplasia. The average pre-operative Harris hip score was 47.7 and the majority had severe dysplasia with degenerative changes. On final review the average score was 88. The radiographic appearances of degenerative arthritis regressed in 72% of hips and dysplasia was improved in all cases. The results of this conservative form of surgery are better in hips with less severe dysplasia and mild secondary degenerative change. \nLow-dose aspirin therapy for chronic stable angina. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, trial. PATIENTS: The study included 333 men with baseline chronic stable angina but with no previous history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack who were enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study, a trial of aspirin among 22,071 male physicians. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive alternate-day aspirin therapy (325 mg) or placebo and were followed for an average of 60.2 months for the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: During follow-up, 27 patients had confirmed myocardial infarctions; 7 were among the 178 patients with chronic stable angina who received aspirin therapy and 20 were among the 155 patients who received placebo (relative risk, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.63; P = 0.003). While simultaneously controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors in a proportional hazards model, an overall 87% risk reduction was calculated (relative risk, 0.13; CI, 0.04 to 0.42; P less than 0.001). For the subgroup of patients with chronic stable angina but no previous coronary bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty, an almost identical reduction in the risk for myocardial infarction was found (relative risk, 0.14; CI, 0.04 to 0.56; P = 0.006). Of 13 strokes, 11 occurred in the aspirin group and 2 in the placebo group (relative risk, 5.4; CI, 1.3 to 22.1; P = 0.02). No stroke was fatal, but 4 produced some long-term impairment of function. One stroke, in the aspirin group, was hemorrhagic. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that alternate-day aspirin therapy greatly reduced the risk for first myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina, a group of patients at high risk for cardiovascular death (P less than 0.001). Although our results for stroke were based on small numbers, they suggested an apparent increase in frequency of stroke with aspirin therapy; this finding requires confirmation in randomized trials of adequate sample size. \nCytologic detection of colorectal cancer after administration of oral lavage solution. Whether malignant cells can be detected in the bowel movements induced by oral gut lavage solution administration was studied in patients with known colonic adenocarcinomas. The induced bowel movements were collected in 27 patients, nine of whom had cancer proven by anatomic pathologic examination. The cells present were recovered with a simple technique and stained by the Papanicolaou method. Malignant cells were identified in the stained preparations in all nine patients with cancer (100% sensitivity), and there were few false positives (94.5% specificity). The authors concluded that if additional studies with greater numbers of subjects confirm the reliability of this technique, a test may be developed that would be useful for either early detection or screening. \nCritically ischemic myocardium in clinically stable patients following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction: potential implications for early coronary angioplasty in selected patients. The utility of post-thrombolysis, rest-redistribution thallium (TI)-201 scintigraphy was studied in 32 patients with a first myocardial infarction who were clinically stable following reperfusion. Day 1 scintigraphy obtained 5 +/- 4 hours (range 1 to 16) after thrombolysis revealed an average perfusion defect of 6.5 +/- 2.6 segments (range 1 to 11). There was a total of 208 abnormal segments, 137 of which were nonreversible at 4 hours, 50 of which were fully or partially reversible, and 21 of which had a reverse redistribution pattern. Repeat TI-201 scintigraphy on day 10 revealed significantly smaller perfusion defects of 4.9 +/- 2.4 segments (range 0 to 9) with improvement predominantly of the day 1 reversible segments, and the improvement in segmental perfusion correlated with better regional left ventricular function. Twenty-nine (58%) of the 50 reversible segments normalized by day 10, and 11 (22%) improved, whereas only 16 (12%) of 137 nonreversible segments had normalized by day 10, only 9 had (6%) improved and 112 (82%) were unchanged (p less than 0.001 reversible versus nonreversible). There was no significant change in segments with a pattern of reverse redistribution. The improvement of reversible segments was greater in the 16 patients who underwent coronary angioplasty (PTCA) during the interval between the two scintigrams than in the 16 who did not. All 24 reversible segments in the PTCA group improved or normalized by day 10 compared with 16 (62%) of 26 reversible segments in the No PTCA group (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, 8 of the 10 reversible segments in the No PTCA group that did not improve actually deteriorated and became nonreversible by day 10. The minor improvement of nonreversible segments was not related to PTCA. Consistent with the findings in individual segments, the 19 patients with a reversible component on the day 1 TI-201 scintigram had significantly greater improvement in perfusion defect by day 10 than the 13 patients without a reversible component (37 +/- 33% versus 7 +/- 22% decrease in perfusion defect severity, p less than 0.05), and this improvement was greatest in the 10 patients with a reversible component who underwent PTCA. In contrast, PTCA had no impact on the perfusion defect in the 13 patients without a reversible component. Our data suggest that following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, viable myocardium in the reperfused zone may remain ischemic, as manifested by a reversible pattern of TI-201 redistribution at rest, and thus may be in jeopardy of gradual progression to necrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nThe role of platelets, thrombin and hyperplasia in restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Coronary angioplasty has become a successful and widely used treatment for patients with coronary artery disease since its first clinical application in 1977. The primary success rate has improved despite the increase in procedure and case complexity. However, acute reocclusion and late restenosis, which constitute the most important problems after successful angioplasty, continue to occur in about 5% and 35% of patients within 3 to 6 months, respectively. Angioscopic and pathologic observations have suggested that a multifactorial pathophysiologic process accounts for acute reocclusion, involving marked thrombosis, intimal dissection, medial and subintimal hemorrhage, vascular recoil and vasocontriction. In contrast, chronic restenosis involves the development of fibrocellular intimal hyperplasia within a milieu created by vascular injury, platelet activation, thrombin generation and the release of mitogens. Although current pharmacologic approaches, which involve antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy, have been largely ineffective in eliminating acute reocclusion and chronic restenosis, recent advances in the research in thrombosis, platelet receptors and smooth muscle growth regulation have allowed new therapeutic options to be tested in the experimental setting, with subsequent potential clinical applications in patients. \nParamedics: knowledge base and attitudes towards AIDS and hepatitis. We surveyed 420 paramedics employed by a large metropolitan fire department to determine the effects of educational seminars on their knowledge base, perceptions, and attitudes about AIDS and hepatitis B. All surveys were completed on an anonymous, voluntary, and confidential basis. Our educational efforts improved the paramedics' knowledge base concerning the medical manifestations of AIDS, identification of risk factors, modes of transmission, and means of infection control, but had no impact on paramedics' fear of contracting AIDS. While paramedics have a strong fear of contracting AIDS, we note that they underestimate their risk of acquiring hepatitis B. Only 17% of paramedics surveyed had received the hepatitis vaccine, despite attending an infectious disease seminar addressing the occupational risks of acquiring hepatitis B infections during the previous year. Further educational efforts to address the paramedics' attitudes about AIDS, as well as to encourage paramedics to recognize hepatitis B exposure as a significant personal health risk, are currently being pursued. \nThe role of the pathologist in the management of breast cancer. The pathologist is a consultant in breast cancer management whose responsibility is to establish the histologic diagnosis of cancer as well as its anatomic extent once sufficient tissue has been provided. The consultation also provides data that may be used to aid in selecting primary or adjuvant therapy, evaluating new therapies, estimating prognosis, and assessing outcome. Examples of such data are the TNM histopathologic classification of the anatomic extent of the cancer used for the stage grouping (T = the extent of the primary tumor, N = the absence or presence and extent of regional lymph node metastasis, and M = the absence or presence of distant metastasis); tumor size, histologic type, and histologic and/or nuclear grade; assessment of blood vessel and lymphatic vessel invasion; analysis of steroid receptors, and other special studies as appropriate. \nProminent meningeal \"tail sign\" in a patient with a metastatic tumor. A prominent enhancement of the dura adjacent to meningiomas has been described as being pathognomonic of these tumors. We describe a case where a classic meningeal \"tail sign\" was associated with an extra-axial metastatic tumor attached to the tentorium. There was no tumor invasion of the dura. We conclude that this sign is nonspecific and can be seen with dural-based tumors other than meningiomas. \nRecurrent haemospermia--underlying urogenital anomalies and efficacy of imaging procedures. Recurrent haemospermia is often regarded as \"essential\". Following routine diagnostic procedures, we found an associated factor in 54 of 72 patients (75%). With one exception (prostatic carcinoma), the benign character of the disease was confirmed. Urogenital infection was the most frequent concomitant finding (50%); in 26 men chronic prostatis was diagnosed. Other disorders such as hypertension and coagulation disorders played a minor role. Additional investigation of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles by transrectal prostatic ultrasonography revealed persistent asymmetry of the latter glands as the main finding in 20 men (28%). In every case seminal vesicle carcinoma was excluded; haemorrhage due to cystic distension, inflammatory lesions or ductal obstruction was associated in all cases with congenital abnormalities, chronic urogenital infection, coagulation disorders or hypertension. \nObstructive dilatation of extrahepatic recipient and donor bile ducts complicating orthotopic liver transplantation: imaging and laboratory findings. Biliary obstruction in liver transplants is most commonly due to stricture at the biliary anastomosis. The native common bile duct typically is normal. We retrospectively studied 28 patients with choledochocholedochostomy anastomoses who had marked native and donor extrahepatic bile duct dilatation associated with clinical evidence of biliary obstruction. Operative cholangiograms were compared with postoperative cholangiograms obtained a mean of 50 weeks (range, 2-246 weeks) later. Mean caliber of the native common bile duct increased from 7.5 +/- 2.0 mm on operative cholangiograms to 14.8 +/- 3.9 mm on postoperative cholangiograms (p less than .001). Mean caliber of the donor common hepatic duct increased from 5.9 +/- 1.3 mm on operative cholangiograms to 12.8 +/- 3.8 mm on postoperative cholangiograms (p less than .001). Dilatation of the cystic duct remnant was seen in 15 patients. All patients had surgical revision to choledochojejunostomy with improved results of liver function studies in most cases. Diffuse dilatation of native and donor extrahepatic bile ducts may develop in liver transplant recipients. Typical features include native and donor extrahepatic ducts greater than 12 mm in diameter and a dilated cystic duct remnant on postoperative cholangiography in a patient with otherwise unexplained hepatic dysfunction. \nRegional cerebral blood flow in developmental stutterers. Stuttering is a poorly understood communication disorder with a 1% global prevalence. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in a neurogenic origin for the disorder, although no research has established clear neurological differences between \"developmental\" (stuttering onset in childhood) stutterers and nonstutterers. We have used xenon 133 single-photon emission computed tomography to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 20 stutterers. Analysis revealed global, absolute flow reductions. Relative flow asymmetries (left less than right) were identified in three hemispheric regions: anterior cingulate and superior and middle temporal gyri. Milder changes were found in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Stutterers had rCBF values below median for either anterior cingulate or middle temporal gyri. With one exception, severe stutterers had rCBF values below median for the anterior cingulate gyrus. All stutterers with rCBF values above median in the cingulate gyrus had rCBF values below median in the middle temporal gyrus, and severity of their disorder was either mild or moderate. Our findings suggest that stuttering is a neurogenic disorder involving recognized cortical regions of speech-motor control. \nWhat if Americans ate less fat? A quantitative estimate of the effect on mortality. Americans consume an average of 37% of their energy intake as fat. Many authorities recommend restricting fat intake to 30% of energy intake to reduce the rates of coronary heart disease and perhaps of cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate. Based on the assumptions that underlie those recommendations, we estimated the effect of this dietary change on mortality. If all Americans restricted their intake of dietary fat by reducing consumption of saturated fat and accompanying dietary cholesterol, the corresponding reductions in serum cholesterol levels could reduce coronary heart disease mortality rates by 5% to 20%, depending on age. If the relationship between dietary fat and cancer is as strong as has been observed in some studies, the proportional effects on mortality from fat-related cancers could be even greater, although the absolute effects--given the lower mortality rates--would be smaller. Overall, if the assumptions are correct, about 42,000 of the 2.3 million deaths that would have occurred in adults each year in the United States could be deferred. This 2% benefit, equivalent to an increase in average life expectancy of 3 to 4 months, would accrue chiefly to people over the age of 65 years. If recent concerns about the possibly harmful effects of cholesterol lowering on mortality from noncardiovascular causes--which mainly affect younger persons--are valid, these relatively modest benefits would be overestimates of the actual effect. \nStimulation of pancreas and gastric carcinoma cell growth by interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Hematopoietic growth factors have recently been well characterized by complementary DNA cloning. For human epidermal growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor recombinant proteins have been expressed in Escherichia coli. To reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy on the bone marrow, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant human interleukin 3 were applied to patients suffering of gastrointestinal cancers. To determine the influence of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant human interleukin 3 on human pancreas and gastric cancer cell cells in vitro, a sensitive microculture test system was established that allows precise quantification of proliferation. A more than twofold enhancement of proliferation was observed by interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in two of two cell cultures derived from gastric carcinoma cells, while two of nine cultures from pancreas carcinoma cells have shown enhanced cell growth in the presence of recombinant human interleukin 3 or recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In comparison, recombinant human epidermal growth factor increased cell growth in two of two gastric and in five of nine pancreas carcinoma cultures. In general, 1-10 ng/mL of the growth factors yielded the highest growth rate, but even 1-pg amounts produced increased cell growth. Expression of messenger RNA for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, and the oncogene HER2/neu remained undetectable in all of the tested cell lines, while the various abundance of messenger RNA for the epidermal growth factor receptor was different in each cell line. The reported results imply that the hematopoietic growth factors interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor influence cellular growth of pancreas and gastric carcinoma cells by a paracrine mechanism and may possess a more general regulatory function than originally anticipated. \nSquamous cell carcinoma of the cornea. We treated two patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea without involvement of the corneoscleral limbus. Superficial keratectomy and cryotherapy in one patient and penetrating keratoplasty in the other patient resulted in no recurrence of the tumor after 46 and nine months, respectively. Actinic damage and late manifestation caused by poor vision in both eyes of both patients may have been the risk factors for development of this tumor. \nIntraocular pressure-dependent retinal vascular change in adult chronic open-angle glaucoma patients. Intraocular pressure (IOP)-dependent retinal vascular changes were investigated in 33 eyes of 33 adult chronic open-angle glaucoma (COAG) patients by measuring major retinal vascular calibers at the optic disc border before and after mean (+/- standard deviation) IOP reduction from 35.3 (+/- 7.2) to 16.5 (+/- 4.7) mmHg for 11.2 (+/- 13.5) weeks. Both mean arterial and venous calibers were significantly reduced (P less than 0.0001 for each), from 87.8 (+/- 14.2) and 128.3 (+/- 20.8) microns at high IOP to 82.0 (+/- 13.8) and 121.4 (+/- 18.5) microns at low IOP. Arterial and venous caliber decreases correlated positively with magnitude of IOP reduction (r = 0.503, P less than 0.01 and r = 0.555, P less than 0.001, respectively). While the IOP-dependent retinal arterial caliber change was highly significant in patients 55 years of age or younger (r = 0.636, P less than 0.01) and in the overall study group, it was not significant in patients older than 55 years (r = 0.205, P greater than 0.1). Age seems to be more influential than magnitude of IOP reduction in patients older than 55. Thus, diminished IOP-dependent retinal arterial caliber change in the elderly may be one factor contributing to the higher incidence and prevalence of glaucoma in this population. \nDisturbed secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with persistent atrial standstill: endocrinologic silence. Persistent atrial standstill is a very rare pathophysiologic condition whose diagnosis is established when both electrical and mechanical silence of the atria are confirmed. To test the hypothesis that secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide is disturbed in patients with persistent atrial standstill, the response of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and other neurohormonal factors during exercise was investigated in three patients with a rate-responsive ventricular demand (VVI) pacemaker implanted for confirmed persistent atrial standstill. The results were compared with those observed in eight normal subjects and patients with a rate-responsive VVI (Group A) or atrial demand (AAI) (Group B) pacemaker implanted for confirmed sick sinus syndrome. Patients in Group A displayed significant elevation of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide secretion both before and during exercise (122.5 +/- 14.8 and 207.5 +/- 8.3 pg/ml, respectively) compared with those in Group B (55 +/- 14.1 and 116.4 +/- 51.5 pg/ml, respectively) and the normal subjects (18.9 +/- 9.8 and 30.8 +/- 19.2 pg/ml, respectively). This indicated development of a nonphysiologic increase in atrial volume or pressure overload, or both, in rate-responsive VVI pacing because of lack of atrioventricular synchrony. However, patients with persistent atrial standstill had undetectable (less than 10 pg/ml) or almost undetectable secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide as well as lower levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the circulation both before and during exercise. Changes in plasma catecholamines during exercise were similar in patients with persistent atrial standstill compared with the other groups. This study indicates that \"endocrinologic silence\" accompanies electrical and mechanical silence of the atria, which may constitute a third diagnostic clue to persistent atrial standstill. \nDo Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients of Jewish Libyan origin have unique clinical features? A focus of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is present in Israel among Jews born in Libya. The present study examines the clinical features in this particular group of patients. In a country-wide study of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, we identified 114 patients; 49 were Libyan immigrants, and 65 (three of whom had Libyan ancestors) were born in other countries. The clinical presentation and evolution of the disease is very similar in patients born in Libya and others without Libyan ancestors, but it tends to be more classical in the Libyan patients, with higher frequency of myoclonic jerks and periodic EEG and a progressive course of shorter duration. The Libyan patients tend to complain more often of headache, which is most probably an ethnic expression for depression and loss of concentration. There was no difference between the familial and nonfamilial cases. \nDiagnosis and treatment of cluster headache. This article classifies cluster headaches as distinct from other types of headaches and gives guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. Explanations of the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of cluster headaches are included also. \nNosocomial pneumonia and the role of gastric pH. A meta-analysis. PURPOSE: To examine the differential effect of drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis on nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill patients. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Computerized bibliographic search of published and unpublished research. STUDY SELECTION: Independent review of 48 randomized controlled trials of prophylaxis identified eight relevant studies. DATA ABSTRACTION: The population, intervention, and outcomes were evaluated by duplicate independent review. RESULTS: The incidence of pneumonia was lower in critically ill patients receiving antacids and/or histamine-2-receptor antagonists as compared with patients receiving no stress ulcer prophylaxis (common odds ratio 0.42, 95 percent CI 0.17 to 1.11). When stress ulcer prophylactic therapy was titrated to achieve a gastric pH of 3.5 or greater, there was a trend favoring a decreased incidence of pneumonia (0.66, 95 percent CI 0.24 to 1.78). In trials comparing sucralfate with pH-altering drugs, the common odds ratio of 0.55 (0.28 to 1.06) suggests a 45 percent risk reduction with the use of sucralfate. CONCLUSION: Stress ulcer prophylaxis with drugs which raise gastric pH does not increase the incidence of pneumonia in comparison to placebo or control therapy. The use of sucralfate is associated with a lower incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in comparison to agents which raise gastric pH. However, methodologic deficiencies, small sample sizes, and the failure to examine the effects of antacids and histamine-2-receptor antagonists separately make a large prospective randomized trial necessary to confirm or refute these findings. \nPharmacokinetic analysis of coronary venous retroinfusion: a comparison with anterograde coronary artery drug administration using metoprolol as a tracer. Plasma and myocardial tissue concentrations of metoprolol were studied in ischemic and nonischemic areas of 22 pigs after 90 (n = 19) and 16 (n = 3) min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Group A (n = 6) received simultaneous intravenous metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg body weight) and tritium-labeled (3H)-metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) retrogradely into the coronary vein. In group B (n = 5), metoprolol and 3H-metoprolol were administered in the same way, but at half the volume to study the influence of derived coronary venous pressure on the myocardial concentration of drug. In group C (n = 3), metoprolol was given retrogradely and saline solution was infused into the left anterior descending artery before induced death to wash out metoprolol from the coronary veins. To rule out a possible influence of the development of myocardial necrosis on drug distribution, metoprolol was retroinfused after 1 min of arterial occlusion in three pigs (group D). In group E (n = 5), metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) was infused anterogradely into the left anterior descending artery. Peak plasma concentration was significantly higher after intravenous infusion of metoprolol (1,188 +/- 503 nmol/liter) than after coronary venous infusion (417 +/- 155 nmol/liter; p less than 0.001). In groups A and B, the nonischemic myocardial concentration of metoprolol was 250 to 300 pmol/g, whether the drug was infused intravenously or into the coronary vein. Coronary venous retroinfusion, however, resulted in a substantial accumulation of metoprolol in the ischemic myocardium. In group A pigs, subendocardial myocardial concentration was 16,800 +/- 7,774, mid-myocardial 39,590 +/- 18,043 and subepicardial 57,143 +/- 29,030 pmol/g (mean +/- SE). The ischemic myocardial concentration in pigs from group B was somewhat less pronounced, probably secondary to a lower coronary venous pressure (15 +/- 3 mm Hg) with the lower volume of infusion (6.1 +/- 0.3 ml) in group B compared with 32 +/- 5 mm Hg with a 14 +/- 1 ml infusion in group A. Coronary artery anterograde administration resulted in myocardial ischemic and nonischemic zone drug concentrations similar to those observed after retroinfusion into the coronary vein. With both modes of administration, there was a transmyocardial gradient from a somewhat lower drug concentration in the subendocardium, toward an increasing level in the mid-myocardium, to the highest concentration in the subepicardial zone of the ischemic myocardium. Coronary venous retroinfusion resulted in pronounced drug accumulation in the ischemic myocardium. The derived coronary venous pressure during infusion influenced the concentration of drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nEndocrine manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Endocrine manifestations of HIV infection include both pathological changes and disturbances in function. Mechanisms include direct infection of glands by HIV or opportunistic organisms, infiltration by neoplasms, side effects of drugs, and production of humoral factors that may alter metabolism. The adrenal gland is most often affected, but virtually every endocrine system may be involved. Dysfunction is often subtle, with symptoms overlapping those of the HIV infection itself. Endocrine manifestations may be found at any time in the course of the disease, from the asymptomatic HIV-positive stage through full-blown AIDS. Optimal management of these patients may include a careful search for, and appropriate treatment of, associated endocrine abnormalities. \nUncemented total hip arthroplasty. Prospective analysis of the tri-lock femoral component. Fifty consecutive hip disease patients (56 hips) with total hip arthroplasties (THA) utilized the uncemented Tri-Lock femoral component. Forty-five patients (51 hips) were followed for an average of 46 months (range, 24-66). Forty-two patients (47 hips) were followed with clinical examination and roentgenographs, three (four hips) by telephone interview, four (four hips) were deceased, and one (one hip) was lost to follow-up evaluation. The diagnoses included osteoarthritis (30 hips), avascular necrosis (11 hips), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (two hips), and degenerative joint disease secondary to childhood hip disorder (four hips). Of 47 hips, 34 were graded excellent, seven good, three fair, and three poor using the Harris hip score. The incidence of thigh pain was 19% at one year, but only 6% at final follow-up evaluation. Limp persisted in 19% of the patients. Of the three patients with four hips contacted by telephone, two had slight pain and two had no pain. The roentgenographic results found an alarming 38% incidence of varus shift of the components, relative to their preoperative position. The presence of a varus shift did not adversely affect the clinical results. Early experience with the Tri-Lock femoral component shows results comparable to those reported in the literature. The high incidence of femoral component shift, presumably because of geometry of the stem is of concern. Longer follow-up evaluation will be necessary to determine the fate of these uncemented THA operations. \nGastric cancer after gastric bypass for obesity. Case report. We describe a patient in whom gastric cancer developed after gastric bypass for morbid obesity. In addition, we review the literature to emphasize the technical problems involved in diagnosing disease in the excluded portion of the stomach. \nA newly developed drug delivery system using fine particles of activated charcoal for targeting chemotherapy. Targeting chemotherapy to the metastatic lesions of the lymph nodes after surgical removal of the main tumor, a drug delivery system using ultrafine particles of activated charcoal was developed and examined for its ability to adsorb mitomycin C (MMC) and to transport MMC to the lymph system. Satisfactory results were obtained. In animal experiments, serial sampling of thoracic duct lymph by cannulation and serial samplings of peripheral vein blood after injection of MMC-charcoal solution into the subserosal space of the intestinal wall were made to study the pharmacodynamics of the lymph-blood system through analysis of MMC regression curves. Clearance (K) and half-life (t1/2) are calculated from the formula; C(t) = C(t0) X e-kt, and compared with that of MMC-saline. Activated charcoal has a proven ability to transport MMC to the lymphatic system. With activated charcoal, MMC is retained for much longer in the lymph nodes than with saline. Congestion of the lymph system was produced by ligation of the thoracic duct in CH-40, with 25% prolongation of t1/2. In conclusion, these drug delivery systems are suitable for targeting chemotherapy at lymph node metastases, and it is proven that 1500 AA Mitsubishi ultrafine charcoal is a good carrier of drug and a slow drug-release material in the lymphatics. Minimal side effects are expected because of the constant low concentrations in the general circulation. \nEfficacy of ICS 205-930, a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, in the prevention of migraine attacks. A complex answer to a simple question. ICS 205-930 Migraine Study Group. To investigate whether the novel, potent and highly selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 can prevent migraine attacks, we conducted simultaneously two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, international trials, involving a total of 204 patients, suffering from classic or common migraine. Both trials had the same parallel-group design (1 month baseline observation, followed by 3 months treatment) and both produced remarkably similar results. The primary efficacy parameter was the proportional reduction in attack frequency recorded after 3 months of treatment. Twenty-two patients withdrew prematurely from the trials and could not be assessed for efficacy. Mild to severe constipation was reported by about 50% of the patients on active treatment. None of the doses of ICS 205-930 tested (50 mg, 25 mg and 15 mg daily) produced a statistically significantly better result to reduce attack frequency than did placebo. However, confidence intervals for the difference in effect with placebo were wide, indicating that 15 mg ICS 205-930 may produce a 57% reduction in attack frequency as compared to placebo. The most unusual finding was that, for all efficacy parameters, the best results were obtained with the lowest dose (15 mg), the worst results with the highest dose (50 mg) and an intermediate effect with 25 mg. Such an inverse relation between dose and efficacy suggests a bell-shaped dose-response curve, implying that doses lower than 15 mg might well prove to be more effective. Thus, the present study has produced inconclusive, but intriguing results. Lower doses should be further investigated before drawing any definite conclusion on the efficacy of ICS 205-930 in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. \nLong-term followup results after expectant management of stage A1 prostatic cancer. A total of 132 patients with stage A1 adenocarcinoma of the prostate was followed for 5 to 23 years (mean 8.2 years). Of these patients 52 underwent a second staging transurethral resection of the prostate between 1977 and 1986. Progressive disease developed in 3 of the 12 patients (25%) in whom residual foci of well differentiated cancer were detected by the second transurethral resection and who did not undergo further treatment. Of the 38 patients in whom the second transurethral resection did not detect residual cancer 3 (8%) also had progressive disease. From April 1989 to December 1989, 44 patients were re-evaluated by transrectal ultrasonography and ultrasonographically guided biopsies. Of these patients 3 had locally progressive disease. Progressive disease also developed in 4 more patients. Thus, 13 of the 132 patients (10%) had either locally or systemically progressive disease after long-term followup. The interval from diagnosis of stage A1 disease to detection of progression ranged from 6 months to 20 years (mean 7 years). Ten patients underwent definitive treatment for what was believed to be locally progressive disease, 2 underwent palliative therapy and 1 had no therapy due to poor physical condition. Of the 10 patients who underwent definitive therapy 6 are alive without evidence of disease, 2 died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease and 2 are alive with stage D1 disease. These data suggest that patients in whom a second staging transurethral resection of the prostate detects residual cancer have a high probability of progressive disease. Also, negative findings from a second staging transurethral resection may not exclude the possibility of disease progression. Expectant management of stage A1 disease is warranted but regular and long-term followup is mandatory. \nThe syndrome of alcoholic ketoacidosis. PURPOSE: To further elucidate the clinical spectrum of alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case series of 74 patients with AKA defined as a wide anion gap metabolic acidosis unexplained by any other disorder or toxin, including any patient with a history of chronic alcohol abuse. The setting was the Medical Emergency Department at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, a university-affiliated inner-city hospital. RESULTS: AKA is a common disorder in the emergency department, more common than previously thought. The acid-base abnormalities are more diverse than just a wide-gap metabolic acidosis and often include a concomitant metabolic alkalosis, hyperchloremic acidosis, or respiratory alkalosis. Lactic acidosis is also common. Semiquantitative serum acetoacetate levels were positive in 96% of patients. Elevated blood alcohol levels were present in two thirds of patients in whom alcohol levels were determined, and levels consistent with intoxication were seen in 40% of these patients. Electrolyte disorders including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia were common on presentation. The most common symptoms were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The most common physical findings were tachycardia, tachypnea, and abdominal tenderness. Altered mental status, fever, hypothermia, or other abnormal findings were uncommon and reflected other underlying processes. CONCLUSIONS: AKA is a common disorder in chronic malnourished alcoholic persons. The acid-base abnormalities reflect not only the ketoacidosis, but also associated extracellular fluid volume depletion, alcohol withdrawal, pain, sepsis, or severe liver disease. Although the pathophysiology is complex, the syndrome is rapidly reversible and has a low mortality. \nDistribution of the VLA family of integrins in normal and pathological human liver tissue. The \"very late activation\" (VLA) subgroup of the integrin superfamily of adhesion molecules plays a central role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The six different VLA dimers known so far consist of a common beta subunit and a variable alpha (1 to 6) subunit. They serve as receptors for laminin, collagen, and fibronectin or function as adhesion molecules for leukocytes and are therefore of great significance in embryogenesis, growth and repair, and in leukocyte recirculation. The distribution of the common beta and the variable alpha chains of the VLA were studied in normal, inflammatory, and cholestatic liver biopsy samples. In normal liver tissue, vascular endothelia express alpha 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; bile duct epithelium alpha 2, 3, 5, and 6; connective tissue stroma alpha 1 and 2; hepatocytes alpha 1 and 5; sinusoidal lining cells alpha 1, 2, and 5; and mononuclear cells alpha 4. Whereas bile ducts and vascular endothelia do not show relevant changes in alpha chain expression in liver diseases, hepatocytes de novo express membranous alpha 3 and 6 in inflammatory liver diseases. In view of the role of the VLA-3 and VLA-6 as laminin receptors, this finding is in line with the production of laminin in active liver disease. Moreover, de novo expression of \"bile duct type\" alpha 2, 3, and 6 on periportal hepatocytes in cholestatic liver disease likely illustrates a phenotypic switch of hepatocytes towards bile duct epithelium during cholestasis. \nChlamydia trachomatis induces an inflammatory response in the male genital tract and is associated with altered semen quality. U. urealyticum with 15.8% and C. trachomatis antibodies with 15.4% were the most prevalent microbiological findings in 209 male infertility patients. The inflammatory marker granulocyte-elastase was significantly increased in men with C. trachomatis; these men also showed significantly decreased citric acid levels indicating inflammatory damage of the prostate induced by C. trachomatis. \nAmnesia following damage to the left fornix and to other sites. A comparative study. Two memory-impaired patients, who had suffered damage to the left or both fornix columns during removal of a ventricular cyst, were compared with 3 others having left-sided hippocampal or thalamic lesions, and with normal controls. The tests used were nonverbal--scene recognition, delayed matching-to-sample and concurrent pattern and object discrimination learning. The last two are differentially sensitive to fornix transection and to hippocampal or thalamic ablations in monkeys; however, the patients with fornix damage did not show a distinctive pattern of impairment. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The study adds to the evidence that fornix transection can cause wide-ranging memory disturbances in man. \nExtent of mesiobasal resection determines outcome after temporal lobectomy for intractable complex partial seizures. The extent of resection was assessed in 94 patients who underwent temporal lobectomy for medically intractable complex partial seizures originating from a unilateral seizure focus in the anteromesial temporal lobe. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the coronal plane was used to quantify the extent of resection of lateral and mesiobasal structures according to a 20-compartment model of the temporal lobe. Successful seizure outcome (greater than or equal to 90% reduction in seizure frequency) was accomplished in 83% of the patients (all followed up for more than 1 year; mean duration of follow-up, 25.2 months) and correlated significantly (P less than 0.05) with the extent of mesiobasal resection, regardless of the extent of resection of lateral structures. Successful seizure outcome was accomplished in 81% of the patients with no structural lesions, and also correlated significantly (P less than 0.05) with the extent of mesiobasal resection regardless of the extent of lateral resection. A successful seizure outcome was accomplished in 90% of the 21 patients with structural lesions documented by neuroimaging studies. Two patients who underwent extensive lobectomy without resection of the structural lesion had no reduction in seizure frequency postoperatively. We conclude that the most important factor in determining the outcome of temporal lobectomy in patients with unilateral anteromesial temporal lobe epileptogenicity is the extent of resection of structures in the mesiobasal temporal lobe. In patients with structural lesions, lesion resection may be an added contributor to successful seizure outcome. \nPreoperative clinical evaluation as a predictor of cardiac complications after infrarenal aortic reconstruction. This paper analyses cardiac risk factors in 93 consecutive patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction over a 2 year period. During the perioperative or postoperative period, 26 patients sustained a total of 42 cardiac complications. Eight patients had myocardial infarction, 14 left ventricular failure and 15 arrhythmias. There were five cardiac-related deaths. Angina was the only statistically significant risk factor in predicting postoperative cardiac problems. A multivariate analysis identified a high-risk group of patients in whom cardiac complications after operation were common. \nHydroa vacciniforme with unusually severe scar formation: diagnosis by repetitive UVA phototesting. Hydroa vacciniforme is a rare, chronic, photosensitive disorder manifested in childhood by recurrent vesicles that heal with scarring. Reproduction of vesicles with repetitive UVA phototesting may be an important diagnostic aid. Recurrent eruption resulted in severe scarring of the face and a flexion contracture of the finger in our patient. The clinical features and laboratory evaluation of hydroa vacciniforme are reviewed. \nPenetration of erythromycin into periapical lesions after repeated doses of erythromycin acistrate and erythromycin stearate: a pilot study. In 26 patients who had undergone apicectomy and extirpation of granulomas (n = 9) or radicular cysts (n = 17), concentrations of erythromycin, 2'-acetyl erythromycin, and their anhydro forms were determined with a novel chemical method in plasma and periapical lesions after at least 2 days of treatment with erythromycin acistrate (EA) (400 mg three times daily, n = 11) or erythromycin stearate (ES) (500 mg three times daily, n = 15). Oral surgery was performed 2 1/2 to 3 hours after the last dose. Blood samples were collected at the time of operation, and immediately before antibiotic treatment, and 1, 2, and 6 hours after treatment. At all time points EA produced at least twice the total antibiotic (2'-acetyl erythromycin plus erythromycin) concentrations in plasma as ES. Erythromycin levels in plasma were at least as high after EA treatment as after ES. In periapical lesions erythromycin concentration after EA was three times higher (1.34 +/- 0.28 micrograms/gm) than after ES treatment (0.40 +/- 0.17 micrograms/gm). Although the total drug concentration in periapical lesions was about the same after EA (2.64 micrograms/ml) and ES (3.41 micrograms/ml), most of the drug recovered after ES was antimicrobially inactive anhydroerythromycin (3.01 micrograms/gm). The concentration of anhydroerythromycin in plasma was approximately the same as that of erythromycin after ES throughout the dose interval. After EA treatment both plasma and the periapical lesion samples contained hardly detectable amounts of anhydroerythromycin. Hence EA has a good bioavailability essential for treatment and prophylaxis of bacterial infections in dentistry. \nThe ventilatory threshold: method, protocol, and evaluator agreement. To evaluate the effects of different methods of detection, exercise modes, protocols, and reviewers on oxygen uptake (VO2) at the ventilatory threshold (ATge), 17 men with heart disease (mean age 59 +/- 6 years) and six healthy men (mean age 60 +/- 11 years) underwent six exercise tests on different days. Each subject performed three treadmill tests (Bruce, Balke, and ramp) and three bicycle ergometer tests (50 W/stage, 25 W/stage, and ramp) in random order. The ventilatory threshold was determined for each of the six exercise tests by three independent, blinded reviewers by means of graphic plots of three commonly used methods of determination: (1) changes in the ventilatory equivalents for VO2 and VCO2, (2) changes in end-tidal oxygen and carbon dioxide pressures, and (3) the intersection of the slope of VCO2 and VO2 (V slope). The largest variability in the ATge was observed with changes in the exercise protocol. The greatest absolute (ml/min) and percentage differences in oxygen uptake at the ATge as a result of changes in protocol, method of determination, and observers were 336 (36%), 125 (12%), and 70 (7%), respectively. The overall intraclass correlation coefficient for VO2 at the ATge among the three reviewers was 0.60 and among the three protocols was 0.85 (p less than 0.01). The V slope method of detection had consistently good agreement among reviewers and was least affected by the protocol. The variance in the ATge (excluding intersubject and error variance) accounted for by differences in protocol, method, and reviewer was 82%, 14%, and 4%, respectively. \nBacterial infection as a complication of liver transplantation: epidemiology and risk factors. A retrospective survey was undertaken to characterize the epidemiology of bacterial infection in 79 patients who underwent 103 operations for orthotopic liver transplantation. Fifty-four patients (68%) developed 115 bacterial infections (1.46 episodes per patient), and seven patients died as a result of these infections. Fifty-three percent of bacterial infections occurred within 2 weeks after transplantation and were designated as early infections. The most common sites of infection were the abdomen (35 cases), the bloodstream (31 cases), and the surgical wound (19 cases). Aerobic enteric gram-negative bacilli were the predominant pathogens, and other pathogenic organisms were enterococci, staphylococci, and Pseudomonas bacteria. Logistic regression analysis identified prolonged duration of surgery (greater than or equal to 8 hours) and an elevated bilirubin level (greater than or equal to 12 mg/dL) as risk factors for early bacterial infection at any site; risk factors for abdominal or wound infection were prolonged duration of surgery, increased operative transfusion requirement (greater than or equal to 2 blood volumes), and prior hepatobiliary surgery. Awareness of the sites, pathogens, and time of onset of bacterial infection provides a basis for improved prophylaxis and empiric therapy. \nRoentgenographic dimensions of the upper airway in snoring patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a simple test, such as routine roentgenographic views of the upper airway, is useful in identifying anatomic narrowing of the airway in patients with sleep apnea. To accomplish this, we prospectively studied a group of 117 patients (95 male and 22 female subjects) referred for evaluation of heavy snoring and possible obstructive sleep apnea. All patients had full nocturnal polysomnography, including measurements of snoring. Lateral view of the airway obtained after swallowing contrast material was used to measure pharyngeal diameters at three sites along the airway. All measurements were performed with the patients standing and supine. We used three different definitions of sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index of 10, 20, and 40), and compared airway diameters between the apneic and nonapneic snorers. Only when sleep apnea was defined as greater than 40 apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep was there a significant difference in airway diameter at the tip of the palate and 1 cm distal to it between apneic and nonapneic snorers. Both groups of patients demonstrated a significant reduction in the retropalatal distance on assumption of the supine posture. Stepwise, forward, multiple linear regression analysis showed that the retropalatal distance and airway diameter at the tip of the palate and 1 cm distal to it were significant predictors of snoring, but not apnea. We conclude that (1) airway diameters account for some of the variability in snoring, and (2) they do not differentiate between apneic and nonapneic snorers. \nRandomized study of vancomycin versus teicoplanin for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections in immunocompromised hosts. Seventy-four immunocompromised patients with severe infection due to gram-positive organisms were randomized to receive either vancomycin or teicoplanin. Extensive cancer was present in 71 patients, of whom 47 died within a month. The types of infections were 46 bacteremias (39 associated with central catheters), 24 skin and soft tissue infections (3 with bacteremia), and 7 others (mainly bronchopneumonia). The most frequent pathogen was Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Staphylococcus aureus. Microbiological eradication was obtained in 23 of 35 evaluable patients treated with vancomycin (65.7%) and 28 of 36 patients treated with teicoplanin (77.8%) (P = 0.4). Clinical cure and improvement were obtained in 26 of 35 patients (74.3%) and 27 of 36 patients (75.0%), respectively. No significant side effects were observed with teicoplanin, in contrast to reversible increases in serum creatinine (three patients) and skin rashes (four patients) with vancomycin. Superinfection was observed in five patients treated with vancomycin and two patients treated with teicoplanin. No relation was found between peak concentration in serum (at steady state) or bactericidal titers and outcome. \nImmunocytochemical analysis of the cellular infiltrate in primary regressing and non-regressing malignant melanoma. Spontaneous regression occurs in a small proportion of malignant melanomas, and it is important to understand the processes involved in its induction as this may give a guide to future therapies for this disease. We have examined 36 primary malignant melanomas (19 regressing, 17 non-regressing) and identified the cellular phenotypes and activation states of the cells infiltrating regressing and non-regressing primary melanomas by immunochemistry. We have found a significantly increased number of CD3-positive cells and an increased ratio of CD4/CD8-positive cells infiltrating regressing compared to non-regressing tumors. In addition, the expression of the interleukin 2 receptor, an activation marker for T cells, was increased. However, there were no significant differences in class II MHC, CD1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), or melanoma-associated differentiation-antigen expression in these tumors. These data are consistent with melanoma regression being induced by activated CD4 T cells and do not seem to be related to the differentiation markers we have examined on these tumors. \nElective cholecystectomy and carcinoma of the gallbladder. The incidence of carcinoma of the gallbladder has been reputed to be approximately 1.5 per cent among those who undergo surgery for chronic cholecystitis. The incidence at Cabrini Medical Center coincides rather well with that from other studies but has shown a marked decline, 21.5 per cent, within recent years. A report from the American Cancer Society projects an even greater decline to 0.65 per cent in the incidence of this almost incurable disease within the next 1-2 years. The decrease in the incidence of cancer of the gallbladder is attributed to the great increase in the performance of elective cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis among people 50 years of age or younger, before they have reached the age when carcinoma of the gallbladder is most prevalent. Early surgery is advocated not only as an effective and safe form of therapy but also as a valuable preventive measure. \nA geriatric-anesthesiologic program to reduce acute confusional states in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a geriatric-anesthesiologic intervention program for the prevention and treatment of acute confusional states (ACS) in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures. The intervention program was based on the results of previous prospective studies in similar patient populations. The outcome of the intervention, comprising 103 patients, was compared with that of an earlier study comprising 111 patients. The intervention program consisted of pre- and post-operative geriatric assessments, oxygen therapy, early surgery, prevention and treatment of peri-operative blood pressure falls and treatment of post-operative complications. The incidence of ACS was lower, 47.6%, in the intervention study compared with 61.3% (P less than 0.05) in the control study. Furthermore, the ACS that occurred in the intervention study was less severe and of shorter duration than that in the control study. The incidence of post-operative decubital ulcers, severe falls, and urinary retention was also lower. The mean duration of orthopedic ward stay was 17.4 days in the control study and 11.6 days in the intervention study (P less than 0.001). It can be concluded that the intervention program reduced the incidence, severity, and duration of ACS which resulted in a shortened orthopedic ward stay. \nCardiac function after hepatic ischemia-anoxia and reperfusion injury: a new experimental model. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: During liver transplantation, reperfusion of the donor liver and in the clinical setting, end-stage liver disease, have occasionally resulted in profound cardiovascular disturbances. The etiology of hepatic injury-induced myocardial dysfunction is still unclear. In this study, the aims were to develop an experimental model that would facilitate the study of the effects of hepatic failure on myocardial function and to determine whether hepatic ischemia or anoxia and reperfusion injury of similar duration would result in the same degree of hepatic failure. Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats were used as organ donors. Three simultaneous liver-heart perfusions (corresponding to three groups) were established using a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer with 2% bovine albumin, membrane oxygenation, and a peristaltic pump. Group 1 (n = 10) and group 2 (n = 15) experiments consisted of liver-heart perfusions after 90 mins of normothermic hepatic ischemia or 90 mins of hepatic anoxia, respectively, followed by reoxygenation and 60 mins of reperfusion. Group 3 (n = 8) experiments consisted of sham liver-heart perfusions studied over the same experimental time period (60 mins). Myocardial function variables, liver function tests, arterial blood gases, and electrolytes were measured at baseline and at 3-, 10-, 30-, and 60-min intervals during reperfusion in all experiments. RESULTS: Ischemia or anoxia-induced hepatic failure resulted in a similar degree of hepatic dysfunction. Both forms of acute hepatic failure caused significant increases in liver function tests, a reduction in heart rate (p less than .05), coronary flow (p less than .05), and an increase in calculated coronary vascular resistance (p less than .05). There were no changes in buffer pH, CO2, or ionized calcium that could explain the coronary vasoconstriction. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic dysfunction induced by ischemia or anoxia of similar duration results in a similar hepatic metabolic profile during reperfusion and can cause direct myocardial dysfunction of the isolated perfused rat heart. \nComplications of infection and immunologic status after surgery for patients with esophageal cancer. Correlations between defective cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and infections following surgery for esophageal cancer were evaluated. Peripheral lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, PHA transformation, and PPD skin test were measured in 81 patients with esophageal cancer, 58 with gastric cancer, and 50 healthy controls. The depression of CMI was predominant to a similar extent in patients with esophageal cancer and in those with gastric cancer. The average level of PHA transformation immediately before surgery was significantly lower in the esophageal cancer patients with fatal septic complications than in those without such problems. Although preoperative radiation therapy markedly depressed the levels of the four parameters, this association was also noted in 28 patients not given radiation. It thus appears that PHA transformation may be valuable in the prediction of fatal septic complications after major surgery in patients with esophageal cancer. \nImpact of two cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with intraarterial cisplatin and intravenous doxorubicin on the choice of surgical procedure for high-grade bone sarcomas of the extremities. The authors assessed the impact of two cycles of preoperative chemotherapy (POCT) with intraarterial cisplatin (120 mg/m2) and continuous intravenous doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin; 20 mg/m2/day x 3 days) on the decision to perform a limb-sparing procedure (LSP) or amputation in 22 patients with high-grade bone sarcomas of the extremities. The tumor types were osteosarcoma (17), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (three), leiomyosarcoma (one), and malignant schwannoma (one). Surgical stages were IIA (three), IIB (17), and IIIB (two). The prechemotherapy surgical options chosen were 12 amputations (55% of patients) and ten LSPs (45%). The initial decisions to amputate were based on a combination of the following: improper biopsy (five cases), large tumors (ten) and those with neurovascular encroachment (six), and pathological fracture (one). Following chemotherapy, 18 LSPs (81%) and four amputations (19%) were performed. Nine of 12 patients (75%) initially deemed unresectable were converted to LSP. The median tumor response (necrosis; range, 0%-100%) was 70%; ten of 22 specimens had necrosis greater than 95%. Median tumor necrosis for the patients treated by amputation and LSPs was 45% and 88%, respectively. Following surgery, all patients received four additional cycles of cisplatin and doxorubicin. The median follow-up period is 30 months; six patients have developed metastatic disease, with a median disease-free interval of 16.6 months. The rate of local tumor control is 95% (21 of 22 patients). \nPrevalence and treatment of giardiasis in chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition. To determine the prevalence of giardiasis in Gambian children with chronic diarrhoea and to assess their response to treatment, 31 children with chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition were investigated for giardiasis using a combination of serology (specific antigiardia IgM antibody) and microscopy of faeces and jejunal biopsy specimens. Fourteen of 31 children with chronic diarrhoea had giardiasis compared with only four of 33 healthy age and sex matched control children. Four of 15 malnourished children without diarrhoea were giardia positive. Twenty-three children with chronic diarrhoea were reinvestigated after treatment with metronidazole; giardia was found in 11 of them. These results show that giardia is highly prevalent in children with chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition and that the infection does not respond to standard therapeutic measures. \nCardiac toxicity 4 to 20 years after completing anthracycline therapy. OBJECTIVE.--To assess the cardiac status of long-term survivors of pediatric malignancies who received chemotherapy, including anthracyclines. DESIGN AND METHOD.-Patients were evaluated by echocardiogram from 4 to 20 years (median, 7 years) after completion of anthracyclines, with prospective and retrospective analysis. PATIENTS.--The consecutive sample of 201 patients had received a total anthracycline dose of 200 to 1275 mg/m2 (median, 450 mg/m2), and 51 patients had mediastinal radiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The overall incidence and severity of abnormal systolic cardiac function were determined for the entire cohort. Risk factors of total anthracycline dose, mediastinal radiotherapy, age during treatment, and length of follow-up were examined. RESULTS.--Twenty-three percent (47/201) of the cohort had abnormal cardiac function on noninvasive testing at long-term follow-up. Correlation between total cumulative dose, length of follow-up, and mediastinal irradiation with incidence of abnormalities was significant. Fifty-six patients were followed up for 10 years or more (median, 12 years), with a median anthracycline dose of 495 mg/m2. Thirty-eight percent (21/56) of these patients, compared with 18% (26/145) of patients evaluated after less than 10 years, had abnormal findings. Sixty-three percent of patients followed up for 10 years or more after receiving 500 mg/m2 or more of anthracyclines had abnormal findings. Nine of 201 patients had late symptoms, including cardiac failure and dysrhythmia, and three patients died suddenly. Microscopic examination of the myocardium on biopsy and autopsy revealed fibrosis. CONCLUSION.--The 23% incidence of late cardiac abnormalities warrants continued evaluation of patients after anthracyclines to guide patient care and the design of future chemotherapeutic protocols. \nCarcinomatous meningitis: antibody-guided therapy with I-131 HMFG1. Seven patients with carcinomatous meningitis were administered intrathecal I-131 labelled monoclonal antibody HMFG1. Clinical responses were seen in two patients, with a long term survivor at 32 months. Aseptic meningitis occurred in 4/7 patients, but more serious toxicity was observed in the form of seizures (2/7 patients) and myelosuppression (3/7 patients). Partial obliteration of the subarachnoid space was identified as a potential problem in patients with advanced disease. \nComputer-assisted superimposition of magnetic resonance and high-resolution technetium-99m-HMPAO and thallium-201 SPECT images of the brain. A method for registering three-dimensional CT, MR, and PET data sets that require no special patient immobilization or other precise positioning measures was adapted to high-resolution SPECT and MRI and was applied in 14 subjects (five normal volunteers, four patients with dementia",
