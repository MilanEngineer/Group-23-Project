        "text": "s between T-cell ALL cases with or without the t(11;14), leukemic cells from patients with the translocations were more likely to coexpress CD4 and CD8 antigens (6 of 6 v 35 of 86 cases tested, P less than .05). Adverse events have occurred in six patients: three central nervous system relapses [including the one with t(11;14)(p15;q11)], two secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and one hematologic relapse. Our results indicate that the t(11;14)(p13;q11) occurs exclusively in T-cell malignancies of intermediate- or late-stage thymocyte differentiation. Additional studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of these translocations. \nImpaired binding properties of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease. To determine the factors underlying the apparent reduction in binding ability of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma, hormone-binding characteristics were further examined in patients with this disease and in control subjects. No differences in affinity constants with respect to triodothyronine or serum thyroxine-binding globulin from hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhotic and normal subjects were found. The affinity for thyroxine was significantly reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (0.41 +/- 0.13 x 10(10) mol-1) and cirrhotic (0.65 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) mol-1) patients compared with normal subjects (0.94 +/- 0.7 x 10(10) mol-1). Investigations carried out on liver tissue obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease showed that thyroxine-binding globulin within tumor tissue was elevated and bound less exogenous tracer hormone compared with that obtained from nontumor tissue. Tumor-derived thyroxine-binding globulin with altered binding properties is, at least partly, responsible for the abnormal behavior of the serum protein in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. \nParenchymal versus reticuloendothelial iron overload in the liver: distinction with MR imaging Parenchymal iron deposition occurs in hemochromatosis, while iron is deposited in reticuloendothelial (RE) cells after blood transfusions or rhabdomyolysis. Magnetic resonance images of patients with decreased liver signal intensity on T2-weighted images at 1.5 T were blindly compared in an effort to distinguish these conditions. In each of five patients with hemochromatosis, the pancreas had low signal intensity, but splenic signal intensity was decreased in only one. In contrast, only three of the 16 patients with RE iron overload had low pancreatic signal intensity, while all of these patients either had low splenic signal intensity (n = 14) or previously underwent splenectomy (n = 2). Distinction among these causes of iron deposition is clinically important because parenchymal iron overload from hemochromatosis may produce significant tissue damage, while the RE iron of transfusions and rhabdomyolysis is of little clinical consequence. \nLong-term follow-up of elderly patients with locoregional breast cancer treated with tamoxifen only. One hundred and thirteen women aged 70 years or more with locoregional breast cancer were treated with tamoxifen alone as primary treatment. They were followed for a minimum of 5 years. Complete response occurred in 38 women, partial response in 17, no change in 34 and progressive disease in 24. Where progressive disease occurred, or where patients relapsed after an initial response, the most suitable conventional therapy was given. The actuarial 5-year survival rate was 49.4 per cent for all patients and was much higher (92 per cent) in those showing an initial complete response. Seventy patients (61.9 per cent) were not controlled by tamoxifen alone to death or most recent follow-up. Tamoxifen provides an alternative treatment for operable breast cancer in older women in the short term and may be particularly suitable for those with concurrent disease or who are unwilling to undergo surgery. The low morbidity rate from tamoxifen must be balanced against the need to maintain close follow-up. In the medium to long term, sole primary treatment by tamoxifen delays more definitive therapy. \nStability of ethnic differences in children's pressor responses during three annual examinations. In this study, 395 healthy children had blood pressure and heart rate measured both at rest and during a stressful video game. Identical measurement procedures were used for three annual examinations. Consistently, black children demonstrated significantly greater pressor responses than white children. In view of the greater prevalence of hypertension among black adults than white adults, these data suggest that blacks exhibit hemodynamic irregularities well before the onset or diagnosis of hypertension. \nAdrenoceptors on blood cells from patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. 1. alpha 2-Adrenoceptors on platelet membranes and beta 2-adrenoceptors on lymphocytes were studied in 24 patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and in 24 age- and sex-matched control subjects. In two subgroups, a standardized mental arithmetic test and a finger-cooling test were performed. 2. Baseline blood pressure, heart rate and forearm blood flow did not differ between the two groups. 3. Baseline skin microcirculation (laser Doppler flux) was decreased in primary Raynaud's phenomenon (19 +/- 15 arbitrary units) compared with control subjects (33 +/- 14 arbitrary units) (P less than 0.01). 4. Baseline plasma noradrenaline concentration (2.00 +/- 1.44 versus 1.16 +/- 0.36 nmol/l) and alpha 2-adrenoceptor density (301 +/- 119 versus 210 +/- 82 fmol/mg) were increased in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon in comparison with the control subjects. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor density/beta 2-adrenoceptor density ratio in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon was, with a value of 0.37 +/- 0.04, higher than in the control subjects, where a value of 0.25 +/- 0.02 was measured (P less than 0.001). Plasma adrenaline concentration, beta 2-adrenoceptor density and the antagonist affinity to both receptor subtypes did not differ between both groups under baseline conditions. 5. Whereas during the finger-cooling test no differences were seen in the responses of the parameters measured, the mental arithmetic test induced an increase in laser Doppler flux in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and a decrease in the control group. \nVariation in management based on type of choledochal cyst. The management of 23 patients treated for choledochal cysts at the Oregon Health Sciences University between 1969 and 1990 is reviewed. The median age was 27 years, with a range from 1 month to 90 years. Seventy-eight percent of patients presented with abdominal pain, and 35% were jaundiced. Three patients presented with cholangitis, two with cyst rupture, and one with recurrent pancreatitis. Nine patients had had previous biliary surgery. The diagnosis was made in all patients with ultrasound and/or cholangiography. Fifteen patients (65%) had type I cysts, 2 had a type II cyst, 5 (22%) had type III cysts, and 1 had a type IV cyst. Stones were present in four (17%) cysts, and all excised cysts were benign. Seventeen patients with type I and II choledochal cysts had complete cyst excision and choledochoenterostomy. Four of five patients with type III cysts had endoscopic cyst incision and drainage, while the fifth patient had transduodenal cyst excision and sphincteroplasty. The patient with a type IV cyst had extrahepatic cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy. There were no operative deaths. Two postoperative complications occurred: cholangitis and a prolonged ileus. All patients had resolution of their pain and jaundice. Two patients had late cholangitis. Cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy are the treatment of choice for types I and II choledochal cysts. Extrahepatic cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy may be adequate treatment for type IV cysts. Endoscopic incision and drainage is appropriate for selected patients with type III cysts. \nCharacterization of infectious crystalline keratitis caused by a human isolate of Streptococcus mitis. Streptococcus mitis isolated from a human with infectious crystalline keratitis was injected intrastromally into corneas of adult New Zealand white rabbits that were treated with tetracycline hydrochloride, methylprednisolone acetate, or a combination of tetracycline and methylprednisolone. Animals were followed up for up to 44 days; untreated corneas and those treated with tetracycline developed no disease or \"fluffy\" stromal infiltrates with overlying epithelial defects representing an abscess. Corneas treated with the combination of tetracycline and corticosteroid usually developed crystalline stromal opacities that on histopathologic examination were shown to be intrastromal aggregates of cocci. Transmission electron microscopy of crystalline lesions within 10 days of infection revealed typical cocci intermixed with a fibrillar material having periodicity characteristic of fibrinogen or fibrin, and immunoperoxidase staining for fibrinogen was positive. By 1 month, electron microscopy revealed aggregates of degenerated bacteria that were surrounded by cellular processes of activated keratocytes. Our studies demonstrate a model for crystalline keratitis in which organisms are seen to reside within the stroma for up to 44 days without an inflammatory response. Periocular corticosteroids appear to be necessary to create this model. It is possible that the organisms are isolated from the host response by fibrin or by keratocytes. \nApplication of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in infants and small children. Intraoperative echocardiography is gaining increasing acceptance in the assessment of the surgical repair of congenital heart defects. Because of its ideal imaging location, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been especially helpful in evaluating pulmonary venous return and the integrity of the left atrioventricular valve following mitral valvuloplasty, complete atrioventricular valve repair and correction of complex congenital heart disease. It has not been routinely used in infants and small children because of a prohibitively large probe size. We report the successful use of a recently developed \"pediatric\" TEE probe capable of Doppler and color flow imaging in two patients less than 7 years of age. No complications were encountered. Recommendations regarding optimal probe imaging positions in infants are provided. \nCurrent treatment of patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Most out-of-hospital cardiac arrests result from the sudden onset of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia in the absence of a new myocardial infarction. Individuals who survive cardiac arrest are at high risk for recurrent arrhythmias and sudden unexpected death. To prevent recurrent cardiac arrest, effective treatment must be provided during hospitalization after the initial episode. Caring for the survivor of cardiac arrest requires a detailed clinical investigation to define the underlying cardiac anatomy and left ventricular function and to elucidate the mechanism and characteristics of the patient's arrhythmia. Appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy, such as drugs or a nonpharmacological intervention (eg, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), is then selected based on these considerations. In addition, ischemia is treated aggressively with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and, when appropriate, with surgical coronary artery revascularization. \nTissue polypeptide antigen activity in cerebrospinal fluid: a marker of central nervous system metastases of breast cancer. Tissue polypeptide antigen (TPpA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured in 59 consecutive breast cancer patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subsequently, we determined that 13 patients had parenchymal brain metastases, 10 had leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and 36 had no CNS involvement. The concentration of TPpA, which is a nonspecific marker for cell proliferation, was significantly higher in patients with CNS metastases than in those without it (P less than .0001; Mann-Whitney test). A tentative cutoff value for CNS metastases was set at 95 U/L TPpA; the upper limit of values indicating absence of CNS metastases was 89 U/L. Given these cutoff points, the sensitivity of TPpA as a marker for CNS metastases was 74% and the specificity was 100%; the predictive values of positive and negative tests were 100% and 86%, respectively. In 16 patients with CNS metastases, no correlation was found between TPpA activity in corresponding CSF and blood samples (correlation coefficient, Spearman's rho = .4; P greater than .1). In three patients treated for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the measurements of CSF TPpA showed correlation between the presence of tumor cells in the CSF and neurological clinical function. TPpA concentrations decreased in parallel with the clinical response and increased prior to CNS disease progression. As a marker for CNS metastases, the level of TPpA in the CSF in breast cancer patients appears to be superior to the level of protein, lactate dehydrogenase, or glucose, which showed very low sensitivity (41%, 47%, and 8%, respectively). For quantitative evaluation of treatment for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the TPpA level appears to be valuable and superior to CSF cytology, because tumor cells are not always present in CSF samples from patients with this condition. \nRoles of thrombin and platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in platelet-subendothelial deposition after angioplasty in an ex vivo whole artery model. BACKGROUND. Platelet deposition at the site of injury caused by balloon angioplasty is associated with acute closure and restenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. In a new ex vivo whole artery angioplasty model, we examined the roles of thrombin inhibition with D-Phe-Pro-ArgCH2Cl (PPACK) and inhibition of the platelet membrane fibrinogen receptor glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) with monoclonal antibody 7E3 on platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury. Fresh rabbit aortas were mounted in a perfusion chamber. One half of the mounted arterial segment was dilated with a standard angioplasty balloon catheter and the uninjured half served as the control segment. The vessels were perfused with human blood at physiological pressure and shear rates of 180-250 second-1 for 30 minutes. Platelet deposition was measured using 111In-labeled platelets and scanning electron microscopy. With heparin (2 units/ml) anticoagulation, 8.2 +/- 2.2 x 10(6) platelets/cm2 were deposited at the site of balloon injury compared with 0.7 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) platelets/cm2 on uninjured segments (p less than 0.02, n = 7). PPACK was tested at a concentration (10 microM) that totally inhibited platelet aggregation in response to thrombin. 7E3 was tested at a concentration (10 micrograms/ml) that totally inhibited platelet aggregation. Platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury was reduced 47% by PPACK and 70% by 7E3 compared with heparin. CONCLUSIONS. At shear rates seen in nonstenotic coronary arteries, PPACK and 7E3 are more effective than heparin in reducing platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury. The significant inhibition of platelet deposition by PPACK demonstrates the importance of heparin-resistant thrombin in platelet thrombus formation. The 7E3 results suggest that approximately 70% of platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury is GPIIb/IIIa dependent and that the remaining 30% results from non-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated platelet-subendothelial adhesion. Finally, the ex vivo whole artery system is a useful model for studying platelet-vessel wall interactions under physiologically defined parameters. \nMycotic (Aspergillus) arteritis resulting in fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a case report. A seventy-one year-old Japanese man suffering from carcinoma of the common bile duct died from subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary in intracranial mycotic arteritis (MA). Repeated cultures of the discharge from the draining tubes, the tip of intravenous hyperalimentation catheters, blood, sputum, and urine failed to grow any fungus. Autopsy disclosed MA due to Aspergillus at the terminal portion of the right internal carotid artery close to the posterior communicating artery. \nInhibitory effect of interleukin-4 on the in vitro growth of Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. We investigated the effect of recombinant human interleukin-4 (rhIL-4) on the in vitro growth of human leukemia cells in liquid culture and 3H-thymidine incorporation and found inhibitory effects on the growth of leukemic cells from patients with Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph1 ALL) and three Ph1 ALL cell lines. However, no inhibitory effects were seen in Ph1-positive leukemic cell lines derived from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis and various types of Ph1-negative leukemia cells, including B-lineage leukemia cells. In a flow cytometry assay of IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), all three Ph1-positive ALL cell lines showed the presence of IL-4R on their cell surfaces, and the IL-4-dependent inhibition on the growth of Ph1-positive ALL cells was abrogated by the addition of either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against rhIL-4. Other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-CSF, and IL-6, showed no inhibitory effects on the growth of Ph1-ALL cells, but tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon (IFN)-alpha, -beta, and -gamma displayed slight inhibitory effects in a high concentration. The growth inhibition induced by rhIL-4 in the Ph1-positive ALL cells was not abrogated by the addition of antibodies against either IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha. Furthermore, these cells showed no significant production of IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma or TNF-alpha after exposure to rhIL-4, thus indicating that the growth inhibition of Ph1-positive ALL cells by rhIL-4 is not associated with IL-4-stimulating production of these factors. rhIL-4 caused significant inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity in these Ph1-positive ALL cells, similar to Herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase that inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity in these cells. Our finding suggests that the clinical evaluation of rhIL-4 may offer promising therapeutic possibilities for patients with Ph1-positive ALL. \nAztreonam vs. cefotaxime in the treatment of gram-negative spontaneous peritonitis in cirrhotic patients. Aztreonam and cefotaxime were compared in 44 cirrhotic patients who had 52 episodes of gram-negative spontaneous peritonitis. Patients were randomized into two therapeutic groups of similar characteristics. Group A (28 episodes) received 0.5 gm of aztreonam every 8 hr, and group B (24 episodes) received 1 gm of cefotaxime every 6 hr, for a planned 14-day period. Peak and trough serum and ascitic fluid levels of both antibiotics were several times higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations of causative microorganisms. Eleven patients (21%) died within the first 48 hr after beginning therapy, which included seven in the aztreonam group and four in the cefotaxime group. In the remaining patients, signs and symptoms of infection were promptly controlled, and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr in all cases, except in one patient from the aztreonam group, who was a clinical failure. Two patients from the aztreonam group and one from the cefotaxime group relapsed after treatment. The overall mortality rate was 50%, which was lower than classically reported: 12 patients (43%) died in the aztreonam group, and 14 (58%) died in the cefotaxime group (p = 0.265, NS). Hepatorenal syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage were the most frequent causes of death occurring after the first 48 hr of treatment. Streptococcal superinfections developed in three patients (14.2%) in the aztreonam group. We conclude that both antibiotics at the low doses used in this study are similarly well tolerated and effective in controlling this infection. Because the use of aztreonam as the initial empirical treatment requires a concomitant antibiotic against gram-positive infections and the possibility of streptococcal superinfections, cefotaxime seems to be a more advantageous therapeutic alternative for this patient population. \nEffects of posture, Valsalva maneuver and respiration on atrial flutter rate: an effect mediated through cardiac volume. The effects of passive upright tilting from 0 degrees to +60 degrees (n = 27), Valsalva maneuver (n = 16) and respiration (n = 10) on the rate of atrial flutter were studied in 27 patients. After tilting to +60 degrees, the atrial flutter cycle length shortened in all patients from 247.5 +/- 7 to 236.7 +/- 6.9 ms (range of shortening 1 to 21 ms, p less than 0.001). The Valsalva maneuver (strain of 40 mm Hg) shortened the flutter cycle length during the strain (phase 2) from 242.2 +/- 4.6 to 230.5 +/- 5 ms (range of shortening 2 to 19 ms, p less than 0.001). In 10 patients whose respiration was monitored, the flutter cycle length consistently prolonged during inspiration and shortened during expiration. Combined beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor blockade in six patients did not significantly alter the flutter cycle length at rest or the effects of the various maneuvers on the changes in flutter cycle length. This study revealed that the atrial flutter cycle length can be shortened by passive upright tilting, the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver and expiration. Changes in flutter cycle length were independent of autonomic tone, implying that by decreasing cardiac volume, these maneuvers affect characteristics of the atrial flutter circuit, thereby producing dynamic changes in the rate of atrial flutter. \nTwo cases of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with myelopathy. We describe two patients with autopsy-proven neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) presenting only as a transverse myelopathy for 10 to 12 months, followed by disseminated intracranial manifestations. Postmortem examination disclosed a vasculocentric distribution of neoplastic cells in various organs that stained positively with B-lymphocyte-specific monoclonal antibody. These cases were unusual because they manifested as an isolated myelopathy for many months. \nDNA ploidy and cell kinetic measurements as predictors of recurrence and survival in stages B2 and C colorectal adenocarcinoma. DNA content and cell proliferation were measured by flow cytometry on paraffin-embedded Stage B2 or C colorectal adenocarcinomas from 694 patients enrolled in adjuvant trials conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Patients with diploid tumors had a higher survival rate than those with nondiploid tumors (P less than 0.001). The proliferation index (the sum of the percent of cells in S-phase plus those in G2M phase) was also a strong prognostic factor (P less than 0.001). The ploidy and proliferation data were combined, and the patients in the favorable group (diploid and low proliferative index) had a 5-year survival of 74% compared with 54% for the unfavorable group (high proliferative index or nondiploid, P less than 0.001). This grouping was prognostic for survival in B2 (P less than 0.001), C (P = 0.013), colon (P less than 0.001), and rectal (P = 0.026) patient subsets. This study indicates that cell kinetic parameters are important and independent prognostic factors for Stages B2 and C colorectal cancer. \nPoststenotic dilatation. Partial narrowing of arteries produces poststenotic dilatation. This appears as a dilation of the vessel wall 1 to 3 centimeters distal to the area of a partial stenosis. When a stenotic band is placed in dogs, poststenotic dilatation develops rapidly, often within eight to ten days. Moderate stenoses that produce a bruit and thrill are effective in eliciting poststenotic dilatation, whereas very tight and very mild stenoses usually are ineffective. Thus, development of poststenotic dilatation requires the presence of flow disturbances sufficient to produce an audible bruit and a palpable thrill. Although the exact flow disturbance is uncertain, statis, increased lateral pressure, cavitation, abnormal shear stresses and turbulence all have been postulated to be the cause of poststenotic dilatation. Of these, experimental studies support abnormal shear stresses and turbulence as the most likely causes. Whatever the flow disturbance, it must make the wall vibrate to produce poststenotic dilatation. Vibrations are thought to produce alterations in wall elastin and possibly in vascular smooth muscle tone. This leads to dilatation of the vessel. If the dilatation is slight, removal of the stenosis may cause reversal of poststenotic dilatation with recovery beginning within hours of correction of the stenosis. If the dilated area is enlarged to twice normal diameter, it may exhibit permanent aneurysmal changes and, therefore, requires resections with reanastomosis. Arteries that are dilated to as little as one-third more than normal size may contain areas of ulceration with overlying thrombus. These vessels also may require resection with reanastomosis. \nThe effects of shoes on the torsion and rearfoot motion in running. Excessive pronation is accepted as a good indicator for various running injuries. The least amount of pronation takes place when running barefoot. The latest investigations show that this is connected to a large torsional movement between forefoot and rearfoot which can be influenced by the shoe sole construction. The shoes which are in use among runners in track and field are basically of two types, running shoes (in general torsionally stiff) and spikes (torsionally flexible). The possibly varying effect of these shoes on the shoe/foot motion in running is not known. The purpose of this investigation was therefore to show whether the pronation angle and the torsion angle differ when running barefoot, with spikes, and with running shoes (forefoot touchdown, N = 9 left and right). A film analysis provided the angular movements of the lower leg, rearfoot, and forefoot as well as pronation and torsion in the frontal plane. The results show that at touchdown the torsional movements with both shoe types are quite different from those of running barefoot. With shoes, the torsion angle is reduced back to zero--with running shoes more than with spikes--and the pronation angle is increased beyond the barefoot values (P less than 0.01). In order to reduce the risk of injury, both shoe types should be improved--the running shoes with respect to torsion and the spikes with respect to pronation. \nImmunohistochemical studies of blood group-related antigens in human superficial esophageal carcinomas. A total of 63 surgically resected esophageal carcinomas (including 49 superficial esophageal carcinomas) and histologically normal tissue adjacent to the superficial carcinoma (nontumorous epithelium) were examined immunohistochemically for the blood group antigens (BGA) A, B, H, Lewisa, Lewisb, Lewisx, and Lewisy. Deletion of an expected A, B or H antigen occurred in 12 (24.5%) of the 49 superficial carcinomas and three (21.4%) of the 14 advanced carcinomas. Incompatible expression of an unexpected A or B antigens occurred in only one case (1.6%) in the carcinoma. In the clinicopathologic study, there was a significant correlation between immunoreactivity of Lewisa and depth of cancer invasion (chi-square test, P less than 0.05). In the superficial carcinoma, there were significant correlations between immunoreactivity of Lewisx and lymph node status (chi-square test, P less than 0.05), immunoreactivity of Lewisy and prognosis (Z test, P less than 0.05), and incompatible expression of Lewisb for tumor against nontumorous epithelium and histologic variation (chi-square test, P less than 0.01). The functional significance of alternations in BGA expression that may be associated with oncogenesis is not clear. However, immunohistochemical determination of BGA may be a more advantageous marker to predict the patient's clinical course in superficial esophageal carcinoma. \nExtraadrenal retroperitoneal paraganglioma: clinical, pathologic, and CT findings. Paragangliomas of the retroperitoneum arise from specialized neural crest cells distributed along the aorta in association with the sympathetic chain. In order to ascertain characteristic CT features of extraadrenal retroperitoneal paragangliomas to differentiate them from other retroperitoneal tumors, 31 discrete tumors and two cases of paragangliomatosis in 28 patients were reviewed retrospectively, and the CT features were correlated with clinical and pathologic findings. There were 16 men and 12 women. Average age was 37 years (range, 11-70 years). Twenty-four patients (86%) had hypertension. Of these, catecholamine levels were elevated in all 18 patients who had biochemical studies. Four patients (14%) had malignant paragangliomas. The discrete tumors were classified by location as suprarenal (26%), renal hilar (32%), or infrarenal (42%). Suprarenal paragangliomas could not be distinguished from the ipsilateral adrenal gland on CT. The average size of functional tumors was smaller (7.0 cm) than that of nonfunctional tumors (12.0 cm), but the sizes of the two groups overlapped. Smaller tumors were more likely to be homogeneous and have well-defined margins than were larger tumors. Our findings indicate that extraadrenal retroperitoneal paragangliomas are functionally active more often than previously reported and that they are readily detected by CT as soft-tissue masses closely associated with the entire length of the abdominal aorta. However, no CT feature was found that was unique for paraganglioma. \nUpbeat and downbeat nystagmus occurring successively in a patient with posterior medullary haemorrhage. In a patient with posterior medullary haemorrhage, first upbeat and later downbeat nystagmus occurred in the primary position. The lesion was limited to the posterior and medial part of the medulla. Clinical and electro-oculographic examination first showed upbeat nystagmus in the primary position and upgaze, with downbeat nystagmus in downgaze. Two and a half months later, there was downbeat nystagmus in the primary position and downgaze and upbeat nystagmus in upgaze. \nMagnetic resonance imaging of choroidal melanoma with and without gadolinium contrast enhancement. Choroidal melanoma is the most common intraocular tumor and is uniquely suited for evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of the paramagnetic effect of the melanin molecule. The authors performed T1-, T2-, and proton-density-weighted MRI on 34 patients with choroidal melanoma. Nineteen patients received gadolinium contrast, T1-weighted images were superior in both detecting and delineating tumors, showing increased contrast-to-noise ratios over other images. Gadolinium contrast further increased this ratio. These images are presented as evidence that gadolinium-enhanced MRI is valuable in the evaluation of choroidal melanoma. \nComparison of standard external CPR, open-chest CPR, and cardiopulmonary bypass in a canine myocardial infarct model. STUDY OBJECTIVES: After cardiac arrest, open-chest CPR (OCCPR) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have demonstrated higher resuscitation rates when compared individually with standard external CPR (SECPR). We compared all three techniques in a canine myocardial infarct ventricular fibrillation model. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six mongrel dogs were block-randomized to receive SECPR and advanced life support (nine), CPB (nine), or OCCPR (eight). DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: All dogs received left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by four minutes of ventricular fibrillation without CPR and eight minutes of Thumper CPR. At 12 minutes, dogs received one of three resuscitation techniques. After resuscitation, all animals received four hours of intensive care. Animals that were resuscitated had histochemical determination of ischemic and necrotic myocardial areas. MEASUREMENTS: Intravascular pressures were measured and coronary perfusion pressure was calculated during baseline, cardiac arrest, resuscitation, and postresuscitation periods. Percent necrotic myocardium, percent ischemic myocardium, and necrotic-to-ischemic ratios were determined for resuscitated animals. Epinephrine dosage and number of countershocks were determined for each group. MAIN RESULTS: Nine of nine CPB and six of nine OCCPR, compared with two of eight SECPR animals, were resuscitated (P less than .01). Three of nine CPB and OCCPR and two of eight SECPR dogs survived to four hours (P = NS). Coronary perfusion pressure two minutes after institution of technique was significantly higher with CPB (75 +/- 37 mm Hg) and OCCPR (56 +/- 31 mm Hg) than in SECPR animals (16 +/- 16 mm Hg, P less than .04). Epinephrine required for resuscitation was significantly less with CPB (0.10 +/- 0.02 mg/kg) than for SECPR (0.28 +/- 0.11 mg/kg, P less than .002). The ratio of necrotic to ischemic myocardium at four hours was significantly lower with CPB (0.15 +/- 0.31) and OCCPR (0.39 +/- 0.25) than for SECPR (1.16 +/- 0.31, P less than .02). CONCLUSION: OCCPR and CPB produce higher coronary perfusion pressures and improved resuscitation rates from ventricular fibrillation when compared with SECPR in this canine myocardial infarct cardiac arrest model. CPB and OCCPR yielded similar resuscitation results, although less epinephrine was required with CPB. \nIndices of reperfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction using characteristics of the CK-MB time-activity curve. The purpose of this study was to identify indices of coronary artery reperfusion in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by means of characteristics from the serum creatine kinase (CK) isoenzyme MB time-activity curve. Frequent blood sampling as performed in three groups with a first AMI: 29 patients treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy who had a patent infarct-related artery with normal flow (TIMI-3) at acute catheterization (reperfusion group); four patients with a persistently closed infarct-related artery (no reperfusion group); and 44 patients who did not receive any therapy aimed at coronary reperfusion (no thrombolytic therapy group). In the latter group we prospectively estimated that 25% would have spontaneous reperfusion. A physiologically based computer-calculated multi-compartment method was used to determine the characteristics of the serum CK-MB time-activity curve. In addition to demonstrating an earlier increase, a shorter time to peak of serum CK-MB and a lower estimated infarct size in the reperfusion group (p = 0.025 to 0.00001), the appearance rate constant (k1) and time from estimated initial increase to peak of CK-MB in the blood stream (tRP) were significantly different from those values in the no thrombolytic therapy group (p less than 00001). A cutoff level indicating reperfusion if k1 was greater than 0.185 or tRP was less than 16.5 hours demonstrated overlapping values between these two groups in only four patients (k1), two patients (tRP), and six patients with a combination. \nRuptured interstitial pregnancy presenting as an intrauterine pregnancy by ultrasound. Interstitial pregnancy is an uncommon subset of ectopic pregnancy in which the conceptum implants in the intrauterine portion of the fallopian tube. These pregnancies tend to progress further before rupture than do other tubal pregnancies and subsequently have greater propensity for massive intra-abdominal bleeding and maternal demise. Abdominal ultrasound can be deceptive in evaluating interstitial ectopic pregnancies. Transvaginal ultrasonography is more sensitive in the diagnosis of early ectopic pregnancy. Knowledge of the application and limitations of both transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound will assist the emergency physician in the timely evaluation of this potentially lethal condition. \nCarcinoma of the prostate: value of transrectal sonography in detecting extension into the neurovascular bundle. Detection of involvement of the neurovascular bundles (NVB) by tumor is important in deciding whether sexual function can be preserved in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostatic cancer. The nerve branches innervating the corpora cavernosa have a rather constant association with the capsular arteries and veins of the prostate, forming the periprostatic neurovascular bundle, which can be identified intraoperatively and spared during radical surgery, thus preserving potency. We examined 160 patients with biopsy-proved clinical stage A or B adenocarcinoma with transrectal sonography before radical prostatectomy to determine how useful the procedure is for predicting tumor extension into the NVB. Correlation with pathologic serial sections was obtained in each patient. The sonograms depicted the NVB on both sides in 77 patients (50%), on the right side only in 13 (8%), and on the left side only in 36 patients (23%). In 29 patients (19%) neither neurovascular bundle could be identified on the sonograms. Ninety-one tumors in this series showed evidence of extraglandular spread pathologically, which was posterolateral or into the NVB in 70 tumors involving 82 hemispheres. Using transrectal sonography, we correctly identified invasion of the NVB in 54 cases and missed it in 28 cases. NVB invasion was predicted incorrectly with transrectal sonography in 51 cases; absence of involvement of the NVB was correctly predicted in 177 hemispheres. The sensitivity of sonography for predicting invasion of the NVB was 66%, with a specificity of 78% and an accuracy of 75%. Positive predictive values and negative predictive values were 51% and 86%, respectively. We conclude that transrectal sonography currently suffers from lack of sufficient spatial resolution to detect accurately invasion of the NVB. \nC4b-binding protein exacerbates the host response to Escherichia coli. Activated protein C is a plasma anticoagulant. For activated protein C to function as an anticoagulant, it must form a complex with protein S. Protein S anticoagulant activity is neutralized by formation of a reversible complex with C4b binding protein (C4bBP). C4bBP is an acute-phase plasma protein. When C4bBP levels increase, mass action forces the level of free protein S to decrease, giving rise to an acquired functional protein S deficiency. It has been proposed that these elevated C4bBP levels and the resultant acquired deficiency of protein S that occurs in inflammation could contribute to a hypercoagulable state. An experimental model to test this hypothesis was suggested by our previous studies that demonstrated that inhibition of protein C activation rendered baboons hypercoagulable in response to sublethal Escherichia coli infusion (J Clin Invest 79:918, 1987). We have extended these studies to examine the effect of inhibition of protein S activity with C4bBP in the host (baboon) response to infusion of sublethal concentrations of E coli organisms. Five sets of animals were studied: (1) those challenged with sublethal concentrations of E coli alone (0.4 x 10(10)/kg); (2) those supplemented only with C4bBP (20 mg/kg); (3) those challenged with the same level of E coli but supplemented with C4bBP (20 mg/kg); (4) those challenged with sublethal E coli and supplemented with C4bBP (20 mg/kg) and sufficient protein S (2.3 mg/kg) to fill the protein S binding sites on C4bBP; and (5) those challenged with lethal concentrations of E coli. Sublethal E coli infusion (group 1 animals) caused only an acute-phase response with no consumption of fibrinogen, detectable organ damage, or detectable tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the plasma. C4bBP infusion (group 2 animals) resulted in no significant physiologic changes, no detectable plasma TNF, and little change in fibrinogen level. The group 3 animals, receiving both sublethal E coli and C4bBP, exhibited rapid consumption of fibrinogen, systemic organ damage, and detectable circulating TNF ultimately leading to death. The overall response of this group was very similar to the response of the group 5 animals receiving an LD100 dose of E coli. The group 4 animals, which were treated exactly as above except that C4bBP was supplemented with a slight excess of protein S, responded essentially like those that received sublethal E coli alone. These studies suggest that the elevation of C4bBP during an inflammatory response can contribute to fibrinogen consumption and vascular damage. This vascular damage may be associated with enhanced elaboration of cytokines like TNF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nFunctional recovery after traumatic transtentorial herniation. To elucidate the factors associated with functional recovery after traumatic transtentorial herniation, we reviewed the records of 153 consecutive patients admitted with clinical signs of transtentorial herniation (altered level of consciousness, anisocoria or pupillary unresponsiveness, and abnormal motor findings). Overall, 28 patients (18%) had a functional outcome: 14 patients (9%) made a good recovery and 14 were moderately disabled. Sixteen patients (10.5%) were severely disabled or vegetative, and 104 (60%) died. Compared with patients who died or were left severely disabled or vegetative, patients who had a good recovery were younger (21 versus 38 years), were significantly more likely to be children (less than or equal to 17 years old) and have anisocoria and a deteriorating Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and were significantly less likely to be flaccid or have bilaterally fixed pupils; moderately disabled patients also had a lower median age and a higher frequency of anisocoria. There was no difference in the incidence of significant intracranial hematomas between patients with a functional outcome and those with a nonfunctional outcome. Twenty-seven percent of the 95 patients with anisocoria had a good outcome or moderate disability, whereas only 3.5% of the 58 patients with bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils at admission had a functional recovery (P less than 0.05). Age, level of consciousness, and the degree of residual upper brain stem function at admission appear to be the most important determinants of functional outcome after traumatic transtentorial herniation. \nIdiopathic and L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilic fasciitis before and after L-tryptophan contamination. Recently, a causative association has been made between the ingestion of levotryptophan (L-tryptophan) and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a new entity manifested by peripheral blood eosinophilia, myalgias, constitutional symptoms, and cutaneous edema with fibrosis. Contaminated levotryptophan preparations produced at a single manufacturing company between October 1988 and June 1989 have been implicated in all EMS cases. In this study, we analyzed retrospectively 49 patients with cutaneous fibrosis for a history of levotryptophan use. Levotryptophan ingestion prior to the onset of their disease was reported by 11 (65%) of 17 patients with eosinophilic fascilitis (EF), two (20%) of 10 patients with localized scleroderma, and none of 22 patients with systemic sclerosis. The onset of levotryptophan-associated cutaneous disease preceded the availability of contaminated levotryptophan preparations in seven (54%) of 13 patients. One patient with levotryptophan-associated generalized morphea also had lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and acanthosis nigricans, findings not previously reported in patients with EMS. In addition, we compared the clinical and laboratory features of levotryptophan-associated EF and idiopathic EF. Myalgias, muscle weakness, paresthesias, morpheaform plaques, cutaneous ulcers, and livedo reticularis were more common in patients with levotryptophan-associated EF. We conclude that levotryptophan-associated EF and localized scleroderma were present before the presumed date of contaminated levotryptophan availability. The clinical spectrum of cutaneous fibrosis associated with the ingestion of levotryptophan includes generalized morphea and EF, which are similar though not identical to their idiopathic counterparts. \nPrevalence and malignant potential of colorectal polyps in asymptomatic, average-risk men. Screening colonoscopy was performed on 119 asymptomatic elderly men with no other risk factors for colonic neoplasms. Ninety adenomas were detected in 49 (41%) subjects. Mean adenoma size was 6.5 mm, with 83 (92%) less than or equal to 10 mm. Forty-nine (54%) adenomas were located proximal to the splenic flexure, and 17 (19%) were classified as tubulovillous or villous. Moderate- to high-grade dysplasia was found in 29 (32%) adenomas and was associated with larger size (p less than 0.0001) and villous architecture (p = 0.0038). Two subjects harbored adenomas with invasive cancer. Seventy-one hyperplastic polyps were found in 40 (34%) subjects. The mean size of hyperplastic polyps was 3.4 mm, and 64 (90%) were located in the left colon. We conclude that, in this population, adenomas are common lesions that are frequently small. However, substantial proportions of these adenomas may be at risk for malignant degeneration due to the presence of villous architecture and higher grades of dysplasia. Because adenomas and hyperplastic polyps are endoscopically indistinguishable, all polyps found at endoscopy should be removed or ablated. \nDirect myocardial revascularization without extracorporeal circulation. Experience in 700 patients Between May 1978 and March 1990, 700 patients were operated on with direct coronary surgery without extracorporeal circulation (ECC): 529 (76 percent) were male and 171 (24 percent) were female. The average age was 64 years (range, 35 to 86 years), 454 (65 percent) had unstable angina, 163 (23 percent) had stable angina, 51 (7 percent) had postmyocardial infarction angina, and 32 (5 percent) had acute myocardial infarction at the moment of the operation. In this series of patients, all branches of the coronary arteries were bypassed; the mammary artery was used in 40 percent of the cases, the average bypass per patient was 2.2 (range, 1 to 5), and 26 percent had associated disease of high risk to undergo ECC. The morbidity was 4 percent and the mortality for this series of patients was 1 percent; the probability of survival at seven years was 90 percent. This experience shows us that this surgery is an alternative in the treatment of coronary disease, especially for aged patients with associated disease, in some cases of acute transmural infarction, and also for patients who need coronary angioplasty. Also, it can improve the relation cost/benefit in coronary surgery. \nDiazepam and intubation in emergency treatment of seizures in children. STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of endotracheal intubation after the use of diazepam compared with phenobarbital or phenytoin in emergency treatment of seizures in children. DESIGN: The records of all children (98) were reviewed in a case-control fashion. A logistic regression model was used to determine whether there was an association between diazepam administration and intubation, adjusting for all other covariates (age, weight, convulsion time before first anticonvulsant was given, response latency, diagnosis, and therapy). SETTING: All children were treated in an emergency department and then transported to a tertiary pediatric center by a pediatric transport team. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients were children, with a median age of 2.7 years (range 0.17 to 15.3 years). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Only the use of diazepam was found to be significantly associated with intubation after adjusting for all other covariates (adjusted odds ratio, 49.4; P less than .001). In the comparison of diazepam versus phenobarbital or phenytoin used as the first anticonvulsant, median response latency did not differ (27.0 vs 32.5 minutes, P greater than .83). CONCLUSION: A significant association was found between diazepam use and intubation. Response latency was not shorter when diazepam was used as the initial anticonvulsant compared with phenobarbital or phenytoin. \nArterial hemorrhage after pancreatoduodenectomy. The 'sentinel bleed'. Experienced centers report reduced operative mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy for cancer, but significant complications continue to occur in as many as 25% of patients. Anastomotic disruption leads to sepsis in the pancreatic bed where major vascular structures have been exposed by regional lymphadenectomy, creating a setting for arterial erosion or ligature slough and massive hemorrhage. Dehiscence of the pancreatojejunostomy is a particular risk. We treated five patients with arterial hemorrhage after pancreatoduodenectomy, all of whom had had \"sentinel\" bleeding from the abdominal drains or gastrointestinal tract. Results of endoscopy were misleading in two patients. Three of five patients were saved by prompt recognition, early operation, and, in one instance, angiographic embolization. Sentinel bleeding after pancreatoduodenectomy indicates local sepsis and probable anastomotic dehiscence. Recognition of its significance and prompt response may prevent exsanguination. \nObserver variation in assessing neurophysical signs among patients with head injuries. As an early phase in the development of a valid and reliable measure of the neurophysical sequelae after head injury, we carried out assessments of interrater agreement on representative items. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of agreement among expert raters who independently measured neurophysical signs on patients undergoing physical rehabilitation after brain injury. Agreement was described using the index of crude agreement, expected agreement and Kappa. Therapists showed a high degree of agreement on those items forming part of a routine neurological assessment: prehension, coordination, voluntary movements and tendon reflexes. Crude agreement ranged from 77.8-100%. There was considerable discordance in assessing muscle tonus, equilibrium and protective reactions, spinal reflexes, tremor and dysmetria (crude agreement ranged from 49.7-97.9%). Although, the number of subjects was small, the information generated from this study will be useful in refining our instrument for the assessment of neurophysical signs. \nNontraumatic abdominal aortic thrombosis presenting with anterior spinal artery syndrome and pulmonary edema. A 51-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer developed pulmonary edema and lower extremity paraplegia with preservation of proprioception as the initial manifestation of abdominal aortic thrombosis. Back pain was present in the lumbar region radiating to buttocks and legs in a bilateral radicular pattern. Femoral pulses were initially palpable. Aortic angiography revealed complete abdominal aortic occlusion at L3 as well as total occlusion of the bilateral superficial femoral arteries and bilateral common iliac arteries. Transient occlusion of the anterior spinal artery due to aortic thrombosis may cause paraplegia and may also progress to renal failure, bowel infarction, and limb loss if left untreated. Abdominal aortic thrombosis needs to be considered in a patient who presents with an anterior spinal artery syndrome, which, if present, must be treated as rapidly as possible to preserve motor and sensory function. \nUse of the robust sib-pair method to screen for single-locus, multiple-locus, and pleiotropic effects: application to traits related to hypertension. Robust sib-pair linkage analysis can be used as a screening tool in the search for the potential involvement of single-loci, multiple-loci, and pleiotropic effects of single loci underlying phenotypic variation. Four large families were each ascertained through one adult white male with essential hypertension. The robust sib-pair method was used to screen these families for evidence of linkage between 39 quantitative traits related to hypertension and 25 genetic marker loci. All traits were analyzed on the untransformed, square-root and log-transformed scales. Among other findings, there is a suggestion of linkage between the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase locus on chromosome 1p36 and mean fifth-phase diastolic blood pressure. There may also be linkage between the following markers and traits: the adenylate kinase-1 marker and/or the Lewis blood group marker and the traits height, weight, and biacromial breadth; the glyoxylase I marker and the traits upper-arm circumference and suprailiac skinfold thickness; the ABO blood group and adenylate kinase-1 markers on chromosome 9q34 and the third component of complement marker on chromosome 19p13 and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase; and the P1 blood group and the traits weight and 1-h postload serum glucose level. \nSubcutaneous lidocaine for treatment of neuropathic cancer pain. Three patients with terminal malignancy reporting ineffective analgesia using systemic and subsequently spinal opiates were treated with subcutaneous infusion of 10% lidocaine hydrochloride. During the infusion, reasonably stable blood concentrations were achieved and maintained using a subcutaneous infusion at varying dose rates over days to months with improvement of the pain complaints which continued to be refractory to conventional analgesics. Blood lidocaine levels obtained at regular intervals revealed effective concentrations between 2 and 5 micrograms/ml for each patient. \nNot all nonpalpable breast cancers are alike. Clinical and mammographic data of 1009 consecutive patients were correlated with histopathologic data of 1144 biopsy specimens of nonpalpable breast lesions to better define the presentation and biologic behavior of early breast cancer. Patients with malignant neoplasms (269 [24%] of 1144 specimens) were older (mean age, 62.1 years) than patients with benign lesions (mean age, 54.9 years). Furthermore, patients with invasive disease were older (mean age, 63.3 years) than patients with noninvasive disease (mean age, 58.5 years) with an overall increased risk of invasive cancer per year of 1.035. A 58% incidence of invasive cancer was detected for lesions characterized by calcifications, while the incidence of invasive cancer was 84% for isolated mass lesions (relative risk, 4.31 for masses). Isolated mammographic calcifications associated with cancer appeared in a younger population and were significantly associated with noninvasive ductal cancer. Breast cancer presenting as a mammographic mass appeared in an older group and was highly associated with the presence of invasive disease. \nEffect of various lipid emulsions on total parenteral nutrition-induced hepatosteatosis in rats. The effect of various lipid emulsions on the development of fatty liver during total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was investigated in rats given TPN for 7 days. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), long-chain triglycerides (LCT), chemically defined triglycerides (CDT; structured lipid with a high purity of 94.3%), and a mixture of MCT and LCT (MIX) were prepared as the lipid emulsions. TPN provided 350 kcal/kg/day, with a nonprotein calorie/nitrogen ratio of 160. The TPN-1 group received 10% nonprotein calories and the TPN-2 group received 30% nonprotein calories. MCT TPN was found to have some disadvantages, especially with regard to nitrogen balance and plasma albumin levels. Total cholesterol and phospholipids tended to be high in the MCT TPN group. The hepatic lipid content was higher in the lipid-free TPN and the MCT TPN groups, and lower in the CDT and LCT TPN groups. Histologically, the livers of the MIX, CDT, and LCT TPN groups showed less fatty change than those of the FREE and MCT groups. \nAnticonvulsant activity of two orally active competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, CGP 37849 and CGP 39551, against sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice and photically induced myoclonus in Papio papio. Two novel N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid CPG 37849 and the corresponding 1-ethyl ester CGP 39551, were tested as anticonvulsants in DBA/2 mice and photosensitive Senegalese baboons, Papio papio. In DBA/2 mice, CGP 37849 is more potent than CGP 39551 when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) (ED50 for suppression of clonic seizures at 60 min: i.c.v. 0.038 and 0.21 nmol; i.p. 3.40 and 19.1 mumol/kg, respectively). When administered orally in mice, the two compounds are approximately equipotent (ED50 CGP 37849, 35.2 mumol/kg; ED50 CGP 39551, 28.1 mumol/kg). The time course of action of CGP 39551 is exceptionally prolonged: 42 mumol/kg i.p. protects against clonic seizures for 48 h. Protection provided by other NMDA antagonists in mice is of much shorter duration: 2-amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (AP5) 1 h, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid (AP7) 4 h, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid 1-ethyl ester 3 h, 4-(3-phosphonopropyl)-2-piperazine carboxylic acid (CPP) 2 h, cis-4-(phosphonomethyl)-2-piperidine-carboxylic acid (CGS 19755) 4 h, and CGP 37849 4 h. After oral administration of the drugs, the therapeutic index (TI = ratio of the ED50 values for rotorod performance and anticonvulsant protection) remains relatively constant at 5.9-7.2 for 3 h (CGP 37849) and 4.0-6.1 for 24 h (CGP 39551). After i.p. administration, the TI values are CGP 37849 at 1 h 2.4, and at 3 h 20.0, CGP 39551 at 1 h 2.3, at 3 h 7.1, and at 24 h 3.6. In baboons, acute administration of CGP 37849 at doses of 48-191 mumol/kg intravenously (i.v.) suppresses photically induced myoclonus for at least 285 min, with severe side effects at the highest dose tested. CGP 39551 at doses of 169-675 mumol/kg i.v. shows weak anticonvulsant activity only at the highest dose tested (accompanied by severe side effects). CGP 37849 at 48-96 mumol/kg orally (p.o.) fails to protect against photically induced myoclonus up to 4 h after administration, but 191 mumol/kg (40 mg/kg) p.o. produces complete suppression of seizures after 24 h. On the other hand, CGP 39551 at 169 mumol/kg (40 mg/kg) p.o. produces total suppression of seizure activity at 4 h with a longer duration of anticonvulsant action (2-3 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nA geriatric-anesthesiologic program to reduce acute confusional states in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a geriatric-anesthesiologic intervention program for the prevention and treatment of acute confusional states (ACS) in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures. The intervention program was based on the results of previous prospective studies in similar patient populations. The outcome of the intervention, comprising 103 patients, was compared with that of an earlier study comprising 111 patients. The intervention program consisted of pre- and post-operative geriatric assessments, oxygen therapy, early surgery, prevention and treatment of peri-operative blood pressure falls and treatment of post-operative complications. The incidence of ACS was lower, 47.6%, in the intervention study compared with 61.3% (P less than 0.05) in the control study. Furthermore, the ACS that occurred in the intervention study was less severe and of shorter duration than that in the control study. The incidence of post-operative decubital ulcers, severe falls, and urinary retention was also lower. The mean duration of orthopedic ward stay was 17.4 days in the control study and 11.6 days in the intervention study (P less than 0.001). It can be concluded that the intervention program reduced the incidence, severity, and duration of ACS which resulted in a shortened orthopedic ward stay. \nTesticular scanning: evaluating the acute scrotum in the clinical setting. In a retrospective study of patients with acute scrotal pain presenting to the hospitals of Southern Illinois University School of Medicine from January 1982 until September 1987, determination was made of the appropriate use of testicular scan for definitive diagnosis. Though the testicular scan is a highly sensitive and specific examination in the identification of testicular torsion, we believe its routine use in clinical practice is limited. Appropriate utilization of the examination requires its use in high-risk groups with equivocal physical findings or in patients with unusual presentations of age, anatomy, or neurologic deficit. The scan if used for routine screening of the acute scrotum would result in needless delays and unjustifiable expense when it is mandatory that the treatment be immediate surgical exploration. \nHereditary hyperparathyroidism and multiple ossifying jaw fibromas: a clinically and genetically distinct syndrome. A large previously reported family with hyperparathyroidism has been reinvestigated recently because of the occurrence of multiple ossifying jaw fibromas in two affected members of the third generation similar to the jaw tumors of four of five affected members of the first generation. These maxillary and mandibular tumors can be differentiated from the \"brown tumors\" of hyperparathyroidism because they can appear and enlarge even though the hypercalcemia is surgically corrected. These tumors are histologically distinct fibroosseous lesions without the giant cells seen in \"brown tumors.\" The parathyroid enlargement was mostly uniglandular, with multiple tumors found occasionally. Studies in DNA linkage were performed within this large family and a similar family in Houston to determine if the gene for this syndrome, termed HRPT2, is linked to DNA markers on chromosome 11, to which the gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 has been linked. (This linkage is supported by our findings in one family with MEN 1 reported here.) Linkage studies were also performed with markers on chromosome 10, to which the genes for MEN 2A and MEN 2B have been linked. Evidence against close linkage with chromosome 10 and chromosome 11 markers suggests that this clinically distinct syndrome is also genetically distinct. \nCarcinoma erysipeloides. We report an 83-year-old woman with carcinoma erysipeloides due to an occult carcinoma. Immunohistochemical study of skin biopsies showed reactivity to S-100 protein and human milk fat globule antigen indicating that the tumour originated in the breast. \nIntraoperative transesophageal echocardiography of atrioventricular septal defect. To determine the accuracy and utility of single-plane transesophageal echocardiography in analyzing atrioventricular (AV) septal defect, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was performed before and after institution of cardiopulmonary bypass in 16 patients (age 24 days to 14 years, weight 3 to 47 kg). Prebypass transesophageal echocardiography (including two-dimensional echocardiography, Doppler color flow mapping and pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound) correctly diagnosed divided AV valve, common AV valve and unbalanced AV valve, as well as atrial or ventricular septal defect, or both, in all cases. It correctly analyzed AV valve regurgitation in all 10 patients with right and all 14 with left AV valve regurgitation and correctly analyzed 30 of 33 additional cardiac anomalies. Transesophageal echocardiography was able to detect the absence of normal pulmonary venous connections but failed to demonstrate all of the complex anomalous pulmonary venous connections in three patients with atrial isomerism. Postbypass transesophageal echocardiography documented the absence of a significant residual shunt in 11 of 11 patients undergoing corrective surgery and verified residual AV valve regurgitation in 7 of 9 patients with tricuspid regurgitation and 11 of 13 with mitral regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiographic information that altered or refined the surgical treatment was obtained in 5 (31%) of 16 patients. Epicardial and transesophageal echocardiography results were concordant in all 13 patients in whom both were performed. Transesophageal echocardiography provides useful and accurate imaging of the important two-dimensional, pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound and Doppler color flow mapping features in AV septal defect. \nPrimary angiosarcoma of the brain. We have described a 32-year-old black woman who had a primary angiosarcoma of the right occipital lobe. All three previously reported cases have been fatal within 1 year. Our patient is doing well more than 3 1/2 years after surgery. \nAbnormal liver enzyme-mediated metabolism in Parkinson's disease: a second look. If toxicant exposure contributes to the cause of Parkinson's disease, poor function of detoxifying enzymes could increase vulnerability for Parkinson's disease. Although no hepatic enzyme system has been shown universally to be dysfunctional in Parkinson's disease patients, several have been suggested to be dysfunctional in subgroups, such as those with young age at disease onset. Specific enzymes implicated include several P450 enzymes, most notably P450 IID6, and cysteine dioxygenase. If hepatic enzyme abnormalities contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease, molecular genetic techniques may allow the development of screening tests to identify at-risk subjects in order to intervene with protective therapies. \nBilateral ureteral obstruction following aortobifemoral bypass graft. In this report we present a case of bilateral ureteral obstruction, a potentially serious late complication of aortic bifurcation surgery. The incidence, aetiology, clinical presentation and treatment are discussed. \nDoes patient age or intestinal pathology influence the bacteria found in cases of necrotizing enterocolitis? To evaluate the relationship between bacterial colonization in neonatal peritonitis and patient age or intestinal pathology, we retrospectively reviewed peritoneal culture results from 96 infants having surgery for necrotizing enterocolitis. Microorganisms recovered mirrored those usually found as fecal flora within the neonatal intensive care unit. These reflect, in turn, the abnormal colonization intrinsic to care in the intensive care nursery. Analysis revealed no significant correlation between the disease and either age of the infant or intestinal site of disease. \nObstruction of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta: results of treatment with balloon angioplasty. Our experience in the treatment of stenoses of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta with balloon angioplasty in 27 patients is reported. Clinical findings were lower limb claudication (all patients), impotence (eight patients), and blue-toe syndrome (two patients). The underlying disease was atherosclerosis in 24 patients and nonspecific aortoarteritis in three patients. Dilatation was successful in all patients. Embolic occlusions of the left common iliac artery (one patient) and left superficial femoral artery (one patient) were the only major complications. Claudication in the affected limb continued in the first patient; the second died when diagnostic angiography, performed 3 months after angioplasty, caused a severe atheroembolus. Of the other 25 patients, nine of the 10 followed up for 13-48 months and all seven followed up for 3-8 months were free of symptoms. Six of eight patients with sexual dysfunction had normal function after angioplasty. Seven patients still awaited follow-up and one was lost to follow-up. Our experience suggests that balloon angioplasty is an effective treatment of stenoses of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta. \nMagnetic resonance imaging of pulmonary artery aneurysm. Pulmonary artery aneurysm is a rare condition. We have presented what we believe to be the first case in the English literature to be diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. \nAnalysis of anti-tumor antibodies in mice and rabbits induced by monoclonal anti-idiotope antibodies. Eight different mouse monoclonal anti-idiotope antibodies (mAb2) generated against a mouse monoclonal anti-human melanoma proteoglycan Ag (MPG) antibody (mAb1), MEM136, were tested for their ability to induce anti-MPG responses in mice and rabbits. All Ab2 were idiotypically cross-reactive and combining site-specific as demonstrated by competitive cross-inhibition studies and their ability to inhibit the binding of MEM136 to the melanoma cells, Colo38. However, only two Ab2, IM32 and IM06, were able to induce specific anti-TAA-specific (Ab1') responses in rabbits. When IM32 and IM06 were tested in allogeneic stains of mice for the induction of anti-MPG responses, only IM32 produced an Ab1' response. In mice, the Ab3 response induced by IM32 is idiotypically cross-reactive with its Ab1. Furthermore, the IM32-induced murine Ab3 and MEM136 recognized a similar MPG epitope on the melanoma cells because the Ab3 inhibited the binding of MEM136 to melanoma cells. The Ab3 induced by IM32 and IM06 in rabbits also recognized a similar epitope as the Ab1. In rabbits, the Ab3 response induced by IM32 and IM06 were idiotypically cross-reactive with each other. However, additional studies indicated that the majority of Ab3 induced by IM32 were IM32 Id-specific and lacked IM06 idiotopes. Further experimentation indicated that IM32-induced rabbit Ab3 were biologically active as demonstrated by the ability of the Ab3 to inhibit melanoma cell invasion in a Matrigel assay. \nLarge amplitude sensory action potentials in myelopathy: an observation. Subjects with at least one sensory action potential (SAP) amplitude greater than 2 SD above the age-matched mean during standard nerve conduction tests were evaluated for evidence of spinal cord disease. From a total of 153 subjects, 16 had at least one large amplitude SAP and 12 of 16 (75%) had a documented myelopathy. While a mechanism has yet to be determined, this observation suggests that SAP amplitudes greater than 2 SD above normal may be correlated with clinical evidence of injury to the central nervous system. \nRecurrent adnexal torsion and cystadenoma of aberrant ovarian tissue. Torsion of the adnexa is rare, and diagnosis is difficult because of the sparse clinical findings. I describe a patient with recurrent torsion of the right adnexa, involving a cystadenoma of aberrant ovarian tissue. Her only symptom was recurrent right-sided pelvic pain. \nTreatment of pseudotumor cerebri by primary and secondary optic nerve sheath decompression. We performed optic nerve sheath decompression in 53 patients (101 eyes) with pseudotumor cerebri and visual loss. Sixty-nine eyes (85 patients) with acute papilledema uniformly had improved visual function after optic nerve sheath decompression. Of 32 eyes with chronic papilledema (18 patients), only ten had improved visual function after optic nerve sheath decompression. This difference was significant (P = .0001). Thirteen eyes required secondary or tertiary optic nerve sheath decompression after an initial successful result. Eleven of 13 eyes had improved visual function after repeat optic nerve sheath decompression. We believe that patients with acute papilledema and visual loss should be offered optic nerve sheath decompression, and if symptoms recur, repeat optic nerve sheath decompression is a safe and effective treatment option. \nA randomized trial of ticarcillin and clavulanate versus gentamicin and clindamycin in patients with complicated appendicitis. Secondary bacterial peritonitis is usually a polymicrobial infection of facultative gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Treatment consists of operation and broad-spectrum antibiotic administration. The antibiotic treatment of choice in these infections has been the combination of gentamicin and clindamycin. However, this combination can have toxic side effects and necessitates frequent monitoring of serum levels. Beta-lactam antibiotics provide broad-spectrum coverage and low toxicity, but can be inactivated by species of bacteria producing beta-lactamase enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and has been shown to extend the efficacy of ticarcillin to bacteria producing these enzymes. This combination was compared with gentamicin and clindamycin in 99 consecutive patients with complicated appendicitis. Eradication of identified pathogens was greater in the ticarcillin and clavulanate group (98 per cent) than in the gentamicin and clindamycin group (92 per cent), even for the subgroup of organisms producing beta-lactamases (97 versus 90 per cent eradication). Complications and clinical response were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. Ticarcillin and clavulanic acid is a safe and effective alternative to gentamicin and clindamycin in the treatment of secondary bacterial peritonitis and offers advantages in dosing simplicity and freedom from ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects. \nThe accuracy of malignant diagnoses established by fine needle aspiration cytologic procedures of mammary masses. Fine needle aspiration cytologic studies are being used with increasing frequency to diagnose carcinoma of the breast. To determine whether or not a diagnosis of carcinoma established by cytologic examination is sufficiently accurate to proceed to treatment without tissue confirmation, we have examined our results in a series of 109 patients who had 111 aspiration cytologic procedures followed by open biopsy between January 1985 and June 1987. From this group, 39 specimens were read as malignant and 19 were read as suspicious. Thirty-eight of 39 specimens with positive readings were from lesions that proved to be malignant on subsequent open biopsy. Seventeen of 19 suspicious specimens were also from malignant lesions. Three of 17 specimens that were inadequate and nine of 36 negative specimens were from lesions that were later shown to be malignant. Our single false-positive result occurred on cells that had been air dried during preparation in the early months of experience with this technique at our institution. Re-evaluated later in our series, the same specimen was called suspicious rather than malignant. We conclude that a positive reading on fine needle aspiration is highly accurate. The positive predictive value should be 100 per cent, once experience is gained in preparing and interpreting the material. Open biopsy is necessary for inadequate, negative or suspicious specimens to exclude a malignant lesion if the clinical or mammographic findings are consistent with carcinoma. \nNeurocutaneous melanosis: definition and review of the literature. Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by the presence of large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi and benign or malignant pigment cell tumors of the leptomeninges. The syndrome is thought to represent an error in the morphogenesis of the embryonal neuroectoderm. We review 39 reported cases of neurocutaneous melanosis and propose revised criteria for diagnosis. Most patients with neurocutaneous melanosis presented in the first 2 years of life with neurologic manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, mass lesions, or spinal cord compression. Leptomeningeal melanoma was present in 62% of the cases, but even in the absence of melanoma, symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis had an extremely poor prognosis. Useful diagnostic procedures include cerebrospinal fluid cytology and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast. Patients may be aided by palliative measures such as shunt placement to reduce intracranial pressure. Dermatologists in their follow-up of patients with large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi should be aware of this condition, to aid in prompt diagnosis and because the treatment of cutaneous lesions may be altered in the presence of symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis. \nExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of pancreatic duct stones. Chronic calcifying pancreatitis presents a major clinical problem, often requiring extensive surgery. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) offers a new therapeutic option. We applied ESWL after endoscopic sphincterotomy of the pancreatic orifice in eight patients with impacted pancreatic duct stones. An electromagnetic lithotriptor (Siemens Lithostar, Erlangen, FRG) was used. Patients were treated in prone position under fluoroscopic control. A mean of 6,813 shock waves (range 1,500-10,000) was delivered in one or two sessions. Disintegration of stones was achieved in 6/8 patients, initial relief of pain in 7/8 patients, and total clearance of the pancreatic duct in 3/8 patients. One patient had an exacerbation of her pancreatitis one day after ESWL, which resolved rapidly with medical treatment. No other complications were observed. Four of five patients with fragmented stones had no abdominal complaints at follow-up (mean 17 months, range 3-27). Three patients in whom ESWL was not completely successful (two without and one with partial fragmentation) underwent an operation according to Puestow. Two of them still have abdominal complaints after surgery. From these data, we conclude that ESWL of pancreatic duct stones is a promising new alternative for surgery, when endoscopic stone extraction fails. \nIron oxide-enhanced MR imaging of the liver and spleen: review of the first 5 years. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles are a potent new class of MR contrast agents affording improved detection of hepatic and splenic neoplasms. In this report we review the development of this agent through preclinical studies and early clinical results at Massachusetts General Hospital during a 5-year investigation. SPIO particles are sequestered by normal phagocytic Kupffer cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) but are not retained in tumor tissue. Consequently, there is a fivefold increase in T2 relaxation between normal RES tissue and tumor, with a comparable advantage in quantitative signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and lesion detectability in the liver and spleen on MR imaging. Increased lesion conspicuity can be exploited to decrease threshold size for lesion detection to less than 3 mm. Clinically beneficial effects occur with a variety of mildly T2-weighted spin-echo pulse sequences; gradient-echo techniques show even greater benefit after administration of SPIO. Metabolically, pharmaceutical-grade preparations are biodegradable and bioavailable, being rapidly turned over into body iron stores and incorporated into erythrocyte hemoglobin. Early dose-escalation clinical trials have identified a probable clinical dose range of 10-20 mumols Fe/kg body weight. In the United States, SPIO compounds evaluated to date are still approved for use in investigational studies only. Newer commercial formulations currently being evaluated may extend clinical safety margins. \nExtended duration of herpes simplex virus DNA in genital lesions detected by the polymerase chain reaction. To evaluate the utility of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for documenting herpes simplex virus (HSV) in persons with reactivated genital lesions viral isolation was compared with a recently developed PCR method. Three women experiencing four episodes of recurrent genital herpes were followed for 10 days per episode with daily examination and duplicate swabs of the lesions, one for HSV culture and one for PCR. HSV type 2 was cultured from three of four episodes and the mean duration of viral isolation from recurrent genital lesions was 2.6 days. PCR detected HSV DNA from lesion swabs during all four episodes, and HSV DNA was positive for an average of 6.8 days. HSV DNA was demonstrated in ulcerative lesions on 15 of 17 days versus 3 of 17 days by viral isolation (P less than .01). HSV PCR became negative when the lesions reepithelialized. These data suggest that PCR is a more sensitive measure of HSV infection than routine viral culture and that PCR detects the presence of HSV at times when culture is negative. \nTriple agent immunosuppression in serpiginous choroiditis. Serpiginous choroidopathy is a progressive choroidal inflammatory disorder that typically has a variable saltatory course. Response to steroids is uncertain. By using azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone in combination, the authors have observed rapid remission of active disease in five patients. Remissions have been maintained for periods up to 18 months. Because of the synergistic effects of this combination, doses could rapidly be reduced to maintenance levels without reactivation. Disease in two patients recurred immediately after discontinuation of low-dose therapy but was arrested when therapy resumed. Triple agent immunosuppressive therapy is well tolerated and appears to be effective. \nHypertension-induced changes of platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression in rat aorta and heart. Hypertension-associated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells might be mediated in vivo by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Our previous investigations in hypertensive rats failed to demonstrate changes in aortic steady-state mRNA levels of PDGF A or B chains. The current studies were performed to determine whether hypertension might affect the expression of PDGF receptors. We studied PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor gene expression by Northern analysis using human and rat cDNA probes. Studies of tissue distribution revealed that PDGF beta-receptor mRNA was most abundant in total aorta and aortic media, whereas the PDGF alpha-receptor mRNA was most abundant in the lung and was expressed at low levels in aortic tissue. Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension induced a threefold increase in aortic steady-state PDGF beta-receptor mRNA levels. Aortic PDGF beta-receptor expression also was higher in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) when compared with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Aortic PDGF alpha-receptor steady-state mRNA levels were unchanged in DOCA-salt hypertension and were expressed at similar levels in WKY rats and SHRs. Unlike the findings with aorta, cardiac PDGF beta- and alpha-receptor and PDGF B-chain expressions were unchanged in the DOCA-salt model and were decreased in SHRs. These findings indicate that hypertension can increase aortic steady-state mRNA levels for PDGF beta-receptor. They also indicate that tissue-specific expression of the genes of the PDGF ligand/receptor system are differentially regulated in hypertension. \nSubglottic laryngeal closure for aspiration. Aspiration may be life threatening, particularly in those patients with severe central neurological disease. From such a group of patients, several were identified who had severe laryngeal dysfunction and aspiration. The majority of patients in this subgroup existed in a neurologically vegetative state. In an attempt to reduce the degree of aspiration they experienced, the procedure of subglottic laryngeal closure was performed. Essentially, the operation is designed to isolate the tracheal airway from the incompetent larynx. The aim is to protect the lower airway from pharyngeal contamination. In all 5 patients there was a marked improvement in general and pulmonary health. \nPain in neonatal circumcision. Because newborn circumcision is a quick and safe surgical procedure, any method to relieve pain must be almost risk-free in order to be acceptable. General anesthesia and narcotic analgesia are not appropriate. Dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with lidocaine hydrochloride is probably the most effective and safest form of anesthesia for newborn circumcision currently available, but it can cause significant local and systemic reactions. Only a limited number of cases of DPNB have been reported and we feel that this procedure should be used cautiously until there is more published evidence of its safety. Alternative methods of pain relief including oral acetaminophen and topical anesthesia should also be studied. Of special interest is recent evidence that a sucrose-flavored pacifier is an effective analgesic during newborn circumcision. \nHeterogeneity of T cell lymphoblastic leukaemias. Twenty eight out of 170 consecutive cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were examined. They were of T cell origin, with the following distribution: seven (28%) cases had pre-T or prothymic features; nine (36%) cases showed early thymocytic features, six (24%) had cortical features; and three (12%) had a \"mature\" phenotype. The remaining three cases could not be sub-classified. A striking finding was that pre-T ALL differed from intrathymic ALL not only in the absence of both E rosettes and intrathymic differentiation antigens, but also in the expression of two non-lineage specific antigens HLA-DR and CD10. Both antigens appear in the bone marrow from the very first stages of lymphoid differentiation, implying that the origin for pre-T ALL is bone marrow. A comparison of the clinical features of pre-T and thymic ALL showed that pre-T ALL disease showed a pattern more similar to non-T ALL disease: a lower incidence of mediastinal mass, absence of extrahaematopoietic disease, lower white cell counts and haemoglobin concentrations, and a higher incidence of bone pain. No obvious difference in response to treatment was apparent. The results show that T-ALL is not only a heterogeneous immunological group but also suggest that it may have different origins: bone marrow for pre-T ALL and the thymus for thymic ALL. \nA new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia. A new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia is described, based upon the demonstration of a fall in the intramural pH of the small bowel after introduction of a test meal into the stomach. Intramural pH (pHI) is determined indirectly by tonometry, utilizing a tonometer passed per os. Postoperative assessment of revascularization procedures is also possible by the same technique. Application of the test in an 84-yr-old woman showed good correlation between a preoperative fall in jejunal intramural pH and abdominal pain, and the absence of a fall postoperatively after successful revascularization. \nExpression of human HLA-B27 transgene alters susceptibility to murine Theiler's virus-induced demyelination. Infection of certain strains of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus results in persistence of virus and an immune-mediated primary demyelination in the central nervous system that resembles multiple sclerosis. Because susceptibility/resistance to demyelination in B10 congeneic mice maps strongly to class I MHC genes (D region) we tested whether expression of a human class I MHC gene (HLA-B27) would alter susceptibility to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelination. Transgenic HLA-B27 mice were found to co-express human and endogenous mouse class I MHC genes by flow microfluorimetry analysis of PBL. In the absence of the human transgene, H-2stf, or v mice but not H-2b mice had chronic demyelination and persistence of virus at 45 days after infection. No difference in degree of demyelination, meningeal inflammation, or virus persistence was seen between transgenic HLA-B27 and nontransgenic littermate mice of H-2f or H-2v haplotype. In contrast, H-2s (HLA-B27+) mice showed a dramatic decrease in extent of demyelination and number of virus-Ag+ cells in the spinal cord compared with H-2s (HLA-B27-) littermate mice. In addition, none of the eight H-2s mice homozygous for HLA-B27 gene had spinal cord lesions even though infectious virus was isolated chronically from their central nervous system. Expression of HLA-B27 transgene did not interfere with the resistance to demyelination normally observed in B10 (H-2b) mice. These experiments demonstrate that expression of a human class I MHC gene can modulate a virus-induced demyelinating disease process in the mouse. \nVentricular arrhythmias in children with an apparently normal heart. Ventricular ectopy occurs frequently in normal children. In the presence of a normal heart, these arrhythmias, including asymptomatic, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, carry a benign prognosis and are not associated with sudden, unexpected death. However, complex ventricular arrhythmias frequently indicate the presence of underlying cardiac disease; patients with such arrhythmias must undergo an appropriately thorough evaluation before decisions regarding prognosis and the need for therapy can be made. \nDoes fetal seizure activity mean a poor outcome? A case report. Fetal seizure activity is very rare: only three cases have been reported. A case of fetal seizure activity was detected with ultrasound. Such activity can be associated with a poor outcome. \nQuantification of Helicobacter pylori infection in gastritis and ulcer disease using a simple and rapid carbon-14-urea breath test. Gastric urease was studied isotopically in 230 patients with biopsy-proven normal mucosa or chronic gastritis, including 59 patients with ulcer disease. Carbon-14-urea was given in 25 ml of water without substrate carrier or nutrient-dense meal, and breath samples were collected over a 60-min period. The amount of 14CO2 excreted at 10 min was independent of the rate of gastric emptying and was not quantitatively influenced by the buccal urease activity. The 10-min 14CO2 values discriminated well between Helicobacter pylori positive and negative patients (94% sensitivity, 89% specificity) and correlated with the number of organisms assessed by histology. The test was a good predictor of chronic gastritis (95% sensitivity and 96% specificity), and a quantitative relationship was observed between 14CO2 values and the severity and activity of the gastritis. In H. pylori positive patients, breath 14CO2 was found to be similar in patients with and without ulcer disease, suggesting that the number of bacteria is not a determining factor for the onset of ulceration. \nA long-term study of hepatitis C virus replication in non-A, non-B hepatitis. BACKGROUND. Although antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are known to be associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis, little is known about the pattern of HCV replication, its relation to antibody levels, and the clinical course of non-A, non-B hepatitis. METHODS. We measured HCV RNA in serial serum samples from five patients with post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis who were followed for 10 to 14 years after transfusion. We also studied four chimpanzees that were experimentally infected with serum from four of these patients. Serum HCV RNA was detected by a \"nested\" polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay that used two sets of primers derived from the third (NS3) and fourth (NS4) non-structural gene regions of the HCV genome. RESULTS. HCV sequences were detected by PCR in only two of the five patients and two of the four chimpanzees with the set of primers corresponding to the NS3 region, but in all five patients (and in all four chimpanzees) with the primers from the NS4 region. Serum HCV RNA was first detected within three weeks of transfusion in all five patients and within one week in three patients. The viremia lasted less than 4 months in the patient (and two chimpanzees) with acute, self-limited hepatitis, whereas it persisted for 10 to 14 years in the four patients (and for 1 and 3 years in two chimpanzees) with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Antibodies to HCV were first detected at week 12 to 14; they disappeared after nine years in the patient with self-limited disease and became borderline after five years in one of the patients with chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS. During the early phase of primary HCV infection, there is a period of several months of sero-negativity during which HCV RNA is the only diagnostic marker of infection. The disappearance of HCV RNA from serum appears to correlate with the resolution of non-A, non-B hepatitis, whereas viremia persists in patients whose disease progresses to chronic hepatitis. In contrast, antibody levels do not necessarily remain elevated in patients with chronic disease. \nNarrow-angle glaucoma presenting as acute, painless visual impairment. A 42-year-old woman presented with the acute onset of bilateral blurred vision that occurred immediately after bending over. She denied pain or any other associated symptoms. Markedly increased intraocular pressure readings were found. Treatment for acute narrow-angle glaucoma was initiated, and normal vision returned. This case represents an atypical presentation of acute narrow-angle glaucoma, a true ophthalmological emergency. The pathophysiology and treatment options of this disease process are summarized. \nAssessment of coronary artery disease using single-photon emission computed tomography with thallium-201 during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia. Thallium-201 myocardial imaging during dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia has been an accepted method for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD) and risk stratification. Adenosine is a powerful short-acting coronary vasodilator. Initial results of thallium imaging during adenosine infusion have been encouraging. In 132 patients with CAD and in 16 patients with normal coronary angiograms, adenosine was given intravenously at a dose of 0.14 mg/kg/min for 6 minutes and thallium-201 was injected at 3 minutes. The thallium images using single-photon emission computed tomography were abnormal in 47 of the 54 patients (87%) with 1-vessel, in 34 of 37 patients (92%) with 2-vessel and in 40 of 41 patients (98%) with 3-vessel CAD. The sensitivity was 92% in the 132 patients with CAD (95% confidence intervals, 86 to 96%). In patients with normal coronary angiograms, 14 of 16 patients had normal thallium images (specificity, 88%; 95% confidence intervals, 59 to 100%). The results were very similar when subgroups of patients were analyzed: those without prior myocardial infarction, elderly patients and women. The nature of the perfusion defects (fixed or reversible) was assessed in relation to whether the 4-hour delayed images were obtained with or without the reinjection technique. In patients who underwent conventional delayed imaging, there were more fixed perfusion defects than in patients with reinjection delayed imaging (16 vs 0%, p less than 0.0001). The adverse effects were mild, transient and well tolerated. Thus, adenosine thallium tomographic imaging provides a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of CAD. The use of the reinjection technique enhances the ability to detect reversible defects. \nMalignant schwannoma associated with xeroderma pigmentosum in a patient belonging to complementation group D. A 43-year-old man with xeroderma pigmentosum, XP97TO, was allocated to complementation group D. He had had moderate photosensitivity at age 1 year and freckles by age 6 but no neurologic abnormalities. Nevertheless, his fibroblasts in culture had the XP-D phenotype. They showed a sevenfold hypersensitivity to killing by 254 nm ultraviolet radiation and a diminished level (29%) of unscheduled DNA synthesis. Phototesting revealed delayed maximum erythema at 72 hours after UVB exposure and a lowered minimal erythema dose. Lentigo maligna developed on the patient's face, and a rapidly growing malignant schwannoma was found on the left trigeminal nerve. This may be the first case of a peripheral nervous tissue neoplasm in xeroderma pigmentosum. \nAdenosine as a vasodilator in primary pulmonary hypertension BACKGROUND. The acute administration of vasodilator drugs to patients with primary pulmonary hypertension has been advocated to identify those with reversible pulmonary vasoconstriction. Unfortunately, the usefulness of the drugs currently available is limited by accompanying systemic hypotension. A vasodilator with effects confined to the pulmonary circulation would therefore be advantageous in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. The purine nucleoside adenosine was infused into the pulmonary artery in seven patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (baseline pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR], 442-1,295 dyne/cm/sec-5) to determine its effect on PVR. In all patients, there was a dose-dependent and significant reduction (mean maximal percent decrease from baseline, 38.9%; p less than 0.001) in PVR mediated through a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and an increase in cardiac output. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) also decreased, but the ratio of PVR to SVR decreased (maximal mean percent decrease from baseline) by 10.5% (p less than 0.025), indicating that adenosine has a preferential vasodilator effect on the pulmonary circulation when administered in this manner. CONCLUSIONS. Because of its pharmacokinetic and vasodilator properties, adenosine may have a specific role in the investigation of primary pulmonary hypertension. \nReproducibility of Doppler echocardiographic quantification of aortic and mitral valve stenoses: comparison between two echocardiography centers. Doppler echocardiography has been widely used as a noninvasive method to quantify valvular heart diseases. This study assessed the variability between 2 echocardiography centers concerning 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic results in the quantification of mitral and aortic valve stenoses. Forty-two patients were studied by 2 different echocardiography centers in a blinded, independent fashion. In patients with aortic and mitral valve stenosis, mean and maximal flow velocities were measured. The aortic valve orifice area was calculated according to the continuity equation. Mitral valve orifice area was determined by direct planimetry and by pressure half-time. In patients with an aortic valve stenosis, a close relation between the 2 centers was found for the maximal and mean flow velocities (coefficient of correlation, r = 0.72 to 0.92; coefficient of variation, 3.7 to 7.7%). A close correlation and a small observer variability was found for the flow velocity ratio determined by flow velocities measured in the left ventricular outflow tract and over the stenotic valve (r = 0.88; coefficient of variation, 0.01 +/- 0.009). In contrast, there was a poor correlation between the diameter of the left ventricular outflow tract and the aortic orifice area (r = 0.36 and 0.59, respectively). In patients with a mitral valve stenosis, mean and maximal velocities were closely correlated (r = 0.85 and 0.77, respectively). Velocities were not found to be significantly different between the 2 centers. Variability between the 2 centers for the mitral valve orifice area was 9.8% (2-dimensional echocardiography) and 5.7% (pressure half-time). \nHypercarbic ventilatory responses of human heart-lung transplant recipients. To evaluate the effects of chronic pulmonary denervation on ventilatory control, we compared the hypercarbic ventilatory responses (HCVR) of 12 human heart-lung transplant recipients (HL) and 24 normal control subjects (C). The six male HL were subsequently compared with eight male heart transplant recipients (H), as well as the 12 male C. All subjects had normal spirometry, but lung volumes of both transplant groups were somewhat less than those of C. The HCVR of HL and C were indistinguishable (2.68 +/- 0.28 versus 2.71 +/- 0.22 L/min/mm Hg, respectively). The increment of mouth occlusion pressure (delta Pm0.1/delta CO2), however, was markedly greater in HL (P much less than 0.01). The three male groups also had equivalent HCVR, and again, the HL had an increased delta Pm0.1/delta CO2. HL men exhibited larger increments of VT and decreased frequency responses during CO2 rebreathing than did male C and H, although these differences were sta",
