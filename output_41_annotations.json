        "text": "ur weeks of treatment. The major measures of outcome included scores on the pain and disability scales of the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (range of possible scores, 0 to 3), scores on the visual-analogue scales for pain at rest and pain while walking, the time needed to walk 50 ft (15 m), and the physician's global assessment of the patient's arthritis. RESULTS. Seventy-eight percent of the patients completed four weeks of therapy. No significant differences were noted among the three treatment groups with respect to failure to complete the trial because of noncompliance or adverse events. All three groups had improvement in all major outcome variables, and the groups did not differ significantly in the magnitude of improvement in most variables. The mean improvement (change) in the scores on the pain scale of the Health Assessment Questionnaire was 0.33 with acetaminophen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.52), 0.30 with the low dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.51), and 0.35 with the high dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.57). Side effects were minor and similar in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS. In short-term, symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, the efficacy of acetaminophen was similar to that of ibuprofen, whether the latter was administered in an analgesic or an antiinflammatory dose. \nMouse macrophage clones immortalized by retroviruses are functionally heterogeneous. Murine macrophage clones were generated from thymus, spleen, brain, and bone marrow by in vitro immortalization with recombinant retroviruses carrying an avian v-myc oncogene. The cloned cell lines express F4/80 molecules, exert phagocytosis, have nonspecific esterase activity, and express class II molecules after interferon gamma activation. The macrophage clones are diploid and their karyotypes have remained stable for greater than 3 years in culture. After the macrophage clones were activated, their pattern of cytokine production was investigated. Functional heterogeneity in cytokine transcription was demonstrated: one of six liposaccharide-activated macrophages was unable to transcribe interleukin 1 alpha, whereas all of the liposaccharide-activated clones were able to transcribe tumor necrosis factor alpha. Interleukin 6 production was detected in three of six clones. The production of nitrite and tumor necrosis factor alpha as effector molecules of cytotoxicity was detected in all clones, thus showing that a single macrophage can exert more than one cytotoxic mechanism. The results indicate that immortalized and cloned macrophages have a differentially regulated expression of cytokine genes, adding further evidence for the existence of functional heterogeneity among cloned macrophages. This heterogeneity seems to derive from differentiation-related mechanisms rather than from external constraints. \nDoes selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract prevent multiple organ failure? An experimental study. Gut bacteria have been incriminated as causing or contributing to generalized sepsis with multiple organ failure in severely ill patients, and selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract of Enterobacteriaceae has been claimed to decrease septic complications in these patients. We studied the effects of selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract on survival and organ function in an experimental model of sepsis with multiple organ failure. Wistar rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with zymosan and randomized into control or treatment groups (trimethoprim or streptomycin sulfate). Selective decontamination effectively prevented bacterial translocation of Enterobacteriaceae. However, only early mortality was decreased, and only so in the streptomycin-treated rats. Selective decontamination did not result in a significantly better condition of the surviving animals on day 12. \nRole of intraoperative ultrasound examination in patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. To determine its potential impact on perioperative surgical management intraoperative ultrasound examination (cross sectional imaging, colour flow mapping, pulsed and continuous wave Doppler) was used in 16 consecutive patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. Epicardial cross sectional imaging before bypass defined the precise intracardiac morphology in 15 of 16 patients. The preoperative morphological diagnosis was refined in four patients (25%), and this influenced surgical management in two (12%). Epicardial studies after bypass identified seven residual haemodynamic lesions in five patients (three residual intercardiac shunts, one ventricular outflow obstruction, one pulmonary artery obstruction, two mitral valve regurgitation), and led to immediate revision during a second period of bypass in three (18%). In one patient who required early reoperation residual shunting was not detected after bypass by either colour flow mapping or a contrast study. Final intraoperative studies showed a good surgical result in 14 patients (87%). Flow characteristics and flow velocities within the Fontan circulation could be assessed immediately after the patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass by means of combined pulsed wave Doppler and colour flow mapping in 14 of the 16 patients. Cross sectional studies of the left heart after bypass showed no change in ventricular function and allowed monitoring of volume replacement and ventricular filling. Intraoperative ultrasound was a valuable monitoring technique in patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. It refined preoperative diagnosis, monitored ventricular function, and identified or excluded residual haemodynamic lesions in most patients. \nPrimary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma presenting as disseminated pagetoid reticulosis. The first case of primary gamma/delta cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) with a fatal outcome is reported. The patient had the clinical and histopathologic features of disseminated pagetoid reticulosis, a rare form of CTCL characterized by a strong epidermotropic lymphoid infiltrate. Extensive immuno-cytochemical studies showed that the neoplastic cells were almost exclusively localized in the epidermis, expressed the gamma/delta variant of the T-cell receptor (CD3+, TCR-delta-1+) and were CD5+, CD7+, CD27+, CD29+, CD43+, CD44+, CD45+, CD45RA+, CD54+, CD69+, but beta F1-, Ti gamma a-, BB3-, A13-, CD2-, CD4-, CD8-, CD11a-, CD49d-, CD25-, CD30-, and HLA-DR-. A comparison of our results with those of the literature, which have not included gamma/delta T-cell receptor analysis, suggests that some reported cases of pagetoid reticulosis may have phenotypes similar to our case. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated that the gamma/delta T lymphocytes were villous, containing dense and multivesicular bodies, and formed close contacts with the surrounding keratinocytes, suggesting that these cells should have a role in the skin-associated lymphoid tissue. The proliferating cells in our case might represent the neoplastic counterpart of the recently reported CD2- subset of normal human peripheral blood gamma/delta T lymphocytes. \nEfficacy of (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine in various models of herpes simplex virus infection in mice. The phosphonylmethoxyalkyl derivative (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine (HPMPC) was evaluated for its in vivo efficacy in several model infections for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) and thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) HSV-1 in mice. In hairless mice infected intracutaneously with HSV-1 or HSV-2, HPMPC completely suppressed all manifestations of the disease (skin lesions, paralysis of the hind legs, and mortality) if it was administered topically at a concentration of as low as 0.1, 0.3, or 1%. Similarly, HPMPC completely suppressed TK- HSV-1 infection in athymic nude mice if it was administered topically at 0.1 or 0.3% or intraperitoneally at 100 or 250 mg/kg/day. HPMPC was also effective against intraperitoneal HSV infection if it was given orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day or higher. In mice inoculated intracerebrally with HSV-2, intraperitoneal HPMPC treatment achieved a significant and dose-dependent protection at doses ranging from 5 to 400 mg/kg/day. The protective effect of HPMPC (at 200 mg/kg/day) was accompanied by a complete inhibition of virus multiplication in the brain. In all models of infections studied, the efficacy of HPMPC proved to be superior to that of acyclovir. The most remarkable feature of HPMPC was that a single administration of the compound, even as late as 4 days after infection, conferred significant protection against HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection. Topical or systemic HPMPC treatment is efficacious in murine models of HSV-1, HSV-2, and TK- HSV infections. \nTotal excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection. Reports of high mortality and amputation rates following total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection have prompted the use of alternate approaches including local antibiotics, partial resection, in situ revascularization, and graft excision without revascularization. Experience with aortic graft infection was reviewed to establish current morbidity and mortality rates and evaluate our bias in favor of total excision and extra-anatomic bypass. Aortic graft infection was identified in 32 patients, 8 with aortoenteric fistulas. The mean interval between graft placement and infection was 34 months. History of groin exposure (75%) or multiple prior vascular surgery (50%) was common. Clinical signs included fever and/or leukocytosis (23 patients), false aneurysm (9 patients), graft thrombosis (6 patients), groin infection (11 patients), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (6 patients). Microbiologic data, available in 26 patients, demonstrated gram-positive organisms in 15 patients and gram-negative in 9. Multiple organisms were seen in 11 patients. Patients were treated by partial removal with (8 patients) or without (4 patients) revascularization or total removal with (18 patients) or without (2 patients) revascularization. Revascularization was by an extra-anatomic route, either simultaneous or staged. Overall morbidity/mortality was less in the revascularized groups (p = 0.01), while late complications were seen only after partial removal (p less than 0.01). The best results were found after total excision with revascularization. No patient in this group experienced late infection or amputation during a mean follow-up of 34 months (range: 1 to 168 months). Complications after total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection are lower than generally appreciated. This approach should remain the standard to which other approaches are compared. \nUse of life-sustaining care for the elderly. Advanced age has been proposed as one criterion for limiting the use of life-sustaining medical treatment, but very little is known about current practices. We retrospectively studied utilization rates of intensive care (IC) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in admissions to a university hospital over 1 year (n = 9,998), to test whether these treatments are used more selectively for elderly patients. Overall utilization rates did not vary by age. However, among 524 terminal admissions, IC was used for 63% of patients age 35-74 but for only 50% of patients 75 and older (P less than 0.01). Among elderly patients, nursing home residence, diagnosis of advanced malignancy, severe chronic illness, and older age were independent predictors of withholding IC prior to death. Despite more selective use, survival rates were lower for elderly than for younger patients receiving IC (88% vs 78%, P less than 0.001). CPR showed similar but non-significant trends. Intensive care is being used less frequently prior to death for elderly patients, based on diagnosis and functional status as well as chronologic age. \nPaediatric blood pressure and anaesthesia. One percent of children have appreciably and consistently raised arterial blood pressure. A 7-year-old girl admitted for routine tonsillectomy, had unrecognised hypertension which put her at increased risk. Should anaesthetic practice take more note of paediatric blood pressures?. \nRole of intraoperative enteroscopy in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding of small bowel origin. Intraoperative enteroscopy was performed in 12 patients (median age 68 years) with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding probably of small bowel origin, six of whom were men. All the patients were evaluated by routine haematological, coagulation and biochemical profiles, upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies, visceral angiography and/or isotope scanning. All the patients were anaemic. Visceral angiography was useful on three of the 12 occasions on which it was used and isotope scanning was valuable on eight of the 11 occasions it was used. Nine patients had undergone previous laparotomy. Enteroscopy was performed successfully in all cases, with fresh blood and discrete vascular lesions being the chief findings (10 of 12 cases). Segmental resections (n = 8) and local resections (n = 2) were performed in ten patients, with two patients having more than one laparotomy for rebleeding. Five patients developed postoperative complications and there was an operative death and one late death. Three of the ten surviving patients experienced further rebleeding. Intraoperative enteroscopy is now an essential adjunct to laparotomy for gastrointestinal bleeding which has been localized to the small bowel before operation. \nChanges in body composition and energy expenditure after six weeks' growth hormone treatment. Changes in body composition and energy expenditure were assessed in 15 children after six weeks of human growth hormone (hGH) treatment. Body composition measurements were made by stable isotope labelled water (H2(18)O) dilution, bioelectrical impedance, and skinfold thickness techniques. Energy expenditure was assessed both by indirect ventilated hood calorimetry (resting energy expenditure) and the stable isotope doubly labelled water (2H2(18)O) technique (free living daily total energy expenditure). Mean increases in weight of 0.96 kg and fat free mass of 1.37 kg and a mean decrease in fat mass of 0.41 kg were observed. Significant increases both in resting energy expenditure and free living daily energy expenditure were detected. Absolute changes in fat mass and resting energy expenditure were correlated. The data suggest (i) that the increase in the fat free mass is the most significant early clinical measure of hGH response and (ii) that hGH increases the metabolic activity of the fat free mass. Monitoring such changes may be predictive of the efficacy of hGH in promoting growth. \nGastric leiomyosarcoma. Prognostic factors and surgical management. Information on gastric leiomyosarcoma, such as important prognostic factors, patterns of disease recurrence, and optimal methods of treatment, are derived from limited patient experience. We address these questions, with specific focus on whether an advantage could be demonstrated for radical resection compared with wide local excision, by retrospectively investigating 53 patients who underwent surgical treatment at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. Abdominal pain and/or gastrointestinal bleeding associated with an intramural or exogastric mass were typical features of this disease. Only tumor size and histologic grade were statistically significant prognostic factors. With analysis of survival curves and patterns of recurrence, neither the addition of lymphadenectomy nor the wider tumor-free margins of a radical gastrectomy seemed superior to the more conservative local excision. Therefore, wide local excision remains the preferred treatment when technically feasible. \nAlpha-thalassemia resulting from deletion of regulatory sequences far upstream of the alpha-globin structural genes. We describe an alpha-thalassemia determinant in which alpha-globin expression is silenced by a deletion located 27 kb 5' to the transcription start site of the alpha 2-globin gene. This alpha-thalassemic determinant, (alpha alpha)MM, is a member of a newly described group of thalassemic mutations resulting from deletion of locus-controlling sequences critical to globin gene expression. \nThrombogenic microballoon for cerebral aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and carotid cavernous fistula occlusion. Preliminary technical note. A thrombogenic microballoon was developed to overcome the problems of cerebral aneurysm rupture during microballoon inflation and incomplete aneurysm obliteration by microballoons with subsequent fatal rupture. These complications occur in about 35% of reported series with current microballoon embolization techniques. The wall of the new thrombogenic microballoon allows 80% aneurysm occlusion by inflation, thus avoiding mechanical rupture, and at the same time it produces a blood clot in the space remaining between the microballoon and the aneurysm wall. This clot undergoes fibrosis with firm adherence of the microballoon to the aneurysm wall. Experimental evidence is presented to support these conclusions. This thrombogenic microballoon system is also applicable to carotid-cavernous fistulas and arteriovenous malformations. \nTechnetium-99m-d,1-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) uptake and glutathione content in brain tumors Technetium-d, HMPAO SPECT was performed in 70 patients suffering from intracerebral tumors of various histologic types (glioma n = 30, meningioma n = 19, metastases n = 10, angioma n = 3, neuroma n = 2, lymphoma n = 2, neurocytoma n = 1, epidermoid n = 1, gliosis n = 1, cholesteatoma n = 1). Tumor classification was histologically verified in all subjects except in two cases with inoperable angiomas. SPECT was performed under resting state conditions with a dual-head rotating camera (SIEMENS ZLC 37) following intravenous injection of 18-25 mCi 99mTc-d, 1-HMPAO. Regional tracer deposit was expressed in terms of a cerebellar index (CBI). Significantly higher regional HMPAO uptake was found in meningiomas when compared with gliomas of different malignancy (ANOVA p less than 0.05). Within gliomas, regional uptake increased with malignancy (n.s.). In 23 patients, a total of 32 tumor specimens were obtained for histochemical analysis of glutathione (GSH) content using high-pressure liquid chromatography. A significant correlation (least square method, p less than 0.001) between CBIs and GSH values was found, supporting the hypothesis that GSH is the predominant factor for the conversion of the lipophilic complex to hydrophilic derivates. \nDoxapram after general anaesthesia. Its role in stopping shivering during recovery. A group of patients who developed postoperative shivering after receiving inhalational anaesthesia were assigned, at random, to receive either doxapram or a placebo under double-blind conditions. A significantly higher proportion of patients stopped shivering after being given doxapram than after the placebo. \nA technique for control of hypertrophic scarring in the central region of the face. Various methods are available for applying pressure to the central portion of the face to reduce hypertrophic scarring after burn injury. Our center uses an elastomer insert with a thermoplastic backing, which is formed over a plaster mold of the patient's face. The insert is worn under a traditional anti-burn scar face mask. We reviewed the records of 26 patients with hypertrophic scarring to the central portion of the face to assess the effectiveness of the insert. Seventeen (65%) of these patients wore the insert until scar maturation. Three of these 17 patients later required reconstructive surgery of the central face. Our findings suggest that pressure to this part of the face may be effective in decreasing hypertrophic scar formation. The insert described in this article is inexpensive and relatively easy to fabricate. \nNormal thymus simulating pericardial disease: diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging. Normal enlargement of the thymus in infancy can often lead to erroneous clinical suspicion of cardiomegaly. Roentgenographic differentiation is not always definitive but echocardiography is generally effective in differentiating cardiac pathology from an enlarged thymus. In this patient, magnetic resonance imaging was necessary to differentiate benign thymic hyperplasia from pericardial or mediastinal pathology. Thymic involution with a severe neonatal illness, followed by thymic rebound, which later subsided, added to the interest and initial confusion in this patient. \nTransseptal catheterization in adults: enhanced efficacy and safety by low-volume operators using a \"non-standard\" technique. Transseptal catheterization is often not performed because of concerns about morbidity and mortality. The authors present several refinements of this technique that have allowed a series of cases to be done with minimal morbidity or mortality. This was possible despite limited previous experience in this technique and a relatively low-volume of cases. \nAssociation between disturbances in the immune system and hypertension. For many decades evidence has been accumulating which implicates the immune system in the etiology and pathogenesis of hypertension. There appears to be a strong association between hypertension and immunologic dysfunction in humans and in rats. Patients with severe hypertension have significantly higher levels of serum IgG in comparison with normotensive controls. A positive correlation has been found between serum IgG levels and blood pressure in untreated essential hypertensive patients. In some studies it has been demonstrated that autoantibody levels are higher in both untreated and treated hypertensive patients than in normotensive control subjects. Furthermore, in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), several indices of immune system function have been shown to be depressed. There is also a significant correlation between immune intervention and antihypertensive effects. Short term administration of anti-rat thymocyte serum results in a significant decrease in the arterial pressure of the SHR. Chronic cyclophosphamide treatment prevents the progression of hypertension and significantly reduces its final level in the adult SHR. Neonatal thymic implants from normotensive donor rats delay the development of hypertension and significantly attenuate the level of the hypertensive state in the SHR. Also, thymectomy at an age of 4 weeks delays the development of hypertension in the SHR. The differences in the antihypertensive effectiveness of a variety of immunological manipulations in the SHR may be the result of their different levels of improvement on the severity of the autoimmune process in these rats. \nKlebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract infection complicated by endophthalmitis, perinephric abscess, and ecthyma gangrenosum. We have reported the case of an immunocompromised patient with a K pneumoniae bacteremia admitted with endophthalmitis. The source of the infection was an asymptomatic left renal calculus associated with a perinephric abscess. Persistent bacteremia resulted in the development of ecthyma gangrenosum, which has not previously been associated with Klebsiella spp infection. \nDEGR-factor Xa blocks disseminated intravascular coagulation initiated by Escherichia coli without preventing shock or organ damage. One of the aims of research in the area of thrombosis has been to design an effective anticoagulant that would function in a predictable and direct manner. In evaluating the role of coagulation in sepsis we used factor Xa blocked in the active center with [5-(dimethylamino)1-naphthalenesulfonyl]-glutamylglycylarginyl+ ++ chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-Xa). We infused 1 mg/kg of DEGR-Xa together with LD100 concentrations of Escherichia coli (4 x 10(10) organisms/kg) into five baboons. As controls, we infused E coli alone into five baboons. The inflammatory, coagulant, and cell injury responses to E coli of both the treated and control groups were lethal and were similar in every respect except for the complete inhibition of the consumption of fibrinogen in the DEGR-Xa group. The half life of DEGR-Xa was approximately 10 hours and 2 hours, as determined by isotopic and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. These results for the first time demonstrate that, although coagulation occurs in E coli sepsis, fibrin formation per se did not influence the lethal outcome in this model. These results also show the effectiveness of DEGR-Xa as an anticoagulant and raise the possibility that it could serve as an alternative to anticoagulants currently in use. \nSymptomatic pancreatic heterotopia treated by local excision. Non-ulcer dyspepsia is a continuing problem and in many cases a precise cause is never identified. We present five patients with an allegedly uncommon condition--pancreatic heterotopia. They were managed by local excision of the tumour and after a mean (range) follow up of 42 (9-80) months all remain free of the original symptoms. \nInfluence of parenteral nutrition on leg nitrogen exchange in injured patients. Body N balance, 3-methylhistidine (MEH) excretion, amino acid (AA) plasma concentration, and fluxes across the leg were investigated both during fasting and during parenteral nutrition of injured patients in order to better understand protein-sparing mechanisms induced by metabolic support in the whole body and in skeletal muscle. Patients were randomized to receive 15 or 30 kcal/kg.day coupled with 0.30 g of N either with standard or branch-chain (BC)-enriched AA solutions. During fasting, patients were highly catabolic (N balance -14.7 +/- 1.2 g N/m2.day, MEH excretion 422 +/- 25 mumol/m2.day) and showed a high efflux of AA N from the leg (5.08 +/- 2.1 g N/m2.day) without difference between the groups. During treatment, body N balance (-5.55 +/- 0.88, p less than .001) and MEH excretion (284 +/- 20, p less than .001) were significantly reduced without difference among the groups; also, AA N leg efflux (2.64 +/- 0.47, p less than .001) was reduced. Moreover, considering the effect of calorie load, patients receiving 30 kcal/kg.day showed a lower efflux of total AA N and of some AA considered as markers of muscle protein catabolism, such as phe, lys, met, and glu. The main difference between solutions was in the efflux of BCAA; particularly, val and leu efflux was turned into uptake in the BCAA group. No significant difference among the groups was found in N balance and MEH excretion during treatment. In brief, muscle catabolism was reduced in an amount dependent on glucose and insulin load, but it was not influenced by BCAA supply. Whole body net protein catabolism was reduced through different mechanisms, either an increased visceral N retention or a decreased muscle N loss. However, muscle N loss was never abolished even in the high calorie groups. \nMagnetic resonance imaging of temporomandibular joint after surgical treatment of internal derangement. Sagittal and coronal surface coil magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 21 patients who about 2 years earlier had surgery for temporomandibular joint internal derangement. Surgical procedure included disk repositioning (23 joints) and diskectomy (seven joints). At the time of reimaging, 20 joints showed recurrence of pain and 10 joints were asymptomatic. Extensive fibrous tissue was seen in the joint space and in the joint capsule in 13 of the 20 painful joints, whereas minimal fibrous tissue in the lateral capsule wall was seen in 3 of the 10 nonpainful joints. Fibrous tissue was surgically confirmed in 10 of the painful joints. Disk displacement was seen in 11 of the 23 joints that had surgical disk repositioning. Disk displacement was seen in both painful (9/17) and nonpainful joints (2/6). It was concluded that magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent method for postoperative imaging of the temporomandibular joint and that attention should be directed to the presence or absence and extension of the fibrous tissue in the joint space and in the joint capsule. \nPost-laryngectomy stomal recurrence: tumour implantation or paratracheal lymphatic metastasis? In the treatment of obstructing laryngeal cancer, an association has often been noted between emergency tracheotomy for airway relief and subsequent post-laryngectomy stomal recurrence. It is however unclear whether this is due to tumour implantation in the tracheotomy track, or paratracheal lymph node metastasis. To investigate the pathophysiology of stomal recurrence, the recurrence rate and clinical outcome of 26 cases of T3N0M0 glottic cancer treated with emergency tracheotomy and subsequent laryngectomy were analysed, and compared with 65 stage-matched cases treated with laryngectomy alone. Analysis shows the 'emergency tracheotomy' group to have a very poor prognosis with a higher incidence of recurrence at the stoma, and also in the regional lymph nodes. These findings suggest that paratracheal lymph node metastasis is an important mechanism in the development of stomal recurrence and thus has considerable implications for the prevention of such a recurrence following laryngectomy in the patient presenting with malignant airway obstruction. \nVentricular tachycardia with congenital ventricular diverticulum. A 24-year-old man presented with symptomatic, recurrent, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). He was found to have a basal inferior left ventricular diverticulum. His sustained VT was reproduced by programmed electrical stimulation and was unresponsive to procainamide, tocainide, propafenone, and flecainide. Endocardial mapping followed by resection and cryoablative surgery was performed. The patient had only one recurrence after 18 months, with subsequent control with procainamide for over 14 months. \nMitochondrial encephalomyopathies in childhood. I. Biochemical and morphologic investigations. During a 4-year period (1984 to 1988), 50 children referred with manifestations of central nervous system or neuromuscular disease combined with hyperlactatemia were subjected to investigations that aimed to identify and characterize children with mitochondrial disorders. Biochemical and morphologic investigations of quadriceps muscle biopsy tissue were done, including oximetric and spectrophotometric analysis of the respiratory chain function, enzyme histochemistry, electron microscopy, and analysis of mitochondrial DNA. A diagnosis of mitochondrial disease was based on the presence of at least two of five criteria: (1) abnormal results of oximetry, (2) abnormal results of spectrophotometry, (3) enzyme histochemical evidence of cytochrome x oxidase deficiency, (4) deletions or point mutations of mitochondrial DNA, and (5) abundant ultrastructurally abnormal mitochondria. With the combined biochemical and morphologic investigation, 20 of the children were found to have mitochondrial disorders. In an additional 10 children a mitochondrial disorder was neither excluded nor verified. Mitochondrial disorders are thus an important cause of central nervous system and neuromuscular disease in children with hyperlactatemia. \nPredicting the outcomes of electrophysiologic studies of patients with unexplained syncope: preliminary validation of a derived model. PURPOSE: To develop and validate a predictive model that would allow clinicians to determine whether an electrophysiologic (EP) study is likely to result in useful diagnostic information for a patient who has unexplained syncope. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-nine consecutive patients with unexplained syncope who underwent EP studies at two university medical centers comprised the training sample. A test sample to validate the model was made up of 138 patients from the clinical literature who had undergone EP studies for syncope. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing EP studies for syncope. The data collector was blinded to the study hypothesis; the electrophysiologist assessing outcomes was blinded to clinical and historical data. Clinical predictor variables available from the history, the physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and Holter monitoring were analyzed via two multivariable predictive modeling strategies (ordinal logistic regression and recursive partitioning) for their abilities to predict the results of EP studies, namely tachyarrhythmic and bradyarrhythmic outcomes. These categories were further divided into full arrhythmia and borderline arrhythmia groups. RESULTS: Important outcomes were 1) sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 2) bradyarrhythmias, including sinus node and atrioventricular (AV) conducting disease. The results of the logistic regression (in this study, the superior strategy) showed that the presence of organic heart disease [odds ratio (OR) = 3.0, p less than 0.001] and frequent premature ventricular contractions on ECG (OR = 6.7, p less than 0.004) were associated with VT, while the following abnormal ECG findings were associated with bradyarrhythmias: first-degree heart block (OR = 7.9, p less than 0.001), bundle-branch block (OR = 3.0, p less than 0.02), and sinus bradycardia (OR = 3.5, p less than 0.03). Eighty-seven percent of the 31 patients with important outcomes at EP study had at least one of these clinical risk factors, while 95% of the patients with none of these risk factors had normal or nondiagnostic EP studies. In the validation sample, the presence of one or more risk factors would have correctly identified 88% of the test VT patients and 65% of the test bradyarrhythmia patients as needing EP study. CONCLUSION: These five identified predictive factors, available from the history, the physical examination, and the initial ECG, could be useful to clinicians in selecting those patients with unexplained syncope who will have a serious arrhythmia identified by EP studies. \nStress erosive gastritis. Bleeding from stress erosive gastritis continues to be a potential problem in critically ill and injured patients, but fortunately its incidence has decreased dramatically over the last decade. The explanation for this circumstance is probably multifactorial, but clearly relates to our increased knowledge of its pathophysiology. This understanding has led to the routine use of measures to reduce intragastric acidity (luminal acid being a prerequisite for stress ulcer to occur), coupled with improved techniques for the treatment of shock and the accompanying gastric mucosal hypoperfusion (another prerequisite for the formation of stress ulcers). A number of measures have been used to lower intragastric acidity with H2 receptor blockers emerging as the agents of choice to accomplish this goal. In the unlikely event that bleeding occurs despite these prophylactic measures, aggressive medical management will result in cessation of hemorrhage in over 80% of patients. In those few individuals requiring surgery to control bleeding, no operation has emerged as the recognized procedure of choice. Thus, we believe that a conservative operative approach is indicated in this setting and recommend vagotomy and pyloroplasty with oversewing of the bleeding erosions as appropriate therapy for most patients requiring surgical intervention. \nFirst-pass nuclear magnetic resonance imaging studies using gadolinium-DTPA in patients with coronary artery disease. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging has been shown to accurately portray cardiac anatomy and function. To investigate the potential of NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary stenosis in patients with chest pain, ultrafast NMR imaging in conjunction with a T1 (longitudinal relaxation time) contrast agent was performed in 17 patients with chest pain who had undergone cardiac catheterization. These included 12 patients with significant coronary artery stenoses and 4 who underwent repeat NMR study after myocardial revascularization. Cardiac images at rest were obtained during rapid intravenous injection of gadolinium-DTPA (0.04 mM/kg). Electrocardiographic-gated images were acquired over 380 ms, with repetitive images obtained every 3 to 4 s. After contrast injection, there was pronounced signal enhancement in the right ventricular cavity, followed by enhancement in the left ventricular cavity and myocardium. Regional myocardium perfused by a diseased vessel demonstrated a lower peak signal intensity (p = 0.001) and lower rate of signal increase (p = 0.001) than did myocardium perfused by coronary arteries without stenosis. Repeat NMR study after revascularization showed an increase in peak signal intensity (p less than 0.002). These results demonstrate the clinical potential of dynamic gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain. In combination with anatomic and functional NMR imaging, this technique has the potential to provide a comprehensive noninvasive cardiac evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. \nPlasma atrial natriuretic peptide in young normotensive subjects with a family history of hypertension and in young hypertensive patients. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) behavior was evaluated in 26 untreated essential hypertensives, 21 normotensives, and 20 normotensives with hypertensive heredity under normal sodium intake (120 mEq of Na+/day). All subjects were men, mean age 22.1 +/- 1.9 years. Plasma ANP was evaluated by radioimmunoassay on samples collected in supine position upon waking and again after 1 h of orthostatism. Resulting data showed that ANP in hypertensives (supine = 44.5 +/- 19.4 pg/mL, orthostatism = 24.1 +/- 11.6 pg/mL) was at higher levels than in controls (supine = 38.3 +/- 19.4 pg/mL, orthostatism = 19.9 +/- 10.6 pg/mL) or in normotensives with hypertensive heredity (supine = 42.1 +/- 16.8 pg/mL, orthostatism = 23.2 +/- 10.8 pg/mL). Mean ANP level was higher in the latter group than in the control group (supine = +9%; orthostatism = +14.2%). In conclusion, plasma ANP is raised in young essential hypertensives, resulting in slightly elevated levels in normotensives with hypertensive heredity. \nBirthweight ratio revisited. In order to test the hypothesis suggested in a recent report that the birthweight ratio might be a useful predictor of several important clinical outcome measures in babies of less than 31 weeks' gestation, we examined the association between the birthweight ratio and aspects of both short and long term outcome in 436 Leeds babies of less than 31 weeks' gestation. Unlike the report, and contrary to what we had expected, we were unable to find any significant association between birthweight ratio and length of time on the ventilator, mortality, neurological outcome, or intellectual outcome. \nDideoxyinosine in children with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection. BACKGROUND. 2',3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddl) is a dideoxynucleoside with potent activity in vitro against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In initial clinical trials in adults, ddl showed evidence of antiretroviral activity with little hematologic toxicity. METHODS. We conducted a phase I-II study in 43 children with symptomatic (CDC class P-2) HIV infection. Of these children, 16 (median age, 10 years) had previously received zidovudine, and 27 (median age, 2.6 years) had not. ddl was administered orally in three divided doses totalling 60, 120, 180, 360, or 540 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 24 weeks. Eight of the 43 patients did not complete 24 weeks of ddl: 6 died, 1 was withdrawn because of progressive disease, and the other because of toxicity. RESULTS. After oral administration, ddl was rapidly absorbed, although its bioavailability varied greatly among patients. Pancreatitis developed in two children, one receiving ddl at each of the two highest doses. The median CD4 cell count in 38 patients with paired counts increased from 0.218 x 10(9) per liter (218 per cubic millimeter) at base line to 0.327 x 10(9) per liter (327 per cubic millimeter) after 20 to 24 weeks (P = 0.001). Those with CD4 cell counts above 0.1 x 10(9) per liter (100 per cubic millimeter) at base line were significantly more likely to improve in this respect. The median levels of p24 antigen (in 27 patients with detectable levels at entry) declined from 272 pg per milliliter at base line to 77 pg per milliliter at 20 to 24 weeks (P = 0.005). The plasma concentration of ddl correlated significantly with both the degree of decline in the p24 antigen and the degree of improvement in IQ score. Improvement in clinical and immunologic measures occurred in both the previously untreated patients and in those who had been treated with zidovudine. CONCLUSIONS. Dideoxyinosine was well tolerated and showed promising antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected children. The correlation between the clinical response and the plasma concentration of ddl indicates that bioavailability is an important consideration in the use of ddl to treat HIV infection and that individualized pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose adjustment may be important for optimal activity. \nDietary risk factors associated with acute and persistent diarrhea in children in Karachi, Pakistan. Feeding practices may have an important impact on diarrheal diseases in developing countries. This study evaluated feeding practices in three groups of male children aged 6-36 mo: 100 with persistent diarrhea (PD), 79 with acute diarrhea (AD), and 86 in a comparison group (CG). The children came from comparably poor socioeconomic settings in Karachi, Pakistan, except that the literacy rates were higher in mothers of the CG (P = 0.0001). Although greater than 95% of all infants were breast-fed, delayed initiation of breast-feeding was more common in the diarrhea groups. Children with diarrhea were also more likely to receive supplemental milk (PD = 92%, AD = 87%) than were children in the CG (69%, P less than 0.05). Feedings were not withheld during diarrhea but changes were made in the nature of foods given. These results indicate that several feeding practices may be important risk factors for diarrhea in Pakistan. \nOptic nerve sheath decompression for the treatment of progressive nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy. We performed optic nerve sheath decompression on four patients (five eyes) with visual loss secondary to nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Four of the five eyes had marked improvement in visual function after the operation. Optic nerve sheath decompression is an effective treatment for patients with nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy and progressive visual loss. \nResection of a granular cell tumor at the hepatic confluence. A precarious location for a benign tumor. Granular cell tumors are lesions that account for less than 10 per cent of benign biliary tumors and only 1 per cent occur in the biliary tract. Since the first description, 45 other cases have been described to which we add a case. In reviewing the literature, a striking predominance in black females is evident. The most frequent location of these tumors in the biliary tree appears to be the common bile duct (50%), followed by the cystic duct (37%), the hepatic ducts (15%), and the gallbladder (4%). Most patients have been treated with resection followed by restoration of biliary continuity using biliary enteric diversion. In the case presented, the tumor was located at the hepatic confluence with extension into the hepatic substance requiring segmental duct cholangiojejunostomy after resection. This resulted in fulminant sepsis and death despite adequate preoperative biliary decompression and the lack of signs or symptoms of infected bile. Alternative forms of management in the treatment of this benign condition at this location are discussed. \nAdvantages of an immunohistochemical estrogen receptor assay. Immunohistochemical and biochemical assays for estrogen and progesterone receptors were done on 20 breast carcinomas, and results were correlated with various histologic features. The slide-based immunohistochemical technique demonstrated several distinct advantages relative to the tissue homogenization required by the traditional biochemical assay. With the use of frozen tissue sections, the immunohistochemical technique permitted direct visualization of antireceptor binding to tumor cells. Receptor staining of reactive stroma, necrotic tumor, and intermingled benign parenchyma was easily distinguished from receptor staining of the actual carcinoma. This separation is not possible with the biochemical assay. In addition, in situ and invasive components and different morphologic subtypes were evaluated independently. Receptor content of the most aggressive portion of the neoplasm is likely to have the greatest clinical relevance and prognostic significance. Careful correlation of histochemical scores with biochemical assay concentrations is needed to permit the application of this technique to patients entering cancer treatment protocols. \nUse of adenosine echocardiography for diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Two-dimensional echocardiography combined with exercise is sensitive and specific in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) by demonstrating transient abnormalities in wall motion. Frequently, however, patients cannot achieve maximal exercise because of various factors. Pharmacologic stress testing with intravenous adenosine was evaluated as a means of detecting CAD in a noninvasive manner. Patients with suspected CAD underwent echocardiographic imaging and simultaneous thallium 201 single-photon emission computed tomography during the intravenous administration of 140 micrograms/kg/min of adenosine. An increase in heart rate, decrease in blood pressure, and increase in double product were observed during adenosine administration. Initial observations revealed that wall motion abnormalities were induced by adenosine in areas of perfusion defects. The adenosine infusion was well tolerated, and symptoms disappeared within 1 to 2 minutes after termination of the infusion. Therefore preliminary observations suggest that adenosine echocardiography appears to be useful in the assessment of CAD. \nTreatment of pancreatic pseudocysts with octreotide. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common and painful complication of chronic pancreatitis. Seven patients (six male, one female; mean age 49.9 years) with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts and persistent pain were treated with the pancreatic anti-secretory drug octreotide for 2 weeks. Octreotide caused no notable changes in the size of the pseudocysts of three patients. In the remaining four patients, the pseudocysts decreased in size by a mean of 42% (range 29-52%), and pain disappeared completely. These findings suggest a role for octreotide in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. \nAn open label study of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. Ten patients with advanced cancer and breakthrough pain between the ages of 39 and 78 received oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (10-15 micrograms/kg) 4 or 5 times each over 2 days (42 total administrations) in an open study. Baseline vital sign and rating scale results did not vary over administrations, except for heart rate which showed an 8 beats/min decrease over 4 administrations. Heart rate and oxygen saturation did not vary significantly over 120 min of evaluation, and minimal changes in blood pressure and respiration rate were found. Significant reduction in pain scores as measured by a pain descriptive scale, the McGill-Melzack scale, and a numeric (VAS) scale were seen at all evaluations from 5 to 120 min. Average time to onset of pain relief was 9.5 min after administration. Wellbeing was significantly increased at all evaluations. Activity level as recorded by the investigator was significantly reduced from 10 to 30 min after administration, however, activity level as reported by the patient was significantly increased at 5 min and from 60 to 120 min after OTFC administration. There were no significant adverse effects. \nInfluence of calcium administration on the short-term hemodynamic and anti-ischemic effects of nifedipine. This prospective study investigated whether pretreatment with intravenously administered calcium would influence the effect of nifedipine on rest hemodynamics and treadmill performance in patients with ischemic heart disease. Seventeen patients were studied after undergoing a qualifying treadmill exercise test that revealed ST segment depression indicative of ischemic heart disease. Study subjects performed three additional treadmill tests as part of the protocol. One treadmill test was obtained from each patient to provide baseline measurements without a preceding intravenous infusion and in the absence of all antianginal drugs including nifedipine; two additional exercise tests were preceded by an infusion and 10 mg of bite-and-swallow nifedipine. The infusions, administered in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion, consisted of either 10 ml of 10% calcium chloride (13.6 mEq) in 50 ml of 5% dextrose in water or 5% dextrose in water alone. Rest systolic blood pressure (134 +/- 4.6 mm Hg) was unchanged after placebo infusion (135 +/- 4.6 mm Hg) but decreased to 124 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) 25 min after nifedipine administration. Rest systolic blood pressure increased after calcium infusion (from 139 +/- 4.3 to 148 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and then decreased significantly 25 min after nifedipine administration to 135 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Despite a decrease at the time of peak nifedipine effect after either infusion, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower after administration of nifedipine alone than after administration of calcium and nifedipine (124 +/- 4.1 vs. 135 +/- 4.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). \nNeurophysiologic assessment of the anal sphincters. One hundred twenty consecutive patients with either fecal incontinence (60 patients), chronic constipation (41 patients), or idiopathic intractable pelvic pain (19 patients) were prospectively assessed. Patients underwent concentric needle electromyography (EMG), bilateral pudendal nerve terminal motor latency evaluation, anorectal manometry, and cinedefecography. The most common EMG finding in patients with fecal incontinence was decreased recruitment of motor units with squeezing and polyphasic motor unit potentials; these are consistent with an injury pattern. The most common EMG finding in the constipated patients was paradoxical puborectalis contraction. This latter abnormality was also a frequent finding in patients with rectal pain, as was prolongation of pudendal nerve latency. Paradoxical puborectalis contraction was diagnosed more frequently with EMG than with cinedefecography. Inter-examination correlation was best in the incontinent group between EMG and manometry. Cinedefecography had poor correlation with EMG in all patient groups but was valuable in the detection of additional pathology such as rectoanal intussusception and anterior rectocele. Electromyography including pudendal nerve terminal motor latency assessment is a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of disorders of evacuation. The information it yields is complementary to that offered by more routine physiologic examinations. \nPrenatal diagnosis of the neurofibromatoses. This article reviews the application of genetic linkage analysis to molecular prenatal diagnosis using the neurofibromatoses as an example. The clinical manifestations and diagnostic criteria for these diseases are reviewed first, followed by a brief description of the principles underlying genetic linkage analysis, the detection of DNA polymorphisms and their application to the cloning of the NF1 gene. The last two sections review the molecular diagnosis and some of the problems in prenatal genetic counseling for NF1. \nVentriculoatrial intervals during narrow complex reentrant tachycardia in children. Ventriculoatrial (VA) intervals during narrow complex tachycardia were measured in a pediatric population. The VA intervals were similar to those in adults but were slightly shorter. In the pediatric subjects values less than 60 msec excluded the participation of an accessory pathway in the tachycardia circuit. Three out of 11 patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) had VA values greater than or equal to 70 msec, while 5 of 28 patients with orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (ORT) had values less than or equal to 70 msec. Using a cut-off value of 70 msec as the sole criteria to distinguish between ORT and AVNRT could lead to errors in classification of the underlying mechanism of the tachycardia. \nA familial coincidence of pseudotumor cerebri and communicating hydrocephalus. A family in which the mother and two of four daughters had a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri and one son developed communicating hydrocephalus is described. The other two daughters both have a long history of headaches but no signs of intracranial hypertension. The argument is advanced that there exists a defect of cerebrospinal fluid absorption common to pseudotumor cerebri and communicating hydrocephalus. \nPhysical activity and reduced occurrence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus BACKGROUND. Physical activity is recommended by physicians to patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), because it increases sensitivity to insulin. Whether physical activity is effective in preventing this disease is not known. METHODS. We used questionnaires to examine patterns of physical activity and other personal characteristics in relation to the subsequent development of NIDDM in 5990 male alumni of the University of Pennsylvania. The disease developed in a total of 202 men during 98,524 man-years of follow-up from 1962 to 1976. RESULTS. Leisure-time physical activity, expressed in kilocalories expended per week in walking, stair climbing, and sports, was inversely related to the development of NIDDM. The incidence rates declined as energy expenditure increased from less than 500 kcal to 3500 kcal. For each 500-kcal increment in energy expenditure, the age-adjusted risk of NIDDM was reduced by 6 percent (relative risk, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 0.98). This association remained the same when the data were adjusted for obesity, hypertension, and a parental history of diabetes. The association was weaker when we considered weight gain between the time of college attendance and 1962 (relative risk, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.00). The protective effect of physical activity was strongest in persons at highest risk for NIDDM, defined as those with a high body-mass index, a history of hypertension, or a parental history of diabetes. These factors, in addition to weight gain since college, were also independent predictors of the disease. CONCLUSIONS. Increased physical activity is effective in preventing NIDDM, and the protective benefit is especially pronounced in persons at the highest risk for the disease. \nIsolation of a human DNA sequence which spans the fragile X. To identify the sequences involved in the expression of the fragile X and to characterize the molecular basis of the genetic lesion, we have constructed yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing human DNA and have screened them with cloned DNA probes which map close to the fragile site at Xq27.3. We have isolated and partly characterized a YAC containing approximately 270 kb of human DNA from an X chromosome which expresses the fragile X. This sequence in a yeast artificial ring chromosome, XTY26, hybridizes to the two closest DNA markers, VK16 and Do33, which flank the fragile site. The human DNA sequence in XTY26 also spans the fragile site on chromosome in situ hybridization. When a restriction map of XTY26, derived by using infrequently cutting restriction enzymes, is compared with similar YAC maps derived from non-fragile-X patients, no large-scale differences are observed. This YAC, XTY26, may enable (a) the fragile site to be fully characterized at the molecular level and (b) the pathogenetic basis of the fragile-X syndrome to be determined. \nHepatitis C virus infection and chronic liver disease in children with leukemia in long-term remission. Antibody to the recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) was investigated in sera of 50 leukemic children who had chronic liver disease (CLD), observed for 1 to 12.6 years after therapy withdrawal. All patients were tested for anti-HCV at regular intervals: Ortho-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was performed in all cases. Reactive sera were also tested by recombinant immunoblotting assay to define the specificity of the results obtained by ELISA. Twelve cases (24%) were persistently positive (group A), 11 (22%) were transiently anti-HCV+ positive (group B), and 27 (54%) were negative. Mean SGPT peak during follow-up was significantly higher in group A (P = .014, A v B and P less than .00001, A v C). SGPT normalized off-therapy in 1 of 12 cases (group A), 10 of 11 (group B), and 19 of 27 (group C) (P = .0004, A v B and P = .012, A v C). Accordingly, liver histology, available in 37 patients, showed signs of chronic hepatitis in all patients in group A while most patients in group B and C had less severe liver lesions. These results indicate that HCV plays a significant role in the etiology of chronic hepatitis in leukemic patients and that persistent anti-HCV activity correlates with a more severe CLD, which could jeopardize the final prognosis of children cured of leukemia. \nAntihypertensive effect of isradipine on blood pressure at rest and during exercise. After three months of treatment with isradipine, 20 patients with mild hypertension had reduced their resting blood pressure (BP) from 157/103 to 132/85 mm Hg and their BP during isometric exercise from 192/124 to 166/105 mm Hg. The isradipine dose necessary to normalize BP (both at rest and post-exercise) was 1.25 mg twice daily (2 x 1/2 tablet) in 50% of patients and 2.5 mg twice daily (2 x 1 tablet) in 25%. In the remaining 25% of patients, isradipine was combined with 1 mg/day bopindolol. There were virtually no accompanying side effects; in particular, reflex tachycardia was negligible or absent. It is concluded that isradipine is a reliable antihypertensive treatment in mild-to-moderate hypertension. \nDiagnostic imaging of musculoskeletal infection. Roentgenography; gallium, indium-labeled white blood cell, gammaglobulin, bone scintigraphy; and MRI. A great deal of effort has been made to evaluate and define the role of various diagnostic imaging techniques in various clinical settings that complicate the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Except possibly in neonates, bone scintigraphy remains generally recommended when there has been no previous osseous involvement. In other cases of chronic disease, previous fracture or trauma, prosthesis, and diabetic foot, In-WBC scintigraphy is generally accepted as an appropriate imaging technique. MRI will play an increasingly important role in diagnosing osteomyelitis and may prove to be an important adjunct in these cases. Research continues to improve our current diagnostic armamentarium. In-IgG appears to avoid practical deficiencies encountered with 67Ga and In-WBC; it remains to be seen what role this agent will play in routine clinical practice. All agents to date image inflammation, not infection, and most require delayed imaging sessions, usually at 24 hours. These shortcomings necessitate further research to develop new radiotracers that can provide useful images within several hours and that are specific for infection, perhaps ultimately delineating the particular microorganism involved. \nMeningiomas of the lateral skull base: neurotologic manifestations and patterns of recurrence. The eradication of basicranial meningiomas by traditional surgical techniques is often hindered by neoplastic entanglement with critical neurovascular structures. Apparent, complete tumor resection is frequently followed by extensive, yet clinically silent, recurrent disease with local infiltration of bone, cranial nerves, and brain. Fifty-five cases of sphenoid wing or parasellar meningioma were analyzed to identify clinical manifestations suggestive of early tumor recurrence. Regrowth patterns were then defined according to preoperative radiographic and intraoperative surgical findings. Medial tumor regrowth, involving the cavernous sinus, caused neurapraxia of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI, with associated diplopia or ophthalmoplegia. Inferior (caudal) regrowth of disease involved the infratemporal fossa, pterygomaxillary space, or paranasal sinuses by bony erosion of the middle cranial fossa floor or through natural anatomic foramina and fissures. Such inferior extension was manifested clinically by facial hypesthesia, trismus, and referred otalgia caused by trigeminal nerve involvement and by autophony or serous otitis media related to eustachian tube obstruction. Posterior tumor regrowth occurred along the petrous bone and horizontal carotid canal, resulting in internal auditory meatus erosion and cerebellopontine angle extension with associated tinnitus, hearing loss, unsteadiness, and occasional facial twitching. While the clinical and radiographic evaluations of any patient with a suspected recurrent basicranial meningioma are critical in planning the method and magnitude of reoperation, an understanding of potential recurrence patterns can be used in devising more extensive, combined approaches that may allow complete tumor extirpation at the initial surgical intervention. \nProvocation of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations by meals in patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux. The effect of a meal on the rate of transient lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxations and patterns of gastroesophageal reflux was investigated in 49 patients referred for evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux. Esophageal motility and pH were recorded concurrently before and after a standard meal. In the patients with symptomatic reflux, the meal induced a four- to sevenfold increase in the gastroesophageal reflux through two mechanisms: a four- to fivefold increase in the rate of transient LES relaxations and an increase in the proportion of transient LES relaxations accompanied by reflux from 47% to 68%. Overall the rate of reflux episodes that occurred by mechanisms other than transient LES relaxation did not increase significantly. An exception to these findings were those in six patients with chronically absent basal LES pressure in whom transient LES relaxations could not be scored. In these patients, reflux increased postprandially through mechanisms other than transient LES relaxation. These findings confirm the pivotal importance of transient LES relaxations in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux. \nAtrial antitachycardia pacing in children and young adults. Atrial antitachycardia pacing was tested in 23 children and young adults. The majority of these patients had had operative repair of congenital cardiac defects and had both bradycardia and tachycardia. Pacemakers were usually implanted by the transvenous technique using bipolar leads. In each patient it was possible to find a tachycardia termination algorithm that successfully converted the tachycardia. In some patients very complex algorithms were necessary. In each patient it was also possible to find an algorithm that successfully differentiated the abnormal tachycardia from sinus tachycardia. Twelve patients required no antiarrhythmic drugs after pacemaker implantation, while 10 patients required one drug and one patient required two drugs. Eight of 23 patients had symptomatic tachycardias that required reprogramming the pacemaker to a different tachycardia termination sequence. Seven patients required reoperations, five for adapter problems and two for infection or erosion. Cardiac function improved in 15 of the 23 patients. Antitachycardia pacing is a viable option for management of tachycardias in children and young adults. \nPrevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon in Japanese males and females. In order to estimate the prevalence rate of Raynaud's phenomenon in the Japanese population, 1875 males and 1998 females were interviewed by medical doctors, aided by a typical photograph of Raynaud's phenomenon. The prevalence rates were 3.3% in males and 2.5% in females. Approximately 60% of the male cases of Raynaud's phenomenon were presumed to be caused by vibration syndrome or trauma to the fingers. Prevalence rates excluding these two causes were 1.2% in males and 2.2% in females. The male:female ratio of these prevalence rates was 1:1.9. The prevalence rate for males increased with age, while that for females tended to decrease. The male:female ratio for subjects under 50 years old was 1:5.2 and for those 50 years old or older the ratio was 1:1.1. The prevalence rates of symptoms limited to finger whitening, excluding cases caused by vibration syndrome or trauma, were 1.0% in males and 1.8% in females. Both of these prevalence rates were lower than those of male and female Caucasians. \nThe physical examination in acute cardiac ischemic syndromes. The physical examination in acute cardiac ischemia remains a valuable tool when done with skill. Ischemia without infarction alters cardiac function, and the physical examination yields findings that reflect these changes. Ischemia with infarction alters structure and function, resulting in physical findings that are usually more dramatic and of longer duration, sometimes permanent. Carefully done, the physical examination provides information that helps in management of the immediate course, predicts prognosis, and allows for better interpretation of cardiovascular tests, both invasive and noninvasive. \nPhase I/II study of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin for treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma. Leucovorin enhances the cytotoxicity of fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with colorectal cancer and may increase the efficacy of combination chemotherapy regimens containing 5-FU. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU with leucovorin for use in combination with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, we conducted a phase I/II trial in 20 patients. The doses of leucovorin (200 mg/m2 on days 1-5), cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 on day 1), and doxorubicin (40 mg/m2 on day 1) were held constant, while the dose of 5-FU was escalated in cohorts of patients beginning at 150 mg/m2 on days 1-5. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. Significant mucositis, diarrhea, and myelosuppression were infrequently observed in patients receiving up to 250 mg/m2 5-FU on days 1-5. In contrast, at a dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1-5, three of six patients had granulocyte count nadirs of less than 500/microL during the first cycle of therapy, and two of these three had platelet counts of less than 25,000/microL. In addition, two patients treated at this dose had significant mucosal toxic effects, and three had insufficient recovery to permit a second course by day 22. Among 14 patients with assessable breast cancer, there were one complete and nine partial responses (response rate 71%). Leucovorin modulation of 5-FU can be safely incorporated into combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin and provides a highly active regimen for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Further study will be required to determine whether the addition of leucovorin significantly enhances the activity of this regimen. \nDeep vein thrombosis: effect of graduated compression stockings on distension of the deep veins of the calf. The mechanisms by which graduated compression stockings prevent deep vein thrombosis are not completely understood. Recent work has suggested that venous distension plays a role in initiating the process. Our previous work has shown that the deep veins of the lower limb distend in patients undergoing surgical procedures. We have investigated 40 patients receiving surgical treatment on the abdomen or neck. A medial gastrocnemius vein was studied using ultrasound imaging during the operations. In half the patients a graduated compression anti-embolism stocking was applied to the limb under study at the start of the operation, immediately after initial measurements of vein diameter. The median vein diameter in both groups was the same at the start of the operative procedures (control, 2.6 mm, interquartile range 2.1-3.3 mm; stocking, 2.6 mm, interquartile range 2.1-3.7 mm). After application of a stocking the median diameter in this group fell to 1.6 mm (interquartile range 1.3-2.8 mm) and then decreased slightly at the end of the operation. In the control group the vein diameter increased to 2.9 mm (interquartile range 2.3-4.0 mm) during the operative procedure. \nRight coronary artery disease. Pathophysiology, clinical relevance, and methods for recognition. Among the clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease, right coronary artery (RCA) disease offers a wide variety of right and left ventricular ischemic involvement, including prevalent right ventricular dysfunction and severe cardiac failure. Whether the right ventricular impairment is dependent primarily on ischemia of the right ventricle or requires a concomitant left ventricular dysfunction remains debatable. To assess the pathophysiology and clinical relevance of RCA-related ischemia, a systematic study of patients with single RCA disease (either vasospastic angina at rest or typical stable angina) was undertaken by radionuclide ventriculography. A high incidence of ischemia-induced right ventricular dysfunction was observed (93% and 95% in angina at rest and on effort, respectively), either alone or associated with left ventricular impairment. These results were compared with those obtained in a control population with isolated left anterior descending artery disease and either primary or secondary angina pectoris. We infer that the impairment of the right ventricle was related primarily to right ventricular ischemia and that left ventricular dysfunction alone did not cause an important depression of right ventricular systolic function. In conclusion, the clinical manifestations of RCA disease can be protean; the right ventricle can be the target of ischemia, and recognition of its impairment poses diagnostic problems. Radionuclide ventriculography and two-dimensional echocardiography, together with stressors of coronary flow reserve, are reliable techniques for assessing RCA-related ischemia. \nUnrecognized stenosis by angiography documented by intravascular ultrasound imaging. This report documents how intravascular ultrasound imaging was used to diagnose a short \"napkin-ring\" stenosis that was missed by coronary angiography. Intravascular ultrasound revealed a lumen of 2.6 x 2.5 mm in diameter and 5.0 mm2 in cross-sectional area, with a residual atheroma that occluded 63% of available cross-sectional area at the stenosis. \nReduction in the frequency of ventricular late potentials after acute myocardial infarction by early thrombolytic therapy. Ventricular late potentials are strong predictors of arrhythmic events after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). To assess the effect of intravenous thrombolysis on the incidence of ventricular late potentials, 223 consecutive patients surviving a first AMI were included in the present study: 59 patients (53 men, 6 women, mean age +/- standard deviation 55 +/- 10 years) received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (100 mg over 3 hours, group A) and 164 patients (123 men, 41 women, mean age 61 +/- 11 years) received conventional medical treatment (group B). A time-domain signal-averaged electrocardiogram and a high-resolution beat-to-beat recording (gain 10(6), filters 100 to 300 Hz) were performed at 10 +/- 3 days after AMI. There was no difference between group A and B patients in terms of AMI location (anterior in 28 of 59 vs 80 of 164, difference not significant [NS]), mean left ventricular ejection fraction (55 +/- 10 vs 55 +/- 13%, NS), or presence of heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV in 12 of 59 vs 40 of 164, NS). The incidence of ventricular late potentials was 10% (6 of 59) in group A and 24% (39 of 164) in group B (p less than 0.05). Among the 146 patients who underwent coronary arteriography, the incidence of ventricular late potentials was 13% (10 of 80) in patients with a patent infarct-related artery and 26% (17 of 66) in patients with an occluded infarct-related artery (p less than 0.05). \nA phase IA trial of sequential administration recombinant DNA-produced interferons: combination recombinant interferon gamma and recombinant interferon alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study investigated the effects of sequentially administered recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) and recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN alpha) in 36 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). rIFN alpha was subcutaneously administered daily for 70 days at dosages that varied (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 x 10(6) U/m2) across four cohorts of patients. Within each cohort of patients receiving a given dose of rIFN alpha, three subsets of patients received either 30, 300, or 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. rIFN gamma was administered intravenously for 5 days every third week, 6 hours prior to administration of rIFN alpha. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included constitutional symptoms, leukopenia, nephrotic syndrome with acute renal failure, hypotension associated with death, and congestive heart failure. DLT was related more often to the rIFN alpha dose level than to rIFN gamma dose level. Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 10 x 10(6) U/m2 rIFN alpha and 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. Six patients failed to complete a minimum of 21 days of therapy due to toxicity or rapid progression of disease. Clinical responses were seen in eight of 30 assessable patients. Two patients experienced complete remission and have remained in complete remission 20+ and 22+ months. An additional six patients have shown partial responses for 4 to 18+ months. One patient in partial remission continues to show slow regression of pulmonary and liver lesions off therapy with rIFNs. Clinical responses have remained durable for patients with complete remissions and patients with partial remissions. The results of this study suggest that toxicities associated with combination rIFN therapy can be reduced by administering these agents sequentially as opposed to simultaneously. \nPrimary cardiac leiomyosarcomas. Two patients with primary cardiac leiomyosarcoma, one of the rarest malignant tumors of the heart, are described. The first patient had a tumor of the pulmonary trunk and was admitted with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary thromboembolism. The second had a tumor of the left atrium and had signs and symptoms of mitral valve obstruction and regurgitation. The 2 patients were operated on and later underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. Both died more than 22 months after operation, having required multiple hospital admissions for treatment of complications related to the pathology or the treatment of the primary cardiac leiomyosarcoma. Nonetheless, aggressive surgical excision followed by chemotherapy appears to have improved survival in these patients with primary cardiac leiomyosarcoma, as they are among the longest survivors reported. \nRegulation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor binding by heterologous and autologous receptor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Pancreatic cancers overexpress tyrosine kinase and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) receptor (LH-RHR)-mediated tyrosine phosphatase. LH-RHR is a 60-kDa protein. One of the substrates of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity and LH-RH- and somatostatin-stimulated tyrosine phosphatase activity is also a 60-kDa protein. This suggests the possibility that LH-RHR regulation by tyrosine phosphatase and tyrosine kinase is mediated by (de)phosphorylation of existing LH-RHR. To test this hypothesis, membranes of MIA PaCa-2 cells, a human dedifferentiated pancreatic cancer cell line, were incubated without hormone (control) or with 0.1 microM EGF or somatostatin analogue RC-160 for 1 hr at 4 degrees C to phosphorylate the 60-kDa protein. Competition binding experiments with I125-labeled [D-Trp6]LH-RH by displacement with a nonradioactive ligand showed that the LH-RH binding in 69% of the points was increased by EGF and 85% was decreased by RC-160 compared with controls (n = 61; both significant, P less than 0.001). The specific binding was altered, increasing 50-150% after preincubation with EGF and decreasing 60-70% after RC-160. No change was seen in the binding affinity constant after pretreatment with EGF or RC-160. This shows that phosphorylation regulates binding of LH-RH and may explain the up-regulation by EGF and down-regulation by RC-160 and by LH-RH of the LH-RH response. \nNoninvasive diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. Deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity poses a diagnostic challenge. Clinical signs and symptoms are often misleading, and sensitive and specific tests are essential for diagnosis. The cost, patient discomfort and risk of morbidity associated with contrast venography have led to the development of noninvasive diagnostic techniques such as Doppler ultrasound, impedance plethysmography and duplex ultrasound scanning. If noninvasive tests unequivocally indicate deep venous thrombosis, treatment may be started without the need for contrast venography. \nEffects of perinatal stroke on striatal amino acid efflux in rats studied with in vivo microdialysis. We used in vivo microdialysis to determine the impact of a focal hypoxic-ischemic insult on striatal amino acid efflux in the immature brain. Microdialysis probes were inserted into the right striatum of postnatal day 7 rats. To induce hypoxic-ischemic injury, the right carotid artery was ligated and the animals were exposed to 8% oxygen for 2.5 hours (n = 22). Rats exposed to ligation alone (n = 10) or hypoxia alone (n = 8) and untreated controls (n = 17) were also studied. Two hours after probe insertion, a 30-minute baseline microdialysis sample was obtained. After arterial ligation, two additional baseline samples were collected. Five more samples were collected over the next 2.5 hours (in 8% oxygen or room air). Eight amino acids (glutamate, aspartate, taurine, glutamine, alanine, serine, glycine, and asparagine) were consistently detected in dialysates using a high-performance liquid chromatography assay with electrochemical detection. In untreated controls, amino acid efflux did not change over 4 hours. During hypoxia-ischemia, efflux values fluctuated widely, with marked intra-animal and interanimal variability. Efflux peaks for each amino acid were defined as values greater than the highest control mean value plus two standard deviations. Glutamate efflux peaks (greater than 7 pmol/min compared with 2 pmol/min at baseline) were detected in no controls and in eight hypoxic-ischemic rats (p = 0.006, Fisher's two-tailed exact test). Taurine efflux peaks (greater than 75 pmol/min compared with 10 pmol/min for controls at baseline) were detected in 10 hypoxic-ischemic rats and one control (p = 0.01) and in seven of the eight animals in which glutamate efflux peaks occurred (p = 0.006). \nPatterns of morbidity and mortality in typhoid fever dependent on age and gender: review of 552 hospitalized patients with diarrhea. Features of typhoid fever were correlated with age and gender through a review of the charts of 552 hospitalized culture-positive patients with diarrhea in Bangladesh. Seizures occurred more frequently in children from birth through 10 years of age (5%-11%) and pneumonia more frequently in children from birth through 5 years of age (8%-15%) than in older age groups (P less than .05), whereas intestinal perforation occurred more frequently in patients greater than or equal to 11 years of age (5%-25%) than in younger age groups (P less than .005). Compared with older age groups, children from birth through 10 years of age were more anemic, those from birth through 5 years of age had a higher mean white blood cell count, and those from birth through 1 year of age had a lower mean blood carbon dioxide content (all P less than .05). Female patients were more severely anemic than male patients (P less than .05). The case-fatality rate was 4.3% overall, with the highest rates for children from birth through 1 year of age (11%) and adults greater than or equal to 31 years of age (10%). Female patients had a higher case-fatality rate (6%) than male patients (3%), although the difference was not significant (P greater than .05). Death was independently associated with seizures, intestinal perforation, pneumonia, and delirium or coma. These results indicated that the patients with typhoid fever who were at highest risk of complications and death were children from birth through 1 year of age and adults greater than or equal to 31 years of age. \nDiurnal blood pressure variation in quadriplegic chronic spinal cord injury patients. 1. Measurement of blood pressure and heart rate over a 24 h period was performed in 10 quadriplegic spinal cord injury patients and 10 immobilized, neurologically intact orthopaedic subjects by using the Spacelabs 90207 automated ambulatory monitoring system. 2. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell significantly at night in orthopaedic subjects but not in quadriplegic patients, and night-time blood pressures were similar in both groups. 3. Cumulative summation of differences from a reference value (cusum analysis) confirmed a markedly diminished diurnal blood pressure variation in the quadriplegic patients. 4. These findings could not be accounted for on the basis of blood pressure variations during chronic postural change. 5. Heart rate fell significantly at night in both groups. 6. The findings suggest that the increase in blood pressure during waking hours in neurologically intact subjects is a consequence of a diurnal variation in sympathetic activity (absent in quadriplegic patients with sympathetic decentralization) which is independent of changes in physical activity. \nPostpericardiotomy and postmyocardial infarction syndrome presenting as noncardiac pulmonary edema. Three cases are reported that describe acute pulmonary edema as an early manifestation of a postpericardiotomy or postmyocardial infarction syndrome. Each of these cases occurred in the presence of good left ventricular function. The cases suggest this syndrome occurs in immunologically primed patients who have had prior cardiac injury resulting in readily available heart antibody. The first report followed an acute myocardial infarction that required a temporary pacemaker, and the two other cases occurred following coronary artery bypass surgery. Two of the patients had a history of distant myocardial or pericardial injury, and the third patient had an acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction two to three weeks before cardiac surgery. All three patients with pulmonary edema responded dramatically to corticosteroids, having been resistant to diuretic and pre-load and afterload reduction therapy, suggesting an autoimmune capillary injury process. Early recognition of such a syndrome is important since all three patients were successfully treated, and might otherwise have been confused with other causes of pulmonary edema. \nSplanchnic oxygen consumption in septic and hemorrhagic shock. Oxygen consumption (VO2) is dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2) in septic shock. Local hypoxia with later secondary organ failure may develop, however, despite an often hyperdynamic circulation. The splanchnic organs seem to be of vital importance in this context. In experiments performed in pigs we compared total body VO2 and DO2 with oxygen consumption and delivery in the gastrointestinal organs and the liver in two different shock states: (1) septic shock induced by peritonitis (n = 6) and (2) hemorrhagic shock (n = 6). Another group of six animals not in shock served as controls. Total, gastrointestinal, and liver DO2 decreased in a similar pattern in both septic and hemorrhagic shock. Gastrointestinal and liver VO2 increased in sepsis, whereas it was unchanged in hemorrhage. In the later phase of sepsis, liver VO2, but not gastrointestinal VO2, again decreased, because liver oxygen extraction was almost total and liver DO2 decreased further. The development of flow-dependent liver hypoxia was reflected in a decrease in liver lactate turnover (increased liver lactate release) during late sepsis. Early hypoxia in the splanchnic region is suggested as a plausible mechanism behind the development of secondary organ failure, especially in sepsis. \nLong-term L-carnitine treatment in isovaleric acidemia. A 5-year-old girl with isovaleric acidemia was treated with long-term L-carnitine and no supplemental glycine. Clinical and laboratory data are presented. Following diagnosis and treatment at age 2 years, the frequency of acute exacerbations of metabolic acidosis was reduced and she resumed normal growth and development. L-carnitine supplementation and protein restriction may be sufficient for effective therapy of isovaleric acidemia. \nWrist movements in able-bodied and brain injured individuals. The purpose of this study was to compare movement velocity characteristics during targeted wrist movements between able-bodied individuals and a sample of individuals with spasticity secondary to closed head injury. Two amplitudes (30 degrees and 60 degrees) of movement were performed at slow and fast velocities, with the forearm either passively supported or actively supported by elbow extension and shoulder flexion. Variables measured were the following: (1) average velocity of entire movement, (2) velocity for 10 degrees increments of a movement, and (3) ratio of average peak 10 degrees increment velocity to average velocity. In addition, qualitative examination of velocity profiles was performed. Slow movements were performed in a discontinuous manner by both groups; however, observable differences in peak/average velocity were noted between groups in the unsupported position during slow and fast movements. Able-bodied individuals performed seven of eight fast movements with greater velocity (p less than .05) than brain injured individuals, and the fast movements of the able-bodied subjects were continuous. \nRecurrent prolonged coma due to basilar artery migraine. A case report. A 25 year old patient presented with recurrent prolonged episodes of life-threatening coma varying from 3 to 10 days. The clinical recovery was slow. The history and technical examinations led to the diagnosis of basilar artery migraine (BAM). The etiology of the coma episodes is thought to be related to ischemic dysfunction of the rostral part of the brainstem due to severe spasm of the basilar artery demonstrated by arteriography. Exceptional are the recurrent prolonged coma episodes of sudden onset, the severe spasm of the basilar artery, and the suppression-burst and FIRDA pattern on the EEG examinations during the coma episodes. \nWhite sponge naevus and ocular coloboma. White sponge naevus occurred in association with coloboma of the iris in six members of one family, across three generations. The association of these two dominantly inherited conditions has not to our knowledge previously been described. \nEffects of short-term, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia on systemic hemodynamics, myocardial blood flow, and infarct size in awake dogs with acute myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. Short-term cholesterol feeding has been shown to affect vasomotor tone and increase infarct size in anesthetized rabbits. The purpose of the study was to determine whether acute hypercholesterolemia reduced collateral flow to ischemic myocardium and increased infarct size in the awake dog. METHODS AND RESULTS. Acute myocardial infarction was produced in awake dogs by a 4-hour left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 6-hour reperfusion after either a cholesterol-supplemented diet (n = 14) or a control diet of dog chow (n = 15) for 10 days. Infarct size was determined using nitroblue tetrazolium staining. In two subgroups, a 15-minute transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was produced before the diet treatments and was compared with occlusion after diet treatments, so that the effects of hypercholesterolemia of collateral flow could be determined by paired comparisons. Cholesterol feeding increased plasma cholesterol to 288 +/- 52 mg/dl, which was twofold to threefold that in the control group (127 +/- 35 mg/dl), but had no effects on baseline systemic hemodynamics and myocardial blood flow. Coronary artery occlusion produced similar increases in heart rate, mean aortic pressure, left atrial pressure, and plasma norepinephrine in both groups of animals. However, cholesterol feeding reduced collateral flow to ischemic myocardium and increased infarct size, compared with the control group. The infarct size correlated with ischemic myocardial blood flow in both groups, but the slopes of regression lines relating the two variables did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Short-term, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia increased infarct size in awake dogs. This change results, at least in part, from a decrease in collateral blood flow to ischemic myocardium during coronary artery occlusion. \nStress incontinence and cystoceles. We studied prospectively 62 women with cystoceles by video-urodynamics before and after operative repair. Of 29 women with grades 1 and 2 cystoceles 8 had residual urine, 14 had urge incontinence and 24 had symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. Of these women 23 had urodynamic evidence of stress incontinence, as did 3 of 5 without stress incontinence symptoms. Of 33 women with large cystoceles 22 had symptoms of stress urinary incontinence but 10 more had urodynamic evidence of stress urinary incontinence. Of these 33 women 18 had significant residual urine and 24 had urge incontinence. Operative repair resolved stress incontinence in 51 of 54 women, urge incontinence in 33 of 38 and residual urine in 24 of 26. Cystoceles recurred in 3 patients, and enteroceles developed in 3 and recurred in 2. These findings indicate that cystoceles may cause voiding dysfunction and lack of symptoms of stress incontinence is unreliable in patients with cystoceles. In addition, cystoceles are associated with other symptoms, most of which actually resolve after operative repair. \nCardiovascular and catecholamine responses to head-up tilt in the diagnosis of recurrent unexplained syncope in elderly patients. To increase understanding of the mechanisms causing syncope in patients over the age of 60, hemodynamic and hormonal responses to 60 minutes of 60 degree head-up tilt were examined in 10 patients with recurrent syncope of unknown origin and five controls with no history of syncope. Nine of 10 patients and all five controls experienced orthostatic intolerance on the tilt table. Syncope or pre-syncope occurred later in controls than in those syncope patients who had exact reproduction of their clinical symptoms (median time 52 versus 22 minutes, P = 0.05). Three different mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance were identified in the 14 subjects: (1) vasovagal syncope, n = 9 (sudden hypotension +/- bradycardia); (2) dysautonomic syncope, n = 3 (immediate and gradual parallel declines in both systolic and diastolic pressures with blunted increase in heart rate); (3) psychogenic or vestibular reaction, n = 2 (orthostatic intolerance without hemodynamic changes). Vasovagal syncope patients showed a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine from baseline to maximum level during tilt (100 +/- 39% increase, P = 0.03) and a subsequent decrease at the time of syncope (30 +/- 5% decrease, P = 0.01), while plasma epinephrine increased markedly from baseline to the time of syncope (827 +/- 154% increase, P = 0.0003). Dysautonomic syncope patients had lower supine levels of norepinephrine compared to vasovagal syncope patients (182 +/- 30 versus 614 +/- 146 pg/mL, P = 0.008) and no significant change in norepinephrine over time; epinephrine levels increased significantly less than in vasovagal patients (net change 38 +/- 8 versus 189 +/- 56 pg/mL, P = 0.008). \nCystoscopic suction diathermy for the treatment of superficial bladder tumours. The treatment of superficial bladder tumours (Ta, T1) is a time-consuming exercise for urological surgeons and patients. A method of treating the tumours, whether primary or recurrent, by endoscopic suction diathermy has been developed. The technique significantly reduces the amount of tumour debris within the bladder during treatment as well as the amount of diathermy employed. By removing the free tumour cells in the irrigation fluid the risk of tumour cell implantation may be kept to a minimum. \nThe t(1;22) (p13;q13) is nonrandom and restricted to infants with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group Study. We report the nonrandom occurrence and frequency of the t(1;22)(p13;q13) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its close association with the French-American-British M7 subtype of AML in infants (less than 1 year). This chromosomal abnormality occurred in 6 of 252 (2.4%) children and adolescents with AML (6 of 28 infants, 22%; 6 of 18 M7 AML cases overall, 33%; and 6 of 6 M7 cases in infants). Infants with AML of M7 subtype and the t(1;22) often presented with prominent abdominal masses. Two of these infants were not treated and died early. Three of four treated infants entered complete remission with therapy for AML; the remaining infant died of hemorrhage on day 8. Of the three infants who entered remission, only one remains alive and disease free at 5+ months. The other two infants relapsed in the bone marrow at 5 and 2 months from the start of therapy, respectively. We conclude that M7 AML with the t(1;22) usually presents in infants with extensive infiltration of abdominal organs by leukemic cells and may confer a poor prognosis despite intensive AML-directed treatment. Identification of this nonrandom translocation exclusively in infants with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMkL) implies that it may serve as an additional diagnostic marker for this disease and links it to the pathogenesis of AMkL in infants. \nPentoxifylline in resuscitation of experimental hemorrhagic shock. BACKGROUND: Pentoxifylline improves survival in animal models of hemorrhagic shock. The purpose of this study was to determine the physiologic effects of pentoxifylline in hemorrhagic shock that may be responsible for improved survival. METHODS: Randomized, prospective, blinded trials in Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to hemorrhage and resuscitation, with or without pentoxifylline. RESULTS: Pentoxifylline had no effect on BP or cardiac output. However, tissue oxygenation and oxygen consumption were increased with pentoxifylline resuscitation. Pentoxifylline resuscitation also significantly decreased polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Pentoxifylline improves tissue oxygenation and oxygen consumption posthemorrhage and this effect is not due to increased cardiac output. Therefore, it must be due to improved microcirculatory blood flow. This effect may be due to decreased polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesiveness induced by pentoxifylline resuscitation. \nAlcoholic liver disease: pathologic, pathogenetic and clinical aspects [published erratum appears in Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1991 Mar;15(2):180] Alcoholic liver disease includes steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Other liver diseases of genetic origin, but with a curious association with alcohol intake, are hemochromatosis and porphyria cutanea tarda. The attribution of chronic hepatitis to alcohol intake remains speculative, and the association may reflect hepatitis C infection. Hepatic injury attributed to alcohol includes the changes reported in the fetal alcohol syndrome. Steatosis, the characteristic consequence of excess alcohol intake, is usually macrovesicular and rarely microvesicular. Acute intrahepatic cholestasis, which in rare instances accompanies steatosis, must be distinguished from other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis (e.g., drug-induced) and from mechanical obstruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts (e.g., pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis) before being accepted. Alcoholic hepatitis (steatonecrosis) is characterized by a constellation of lesions: steatosis, Mallory bodies (with or without a neutrophilic inflammatory response), megamitochondria, occlusive lesions of terminal hepatic venules, and a lattice-like pattern of pericellular fibrosis. All these lesions mainly affect zone 3 of the hepatic acinus. Other changes, observed at the ultrastructural level, are of importance in progression of the disease. They include widespread cytoplasmic shedding, and capillarization and defenestration of sinusoids. Progressive fibrosis complicating alcoholic hepatitis eventually leads to cirrhosis that is typically micronodular but can evolve to a mixed or macronodular pattern. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in 5 to 15% of patients with alcoholic liver disease. The clinical syndrome of alcoholic liver disease is the result of three factors--parenchymal insufficiency, portal hypertension and the clinical consequences of extrahepatic damage produced by alcohol. At the several phases of the life history of alcoholic liver disease, the individual factors play a different role. The clinical manifestations of alcoholic steatosis are mainly extrahepatic in origin. Those of alcoholic hepatitis reflect mainly parenchymal insufficiency and those of cirrhosis are mainly those of portal hypertension. Alcoholic liver injury appears to be generated by the effects of ethanol metabolism and the toxic effects of acetaldehyde, perhaps the immune responses to alcohol- or acetaldehyde-altered proteins, and questionably enhanced by viral hepatitis. Alcoholic hepatitis may be mimicked histologically, and to a varying degree clinically, by a number of conditions (obesity, diabetes, several drug-induced injuries, jejunoileal bypass, and related \"shortcircuiting\" of the bowel). Perhaps the most important facet of the hepatotoxicity of alcohol is its enhancement of the effects of a number of other hepatotoxic agents, among which acetaminophen is the prime example. \nCorrelation of clinical and histopathologic features in clinically atypical melanocytic nevi. To define better the evolving entity of dysplastic melanocytic nevus (DMN), studies correlating clinical with histologic features of DMN are essential. However, based on a literature search, no previous quantitative analysis was found of the relationship between gross morphologic features and histologic features of DMN. The authors correlated individual clinical features with histopathologic features and histologic diagnosis of the clinically most atypical nevus in 153 melanoma patients. This nevus was identified, evaluated clinically, and removed for histologic evaluation from each patient. Gross morphologic features assessed for nevi included: size (in mm), the presence of a macular component, irregular border, ill-defined border, haphazard color",
