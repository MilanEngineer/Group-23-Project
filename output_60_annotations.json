The contraceptive effect of oral contraceptive use provides an important health benefit, particularly in developing countries, where the risks of pregnancy and childbearing are increased. Several important noncontraceptive health benefits of oral contraceptive use include the prevention of endometrial and ovarian cancers. Data are generally reassuring concerning the risks of oral contraceptive use, which include cardiovascular disease and breast and cervical cancer. \nMismatch of left ventricular function and infarct size demonstrated by technetium-99m isonitrile imaging after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction: identification of myocardial stunning and hyperkinesia. Quantitation of perfusion defect size using tomographic imaging with technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile was performed at the time of hospital discharge in 32 patients with a first myocardial infarction who underwent successful coronary reperfusion within 8 h of the onset of chest pain. Reperfusion was accomplished with thrombolysis or primary coronary angioplasty. Radionuclide angiography was performed at discharge and 6 weeks later. There was a close correlation between perfusion defect size and values for ejection fraction and regional wall motion both at discharge (r = -0.80 and -0.75, respectively) and 6 weeks later (r = -0.81 and -0.81, respectively). There was no overall group difference in ejection fraction between the value at discharge and at 6 weeks; however, five patients had a significant increase (greater than or equal to 0.08) and six had a significant decrease (greater than or equal to 0.08) in ejection fraction. In patients with a significant increase at 6 weeks, ejection fraction was significantly lower at discharge than the value predicted from perfusion defect size (0.37 +/- 0.09 measured versus 0.47 +/- 0.13 predicted, p less than 0.05) and it improved at 6 weeks to near predicted values (0.51 +/- 0.07). In patients with a significant decrease at 6 weeks, ejection fraction was significantly higher at discharge than the value predicted from perfusion defect size (0.60 +/- 0.10 measured versus 0.50 +/- 0.10 predicted, p less than 0.05) and it decreased at 6 weeks to near predicted levels (0.51 +/- 0.09). Left ventricular ejection fraction at the time of hospital discharge is a potentially misleading index of the efficacy of reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction. In a significant minority (34%) of patients this index does not accurately reflect perfusion defect size, apparently because of the effects of myocardial stunning and compensatory hyperkinesia. \nManagement of valvular heart disease: an illustrative cases approach. As indicated by the 22 illustrative cases included in this monograph, a stepwise approach to the assessment of valvular heart disease provides the information necessary to make good clinical decisions. The ECG and chest x-ray add useful information to the history and physical examination. Echocardiography, Doppler, and color flow Doppler techniques have an important role in defining the presence and severity of valvular stenosis and regurgitation. Nuclear techniques provide useful information about global biventricular systolic function, regional wall motion, and myocardial perfusion. Exercise testing is most valuable in confirming objectively the patient's functional status and exercise tolerance. Newer imaging techniques, such as cine CT and MRI, are capable of displaying and measuring cardiac chamber size and myocardial thickness; however, visualization of the cardiac valves and demonstration of flow abnormalities are difficult, limiting the current usefulness of these techniques in patients with valvular heart disease. \nDysphagia in psychiatric patients: clinical and videofluoroscopic study. Deaths due to airway obstruction are more common in psychiatric inpatients than in the normal population. A dysphagia program was started in a 400 bed Massachusetts psychiatric hospital after 4 patients in 1 year died from asphyxia. In the year after the program was started, there were no deaths; however, 28 patients experienced 32 choking incidents. The 28 patients received clinical evaluations by speech pathologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, and internists. Of the incidents, 55% required use of the Heimlich maneuver to open the airway. Choking incidents could be classified into five types based on results of clinical examination: bradykinetic, dyskinetic, fast eating syndrome, paralytic, and medical. Twenty-one of the 28 patients were studied by videofluoroscopy and 86% of the videos were abnormal, showing aspiration in eight, webs in five, and delay in the oral phase in five. Patients with bradykinetic dysphagia (secondary to neuroleptic-induced extra-pyramidal syndrome [EPS]) and paralytic dysphagia appeared to experience a more severe form of choking. \nFatigue and depression in the patient in the intensive care unit. The recognition, management, and treatment of fatigue and depression in the patient in the intensive care unit has been presented in a framework to allow consideration of intrapsychic, interpersonal, environmental, and disease factors that can be altered by various means. It is rare that fatigue so seriously complicates the primary illness as to be life threatening itself. Depression and delirium are associated with increased morbidity and mortality on their own; therefore, prompt attention to major depressive disorders and organic effective disorders is necessary. Through it all, attention to the person who has the disease with fatigue, depression, or both is essential. \nCircadian variation in the frequency of onset of chest pain in acute myocardial infarction. The time of onset of chest pain was studied prospectively in 1154 consecutive patients admitted to a coronary care unit with myocardial infarction during a five year period. Statistical analysis confirmed a previous finding in a retrospective study of a bimodal frequency distribution with peaks in the time of onset of chest pain between 2330 and 0030 hours and between 0630 and 0830 hours. \nBioelectric impedance analysis: experience with male patients with cirrhosis. Bioelectric impedance analysis is a new, convenient and portable method used to estimate total body water and to assess body composition in healthy people. We used the tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis method in 58 cirrhotic patients to assess its clinical applicability. Whole-body resistance, reactance and impedance were measured and compared with those of 30 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex. The resistance and impedance values of ascitic cirrhotic patients (resistance = 461 +/- 80 omega; impedance = 462 +/- 80 omega) and nonascitic cirrhotic patients (resistance = 487 +/- 96 omega; impedance = 489 +/- 97 omega) were comparable with the resistance (488 +/- 44 omega) and impedance (491 +/- 44 omega) of controls. However, a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in whole body reactance was found in patients with ascites and in those without ascites (34 +/- 9 omega vs. 47 +/- 12 omega) as compared with healthy subjects (56 +/- 7 omega). In 10 ascitic patients total body water was determined both before and after paracentesis; the volume of intraperitoneal fluid removed (7.9 +/- 3.8 L) could not be fully accounted for but only detected as an average volume of 1.9 +/- 1.0 L independently of the initial volume of the ascites. Our data clearly demonstrate that tetrapolar bioelectric impedance analysis is not adequate for measuring variations of \"compartmentalized\" fluid in the abdomen. \nSurvival and valve failure after aortic valve replacement. A prospective evaluation of 412 consecutive patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement between January 1982 and December 1985 was performed in an attempt to identify the determinants of survival and valve failure. A variety of valves were inserted to permit a prospective evaluation of alternative valves including: Bjork-Shiley mechanical (n = 37), Ionescu-Shiley pericardial (n = 261), Hancock pericardial (n = 78), and Carpentier-Edwards porcine (n = 36). Thirteen patients died in the hospital (3.2%) and 47 patients died in the follow-up period producing an actuarial survival of 81% +/- 3% at 48 months. Survival was independently predicted by advancing age, preoperative New York Heart Association functional class, and the presence of endocarditis (p less than 0.05 by Cox regression analysis). The majority of patients were symptomatically improved (New York Heart Association class I or II: 21% preoperative, 88% postoperative). Freedom from structural valve dysfunction, prosthetic valve endocarditis, and reoperation for valve-related complications were 95% +/- 2%, 95% +/- 2%, and 92% +/- 2% at 48 months, respectively. These valve-related complications occurred more frequently in younger patients and in those with a Hancock pericardial valve (freedom from structural valve dysfunction, 89% +/- 5%; prosthetic valve endocarditis, 84% +/- 9%; reoperation, 78% +/- 10%; p less than 0.05 by Cox regression). Freedom from thromboembolism was 88% +/- 2% at 48 months; it was significantly lower in patients with a preoperative thromboembolic event and was not influenced by the type of prosthesis inserted. Freedom from anticoagulant-related hemorrhage was 85% +/- 8% at 48 months and was not influenced by any preoperative factors. \nNational High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy This consensus report focuses the presentation, pathophysiology, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy expanding on recommendations first presented in 1988 by the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Practicing physicians should determine whether a patient's hypertension during pregnancy falls into the classification of (1) chronic hypertension, (2) preeclampsia, (3) preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, or (4) transient hypertension. The distinction, for management considerations, is made between hypertension that is present before pregnancy (chronic and preexisting) and that occurring as part of the pregnancy-specific condition preeclampsia. When maternal blood pressure reaches diastolic levels of 100 mm Hg or greater, treatment should be instituted to avoid hypertensive vascular damage. The report includes a discussion of antihypertensive therapy specific to the chronic or acute hypertension occurring concomitantly with pregnancy. The roles of calcium supplementation and low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia and chronic and transient hypertension are under investigation. \nClinical, physiologic, anatomic and procedural factors predictive of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In a recent prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trial, a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole was not associated with a reduction in the rate of restenosis within the 1st 6 months after coronary angioplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine whether clinical, anatomic or procedural factors were predictive of the observed restenosis rates in that prospective trial. A total of 247 patients and 280 segments underwent follow-up angiography and quantitative coronary angiographic analysis between 4 and 7 months after coronary angioplasty. Two baseline clinical characteristics--angina class and duration of angina in months--were related to the rate of restenosis by univariate analysis. Patient-related stepwise logistic regression analysis identified severity of angina as the only clinical predictor of restenosis. Three univariate baseline anatomic characteristics--percent diameter stenosis before angioplasty, stenosis greater than 10 mm in length and calcific stenosis--and two early postangioplasty characteristics--residual percent diameter stenosis and residual mean pressure gradient--were predictive of restenosis. Of these, only two--length of stenosis and residual percent diameter stenosis--were independently related to restenosis by multivariate analysis and only the former is identifiable before the procedure. It is concluded that in prospective studies in contrast to retrospective studies, few clinical and anatomic factors appear to be predictive of restenosis after coronary angioplasty. \nWhat is the role of the central nervous system in mineralocorticoid hypertension? The importance of the central nervous system (CNS) in the development of mineralocorticoid hypertension has been well documented. Type I receptors in adrenalectomized rats are concentrated in the hippocampus, amygdala, lateral septum, and hypothalamus, particularly in the periventricular regions, areas known to be or suspected of being important in the regulation of ACTH release, arousal, fluid and fluid osmolality equilibrium, and the maintenance of normal blood pressure. In the rat, ablation of the AV3V area and central, but not peripheral, sympathectomy prevent the development of DOCA-salt hypertension. The continuous intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of aldosterone in rats or dogs at doses which do not affect the blood pressure when administered subcutaneously (sc) produces significant increases in resting blood pressure. In rats this effect is dose dependent, blocked by the concomitant icv infusion of prorenone, an aldosterone antagonist, and enhanced, but not completely dependent upon renal mass reduction and excess salt consumption. The icv infusion of RU28318, a selective mineralocorticoid antagonist, at doses which are ineffective when administered sc, inhibits the development of hypertension produced by the sc infusion of aldosterone or deoxycorticosterone, as well as that produced by the oral administration of a licorice derivative and of a high salt diet in the Dahl S/JR rat. It is assumed that this effect is mediated through the mineralocorticoid receptor because it is inhibited by mineralocorticoid antagonists and because the icv infusion of RU26988, a selective glucocorticoid agonist, has no effect. The concomitant icv infusion of corticosterone, which is thought to be the primary ligand of the brain mineralocorticoid receptor, antagonizes the effect of icv infusion of aldosterone. \nEpidemiology of pain in New Zealand. Information on the prevalence of pain in the general population has relevance for the allocation of health services and for understanding of chronic pain. In 1986 a sample of 1498 adults were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Questions on pain were taken from the somatisation section of the interview schedule. These responses were used to determine the lifetime prevalence of pain in the urban population of New Zealand. The majority of subjects reported more than one life disrupting experience of pain. Pain was most common in the joints, back, head and abdomen. Women reported more pain than men. In general the prevalence of pain increased with age, however this was not true for headaches and abdominal pain. Most subjects related their pain symptoms to a physical cause. \nNational High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group report on hypertension and chronic renal failure. End-stage renal disease attributed to hypertension has increased annually for the last decade and will probably worsen through the year 2000. Patients with diabetic nephropathy and patients with hypertensive renal disease account for most new cases annually. Evidence reveals that all levels of untreated hypertension are associated with potentially declining renal function. Data from the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program and other studies show that antihypertensive treatment can prevent progressive renal failure. An ablation model demonstrates glomerular hyperfiltration as a possible mechanism for progressive renal failure. Human data on the renal effects of antihypertensive agents are limited and inconsistent. Despite the limitations, the Working Group on Hypertension and Chronic Renal Failure concludes that controlled hypertension to less than 140/90 mm Hg reduces the incidence of end-stage renal disease. Patients with established renal impairment may benefit from individualized treatment to 130/85 mm Hg or less. \nMyospherulosis. Complicating wound healing. Myospherulosis is a complication of wound healing which results from an action between lipids and extravasated erythrocytes. A case of myospherulosis of the mandible is reviewed with its history, histopathology and occurrence. \nClinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis with postoperative enteral feedings by needle catheter jejunostomy: an unusual complication. We evaluated the incidence of clinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis and intestinal necrosis with the use of needle catheter jejunostomy in 217 consecutive patients who had undergone complicated abdominal operations or selected bariatric procedures. The needle catheter jejunostomy was used to deliver immediate postoperative nutrition, maintenance, and replacement fluids, and selected medications. In this group, no serious complications requiring surgical intervention were related to the use of needle catheter jejunostomies. Clinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis was encountered in two of 217 patients (1%). With the needle catheter jejunostomy in place, both patients improved rapidly when enteral feedings were discontinued and parenteral antibiotics were administered. None of the 217 patients developed ischemic intestinal necrosis. We conclude that 1) clinically significant pneumatosis is a rare complication of enteric feeding via needle catheter jejunostomy when the intrajejunal feeding is begun with a diluted, hypoosmolar solution with stepwise increases in osmolality, and 2) patients who do develop clinically significant pneumatosis (n = 2) seem to respond rapidly to a temporary stoppage of enteral feedings and administration of parenteral antibiotics. \nCultured human bladder tumors for pharmacodynamic studies. Human bladder tumor fragments were cultured on collagen gel. In this system, the three dimensional architecture, cell-to-stroma and cell-to-cell interactions, and tumor heterogeneity were maintained. Cell viability and labeling index (LI) were determined by exposure to 3H-thymidine and autoradiography. Of the samples from 20 patients with transitional cell carcinoma, 14 (70%) were successfully cultured and had a mean LI of 32%. In addition, one specimen from a patient with squamous cell carcinoma was cultured and had a LI of 61%. Cultured samples were tested for chemosensitivity using a two hour exposure of mitomycin C in concentrations ranging from one to 50 micrograms./ml. A dose-dependent relationship was demonstrated; LI decreased as mitomycin C concentrations increased. The methodology described provides an alternative to suspension or monolayer techniques of culturing human bladder tumors for pharmacological studies. \nExperience with multiagent chemotherapy for osteosarcoma. Improved outcome. Clinical researches at the authors' institution have been treating patients with osteosarcoma with effective adjuvant chemotherapy for 18 years, including 14-years experience with limb-salvage surgery. The outlook for patients with nonmetastatic high-grade osteosarcoma has improved dramatically since 1972. Updated results of the single-agent adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy trial project a five-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14% to 70%) with follow-up periods of 5.7 to 13.8 years compared to a two-year DFS of 78% (60% to 95%) and follow-up periods of 0.6 to 6.8 years with six-agent, alternating, adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy. Additionally, since limb-salvage surgery began to be offered in 1976 to selected patients, 36 of 74 patients (49%) have had limb-salvage operations performed. The two-year DFS is 69% (52% to 85%) for patients having limb-salvage operations with follow-up periods of 0.6 to 10.3 years compared to 72% (57% to 87%) for amputees with follow-up periods of 0.3 to 10.3 years. It is concluded that patients receiving limb-salvage operations appear to be at no greater risk for relapse than patients receiving cross-bone amputation and that the administration of alternating, multiagent, adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly improved the DFS for patients who present with nonmetastatic high-grade osteosarcoma. \nPhase I-II trial of pentoxifylline for the prevention of transplant-related toxicities following bone marrow transplantation. Disease relapse and transplant related toxicities have limited the application of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in the treatment for hematologic malignancies. Because elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) have been correlated with the development of transplant related complications, we conducted a phase I-II trial of pentoxifylline (PTX), a xanthine derivative capable of down-regulating TNF-alpha production, in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing BMT. Thirty consecutive adult patients (median age, 34) were entered and received either an allogeneic (n = 26) or autologous (n = 4) BMT. Patients were enrolled at increasing dose levels (1,200, 1,600, and 2,000 mg/d) from day -10 through day +100 posttransplant. PTX was well tolerated with no significant adverse side effects noted at any of the dose levels administered. The actuarial day 100 survival for these 30 patients was 90% (95% confidence interval 79% to 100%). When compared with a good risk control group, PTX recipients experienced less mucositis (3.7 +/- 1.1 v 18.7 +/- 1.1 days, P = .004), less hepatic venocclusive disease (10% v 65%, P = .001), a lower incidence of renal insufficiency (3% v 65%, P = .0003), required less days of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (24.0 +/- 1.3 v 35.0 +/- 2.4, P = .001) and were discharged from the hospital earlier than controls (day 26.0 +/- 1.8 v 37.0 +/- 3.8, P = .01). In addition the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) greater than or equal to grade II was also reduced among the PTX recipients (35% v 68%, P = .03). PTX at doses in excess of 1,200 mg/d further reduced the severity of mucositis, and TPN requirements resulting in earlier hospital discharge than patients receiving 1,200 mg/d of PTX. In this study oral administration of PTX in doses up to 2,000 mg/d was well tolerated and associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing BMT. Prospective randomized trials are currently in progress to test these preliminary observations. \nGranulomatous renal mass during endovesical BCG therapy for bladder carcinoma. Diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration. One case of pseudotumoral granulomatous renal mass during endovesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy for superficial bladder neoplasm is reported. Such an adverse effect is exceptional and is clearly related to a vesicorenal reflux in our patient. In this case ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration was able to settle the diagnosis and avoid surgery. The patient responded to triple antituberculous therapy. \nIntranasal amphotericin B reduces the frequency of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients. PURPOSE: To retrospectively study the prophylaxis of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients and to relate the frequency of this fungal disease to any causal or modifying factors that could be identified. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1977 and 1988, 130 patients underwent 158 intensive treatment episodes to control acute leukemia, lymphoma, and aplastic anemia, and the frequency of complicating aspergillus infection was determined. RESULTS: Proven invasive aspergillus infections occurred in 22 cases, 12 of which were fatal. Invasive aspergillosis was suspected in a further 16 cases and all these patients recovered with amphotericin B treatment. Colonization by Aspergillus in the absence of clinically significant infection was seen in 31 treatment episodes. Invasive aspergillosis involved mainly the upper and lower respiratory tract and skin. Control of the infection was closely related to the control of the underlying disease, with subsequent return of normal marrow function and resolution of neutropenia. The incidence of aspergillus infection has decreased dramatically since 1985, most probably due to the introduction of intranasal amphotericin B. This occurred despite the persistence of aspergillus spores in the hematology ward air during the 1986 to 1988 period. CONCLUSION: Intranasal aerosolized amphotericin B may protect against invasive aspergillosis, even when neutropenic patients are cared for in conventional wards without HEPA filtration. \nHydronephrosis after aortofemoral bypass graft. A prospective study. This prospective study was designed to determine the frequency and natural history of hydroureteronephrosis (HUN) after placement of an aortobifemoral vascular graft. A total of 30 patients were evaluated by the study protocol, which included: pre and postoperative biological kidney function tests, preoperative and early postoperative (14th day) intravenous pyelograms and a late (mean 18th month) urologic examination by renal ultrasonic tomography. Four asymptomatic, early cases of HUN were observed in the 57 ureters examined (7%); all four complications regressed in less than 30 days. No cases of symptomatic early or late HUN were observed in this series. Asymptomatic early HUN was a frequent complication in our series (7%) but its benign course does not justify systematic screening. These asymptomatic complications contrast with the symptomatic cases of early or late HUN reported in the literature which necessitated urologic and vascular investigations. \nListeria meningitis and pate. Listeria meningitis occurred in a 63 year old man who was in complete haematological remission following chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia. The patient had followed Department of Health advice to immunocompromised patients and had avoided soft cheeses, cook-chill meals, and salads. He had, however, recently eaten pate produced in Belgium. This was no longer available for examination but a coincidental survey of pate in the Cardiff area found Listeria monocytogenes in 16 out of 73 samples. Pate should be included in the list of foods to be avoided by immunocompromised patients. \nStudies in autotomy: its pathophysiology and usefulness as a model of chronic pain. An interesting behavioral syndrome results in animals from the same or similar types of lesions that lead to deafferentation pain in humans; many neurectomized animals begin to scratch, bite, or self-mutilate their denervated limb, a phenomenon termed autotomy. The proposition that this behavior in animals is a response to the chronic pain of peripheral nerve injury has met with considerable controversy. If this issue were resolved, then a better understanding of the neurophysiology of autotomy might help elucidate the mechanisms of the human conditions. To determine the association between deafferentation and the autotomy behavior, we developed a pharmacologically induced functional deafferentation preparation using chronic perineural lidocaine infusion of the sciatic nerve. This 'chronic lidocaine' model's behavior was compared with that of the neurectomy model. While autotomy was noted in 80% of the latter group, no animal undergoing a chronic perineural infusion of lidocaine autotomized. We thus conclude that autotomy is not a response to non-painful sensory deafferentation, but rather that this behavior is a response to pain. We also studied the development of autotomy in a variety of other focal denervation preparations. On the basis of these data, we conclude that autotomy is not due to loss of sensory input on a functional basis nor to an action potential-mediated process. Rather, nerve damage which coincidentally involves sensory loss is necessary and sufficient for the development of this behavior. We suggest that interruption of a humoral feedback process homeostatically operating within the first order sensory neuron with its effect exerted post-synaptically leads to autotomy. The evidence supports the existence of a loss of a transportable, humoral autotomy inhibitory factor. \nBlood antibodies and uncrossmatched type O blood. The immediate transfusion of uncrossmatched type O blood in the initial resuscitation of the trauma victim remains controversial. To examine difficulties in crossmatching blood for later transfusions after use of uncrossmatched type O blood, we undertook a prospective 23-month study at a level I trauma center. One hundred thirty-five severely injured patients received uncrossmatched type O blood during the study period. Sixty-one patients (45%) died and 76 patients (56%) underwent emergent operation. There were no major transfusion reactions. Six patients had blood antigen-antibodies present on admission, and such antibodies developed in three patients during hospitalization. We conclude that uncrossmatched type O blood may be used safely in the exsanguinating patient, but blood antigen-antibodies, which may complicate later crossmatching, can develop after its use. \nA study of elastic tissue and actinic radiation in \"aging,\" temporal arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and atherosclerosis. The actinic storm in the modern world. Solar radiation provokes a lifelong series of destructive changes in the supporting elastic tissues of \"exposed\" skin. Called actinic elastosis/lysis (or actinic \"aging\"), the sequence begins in early life as simple elastic hyperplasia, converts in middle life to progressive actinic elastotic degeneration, and, in late life, typically ends with a stage of resorption (elastolysis) and atrophy (\"aged\" skin). Superficial \"exposed\" arteries such as the temporal artery participate in the same sequence of degenerative elastotic changes, which, as in the skin, may provoke granulomatous responses in a few of the many subjects affected. In the case of the temporal artery, a contingent outcome may be giant cell (temporal) arteritis and its recognized systemic vascular expression, polymyalgia rheumatica. Actinic commotion at the surface of the body is often massive in degree and extent and may be expected to exert a deleterious autoimmune impact on the essential elastic tissues of the arterial system. For this reason, solar radiation should be recognized as a risk factor for other elastic-related vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and aneurysms. Man-made radiations may be exacerbating the effects of predominant solar radiation. Of the many radiant bands that make up the actinic (electromagnetic) spectrum, little is known for certain about the identity of those that cause these prevalent disorders of elastic tissue. Until this void is filled, more care should be taken with solar and the other \"safe\" radiations. \nThe effects of recombinant human interferon-gamma on a panel of human bladder cancer cell lines. We have examined the Major Histocompatibility Complex class II antigen inducing capabilities of recombinant human interferon-gamma, on a panel of human transitional cell carcinoma lines which have been raised from original tumours of varying histological grades: RT4 (grade 1), RT112 (grade 2) and MGH-U1 (grade 3). Cells were examined for class II antigens using an indirect immunofluorescent staining method and analysed on a fluorescence activated cell sorter. Twenty percent of RT4 cells constitutively expressed class II antigen. Both RT112 and MGH-U1 were repeatedly found to be negative for this antigen prior to treatment with interferon-gamma. Following treatment with interferon-gamma all three lines showed an increase in class II antigen expression, which was consistently dependent on both the length of incubation and concentration of interferon-gamma. A differential susceptibility was found amongst the three cell lines which may relate to the histological grade of the parent tumor. \nOptochiasmal arachnoiditis following muslin wrapping of ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Optochiasmal arachnoiditis has been reported following treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms, particularly arising from the anterior communicating artery. It has been suggested that the accompanying loss of vision is due to a muslin-induced optic neuropathy. This paper considers five cases of this condition; the response to steroid therapy was beneficial in three cases. A review of the literature is included. The arachnoiditis is considered to be due to an inflammatory response to muslin gauze placed close to the optic nerves and chiasm. \nPotentially lethal complications of shigellosis. Complications that can lead to death during shigellosis include intestinal as well as systemic manifestations. The former include intestinal perforation, toxic megacolon, and dehydration, and the latter include sepsis, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, seizures and encephalopathy, hemolyticuremic syndrome, pneumonia, and malnutrition. Data on the frequency of these complications come primarily from hospital-based studies, in which sepsis-either with Shigella or with other Enterobacteriaceae-and hypoglycemia are the most common causes of death. Management of these two complications requires broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic treatment of all severely ill, malnourished patients with shigellosis as well as frequent feedings to prevent hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, in developing countries, access to parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents is often limited, and frequent feedings are often precluded by the severe anorexia that is characteristic of shigellosis. Realistic approaches to the reduction of mortality from shigellosis must continue to focus on prevention and early antimicrobial therapy rather than on treatment of established complications. \nAcute diverticulitis. A complicated problem in the immunocompromised patient. We reviewed the records of 209 patients with acute diverticulitis treated from 1984 through 1989 to determine if immunocompromised patients have a worse prognosis than nonimmunocompromised patients. Forty immunocompromised patients and 169 nonimmunocompromised patients with acute diverticulitis were identified. Free perforation into the peritoneal cavity occurred in 43% (17/40) of immunocompromised patients and 14% (24/169) of nonimmunocompromised patients. Operations were performed in 58% (23/40) of immunocompromised patients and 33% (55/169) of nonimmunocompromised patients. Postoperative morbidity was 65% (15/23) in immunocompromised patients and 24% (13/55) in nonimmunocompromised patients; postoperative mortality was 39% (9/23) and 2% (1/55), respectively. We conclude that acute diverticulitis in the immunocompromised patient is a complicated problem; there is a greater risk of free perforation and need for surgery than in the nonimmunocompromised patient. Furthermore, the prognosis for immunocompromised patients who undergo surgery is worse than that for nonimmunocompromised patients. \nThe effect of transcutaneous nerve stimulation on sphincter of Oddi pressure in patients with biliary dyskinesia. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has been postulated as a neuropeptide with inhibitory neurotransmitter activity in nonadrenergic noncholinergic pathways. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter in patients with achalasia. Such response is accompanied by a 30% increase in VIP concentrations in the systemic circulation. Since the sphincter of Oddi (SO) receives a very dense VIP nerve supply, we evaluate the effect of TENS on SO motor activity and on VIP plasma concentrations in patients with biliary dyskinesia and in healthy volunteers. TENS was performed with a pocket stimulator for 45 min. SO pressure and VIP levels were obtained before and after 45 min of TENS. In patients with SO dyskinesia, TENS produced a significant decrease in SO pressure from 80.1 +/- 11.9 mm Hg to 58.3 +/- 9.7 mm Hg p less than 0.01); this was accompanied by a significant increase in VIP plasma levels from 21.1 +/- 0.5 pg/ml to 32.6 +/- 1.5 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). In healthy volunteers, TENS did not produce significant changes in SO pressure. However, a significant increase in VIP plasma values was observed (p less than 0.01). No significant changes in amplitude, duration and frequency of SO phasic contractions were observed in either of the two groups evaluated. We conclude that, in patients with SO dyskinesia, TENS decreases SO basal pressure, possibly by a direct action of the released VIP in the systemic circulation. In healthy volunteers, TENS increases VIP plasma values without significant effect on SO basal pressure. These findings suggest that the response to TENS may be mediated by VIP. It is also possible that the alterations seen in patients with biliary dyskinesia may be due to impairment of the VIP nerve supply at the level of the SO. \nThe effect of diazepam enema on the rectal mucosa of rats. The use of undiluted intravenous diazepam solution administered as an enema has been recommended for the acute management of seizures when intravenous access cannot be obtained. It is well absorbed, rapidly effective, and generally accepted as being safe when used in this manner. The effect of intravenous diazepam solution on the rectal mucosa has not been studied. This study demonstrates that there are no acute changes in the rectal mucosa of adult rats after administration of 10 to 20 times the recommended human dose. \nMyocardial metabolic, hemodynamic, and electrocardiographic significance of reversible thallium-201 abnormalities in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND. Exercise-induced abnormalities during thallium-201 scintigraphy that normalize at rest frequently occur in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, it is not known whether these abnormalities are indicative of myocardial ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fifty patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy underwent exercise 201Tl scintigraphy and, during the same week, measurement of myocardial lactate metabolism and hemodynamics during pacing stress. Thirty-seven patients (74%) had one or more 201Tl abnormalities that completely normalized after 3 hours of rest; 26 had regional myocardial 201Tl defects, and 26 had apparent left ventricular cavity dilatation with exercise, with 15 having coexistence of these abnormal findings. Of the 37 patients with reversible 201Tl abnormalities, 27 (73%) had metabolic evidence of myocardial ischemia during rapid atrial pacing (myocardial lactate extraction of 0 mmol/l or less) compared with four of 13 patients (31%) with normal 201Tl scans (p less than 0.01). Eleven patients had apparent cavity dilatation as their only 201Tl abnormality; their mean postpacing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher than that of the 13 patients with normal 201Tl studies (33 +/- 5 versus 21 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between the angiographic presence of systolic septal or epicardial coronary arterial compression and the presence or distribution of 201Tl abnormalities. Patients with ischemic ST segment responses to exercise had an 80% prevalence rate of reversible 201Tl abnormalities and a 70% prevalence rate of pacing-induced ischemia. However, 69% of patients with nonischemic ST segment responses had reversible 201Tl abnormalities, and 55% had pacing-induced ischemia. CONCLUSIONS. Reversible 201Tl abnormalities during exercise stress are markers of myocardial ischemia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and most likely identify relatively underperfused myocardium. In contrast, ST segment changes with exercise and systolic compression of coronary arteries on angiography are unreliable markers of inducible myocardial ischemia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Apparent cavity dilatation during 201Tl scintigraphy may indicate ischemia-related changes in left ventricular filling, with elevation in diastolic pressures and endocardial compression. \nStructured lipid made from fish oil and medium-chain triglycerides alters tumor and host metabolism in Yoshida-sarcoma-bearing rats. The effects of structured lipid composed of fish oil and medium-chain triglycerides (Fish/MCT) on tumor and the host metabolism was compared with conventional long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) in Yoshida-sarcoma-bearing rats receiving TPN for 3 d. The two parenterally fed groups were divided into two treatments, saline or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), given intravenously at 20 micrograms/kg body wt. Changes in tumor volume, body weight, urinary nitrogen, whole-body and tissue protein kinetics, and fatty acid composition were measured. The study revealed that Fish/MCT feeding inhibited tumor growth, which could be attributed to decreased tumor protein synthesis. Body weight and nitrogen were better maintained by Fish/MCT feeding. In addition, the effects of Fish/MCT on tumor growth were synergistic with TNF treatment. The results demonstrate that dietary fat composition can influence fatty acid compositions of tumor tissue as well as tumor protein kinetics after a short period of TPN feeding. \nSclerosing vasculopathy of the central nervous system in nonelderly demented patients. Three nonelderly patients without hypertension whose clinical and radiologic features otherwise resembled Binswanger's subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy underwent biopsy of the hyperintense periventricular lesions seen on magnetic resonance imaging. The pathologic findings of the periventricular lesions consisted of gliosis with mild rarefaction and edema of the white matter. All patients had a sclerosing vasculopathy of unknown cause, which involved numerous small vessels within the periventricular lesions. The vessels stained negatively for amyloid, amyloid precursors, desmin, vimentin, keratin, immunoglobulin, and complement. On electron microscopy, small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries were characterized by swollen astrocytic foot processes surrounding the vessels; dense, perivascular collagen packing; crystalline arrays of filaments within basement membrane; giant lipid-laden lysosomes within perivascular cells; and narrowing of the vascular lumina. Similar changes were not seen in a control group of 19 patients. The pathologic features of the vessels in these cases are distinct from the vasculopathy associated with Binswanger's subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. We suggest that a spectrum of vasculopathies may be associated with dementia and periventricular hyperintense lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. \nCarcinomas with metaplasia and sarcomas of the breast. The clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometric characteristics of 34 cases of mammary carcinoma with metaplasia were compared with those of 20 cases of pure sarcoma of the breast. All 20 of the latter tumors showed the pattern of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. There were 20 cases of carcinoma with mesenchymal metaplasia, 7 cases of carcinoma with mixed epithelial (squamous) and mesenchymal metaplasia, and 7 cases of carcinoma with epithelial metaplasia (four mixed ductal/squamous and three pure squamous cell carcinomas). No patient with pure sarcoma had lymph node metastases develop; all nodal metastases were found in patients who had carcinoma with metaplasia, although in one case the carcinomatous component was seen only within a lymph node metastasis. Epithelial antigens were found not only within the epithelial elements of all cases of carcinoma, but also within the apparent mesenchymal elements of 44% of the carcinomas showing divergent differentiation. Flow cytometric analysis of eight cases of carcinoma with mesenchymal metaplasia showed aneuploidy/tetraploidy in six neoplasms. For patient management purposes, the distinction of pure sarcoma from carcinoma with metaplasia is important, but additional subclassification of carcinoma with metaplasia is of greater biologic than clinical interest. \nVery late recurrence of renal vasculitis. We report a case of renal vasculitis with a relapse occurring 9 and a half years after the original presentation. The plasma creatinine six months before relapse was only 118 mumol/l. During the initial illness there was histological evidence of glomerular damage but at the time of relapse renal biopsy showed the remaining glomeruli to be normal with the destructive process causing fibrinoid necrosis of arteries. \nMyasthenia gravis in mothers and their newborns. Myasthenia gravis is a complex autoimmune disorder. Anti-AChR antibodies destroy elements of the postsynaptic membrane of the myoneural junction in affected muscle groups. This results in decreased nerve-impulse transmission. Myasthenic patients have diminished skeletal muscle strength and tire rapidly with exercise. Pregnancy threatens maternal myasthenic exacerbation and crisis, particularly early in the puerperium. The medication requires frequent adjustment during pregnancy due to changing requirements and physiologic changes in absorption and excretion. Myasthenia results in an increase in maternal mortality, morbidity, pregnancy wastage, and premature labor. Anticholinesterase medications and corticosteroids are the mainstays of medical therapy of maternal MG. Thymectomy, plasmapheresis, immunosuppressant drugs, gamma globulin, and ACTH are adjuvants of varying usefulness. Enforced rest periods, a tranquil environment, and prompt treatment of intercurrent infections are important for myasthenic mothers. The management of myasthenic crisis requires hospital intensive care with mechanical respiratory support and careful monitoring of blood gases. Plasmapheresis is an effective means of controlling crises. It is usually combined with intensive steroid and or immunosuppressant therapy. The myasthenic mother undertakes pregnancy with increased risk to herself and her infant. There is a 40% chance of exacerbation of her MG during pregnancy and an additional 30% risk in the puerperium. Maternal mortality risk is approximately 40 per 1,000 live births. Perinatal mortality approximates 68 per 1,000 births, five times that of uncomplicated pregnancies. Modern management minimizes these risks to the extent that pregnancy is not precluded in myasthenic women. A good outcome depends on meticulous maternal and fetal prenatal surveillance and early detection and management of exacerbations. Facilities and trained personnel must be available to support labor and manage vaginal or operative delivery. Intensive care of myasthenic crises is critical to the prevention of maternal complications and death. \nPlexiform granular cell odontogenic tumor: unicystic variant. Plexiform granular cell odontogenic tumor of the mandible has recently been described. The cardinal histopathologic feature, as its name suggests, is a monophasic plexiform pattern of granular cells; the principal tumor in the differential diagnosis is granular cell ameloblastoma. Unlike the two previously reported cases of plexiform granular cell odontogenic tumor, which occurred as solid tumors in elderly men, the lesion reported here is a unicystic variant occurring in a middle-aged woman. \nThe effects of neurokinin A, neurokinin B, and eledoisin on substance P analysis. Commercial sources for neuropeptide radioimmunoassays have made this sensitive tool available to clinical investigators for monitoring the potential involvement of neuropeptides in pain modulation. We measured substance P-like immunoreactivity in the plasma, saliva, and pericardial fluid of subjects with and without pain (chronic and acute) to determine if substance P levels are altered. Some recent studies have suggested that substance P in various body fluids may be a correlate of chronic pain. To test this correlation it is important to ensure that the assay is measuring what it was designed to measure. Therefore, the influence of three tachykinins on the analysis of substance P concentrations was assessed with a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit. A small (approximately 2 to 6%), apparently nonspecific elevation in measured substance P was found when alpha-neurokinin, beta-neurokinin, or eledoisin was incubated with substance P and its antibody. Our results also indicate an apparent specific affinity of the substance P antibody for alpha-neurokinin (above 1,000 pg/ml) and beta-neurokinin (above 5,000 pg/ml). Substance P levels in the body fluids we tested ranged from 0.47 to 62.88 pg/mg protein (47.4 to 230.8 pg/ml). Levels of the tested tachykinins have not been determined in body fluids. If alpha-neurokinin or beta-neurokinin is found to be present in high concentrations in these fluids, this commercially available substance P kit may overestimate substance P levels. The concentrations of tachykinins necessary to interfere specifically with the assay are 10- to 100-fold higher than substance P in body fluids. \nHypoxemia is associated with mitochondrial DNA damage and gene induction. Implications for cardiac disease OBJECTIVE.--Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency due to hypoxemia or other causes was hypothesized to increase oxygen radical generation, damage mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and reduce adenosine triphosphate synthesis, resulting in compensatory OXPHOS gene induction. Therefore, we investigated the levels of mtDNA damage and OXPHOS transcripts in normal and ischemic hearts, and then in other forms of heart disease. DESIGN.--DNA was extracted from the heart and the levels of the common 4977 base pair mtDNA deletion were quantitated as an index for mtDNA damage. Total RNA was extracted from hearts and analyzed for OXPHOS transcript levels. RESULTS.--In control hearts, the 4977 base pair mtDNA deletion appeared at age 40 years and reached a maximum deletion of 0.0035%. Much higher levels were found in ischemic hearts (0.02% to 0.85%), as well as in three of 10 cases with other types of heart disease (0.017% to 0.16%). The OXPHOS transcripts were increased in all diseased hearts. CONCLUSION.--Ischemic hearts have increased mtDNA damage and OXPHOS gene expression, suggesting that mtDNA damage is associated with OXPHOS deficiency. Oxidative phosphorylation defects may also play a role in some other forms of cardiac disease. \nStereotactic multiple arc radiotherapy. A radiotherapy technique is presented for delivering a concentrated pattern of absorbed dose to intracranial lesions. Treatment takes place on a conventional, isocentrically mounted linear accelerator, rotated in several planes around a single target site. A new, relocatable stereotactic frame is used which enables fractionated radiotherapy to be administered if required. Calculations of the absorbed dose distribution in three orthogonal planes are performed using specially prepared software on a computer used for standard treatment planning. In this way, the need for excessive computing power is avoided. \nHypothermia in the summer. We have presented two cases of hypothermia associated with altered mental status occurring during the summer in the sunbelt. Both cases represent nonexposure hypothermia of multifactorial origin requiring prompt aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. The effects of phenothiazines, alcoholism, Wernicke's encephalopathy, Parkinson's disease, and altered mental status contributed to the development of hypothermia in these instances. Although both patients survived and were discharged from the hospital, it is likely that hypothermia in such situations has a higher mortality. Awareness of the broad differential of predisposing conditions is mandatory in treating such patients in a timely fashion. \nA quantitative approach to radiography of the lower limb. Principles and applications. A method is described which provides standardised reproducible radiographic images of the lower limb. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs are digitised and processed by computer to provide graphic/numeric displays of angles and linear measurements, relating the centre points of the hip, knee, and ankle. Two cases illustrate how surgical planning is facilitated when standardised data are available. These data confirm the close relationship between postoperative limb alignment and positioning of prosthetic elements. \nThe Edmonton injector: a simple device for patient-controlled subcutaneous analgesia. In a prospective open study we tested the Edmonton injector (EI), a device designed by our group for subcutaneous injection of narcotics. In 25 patients, the EI was used for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA); mean duration of treatment was 28 +/- 10 days. Mean equivalent daily dose of morphine was 160 +/- 85 mg. All patients found the EI safe and simple to operate. The main reason for discontinuation was death (10 cases) or return to oral narcotics (8 cases). In 20 patients who were admitted to the hospital and were too ill to learn PCA, the EI was used for regular s.c. administration by nurses. Narcotics were administered every 4 h and extra doses were administered on a 'PRN' basis. Waiting time for a 'PRN' dose in 8 patients before starting the EI was 18 +/- 7 min; after the EI was started, it was 3 +/- 4 min (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the EI is safe, effective and inexpensive, and that it will be particularly useful in smaller hospitals and developing countries. \nLiquid-propane freeze injury: a case history. Exposure of skin to liquid propane causes a severe freeze injury. This cutaneous injury has the appearance of a partial-thickness thermal injury of indeterminate depth, but the deep tissue damage is greater than is at first apparent. A case history is presented that illustrates the severity of this particular mechanism of injury and the need for adequate safety precautions. \nAcid secretory changes and early relapse following duodenal ulcer healing with ranitidine or sucralfate. Controversial aspects relating to acid secretory changes following duodenal ulcer healing, and the effect of histamine-2 (H2)-receptor blockers on such changes are discussed. Recent studies comparing the effects of ranitidine or sucralfate on changes in the acid secretory responses in the healing of duodenal ulcers are described, and the relevance of these changes to early relapse considered. The duration of therapy and timing of acid-secretory studies and endoscopies are standardized in all studies, but the acid-secretory parameters vary. These comprised acid secretory responses to graded doses of an intravenous infusion of pentagastrin or histamine, sham-feeding responses, and basal and nocturnal acid secretion. In all studies, healing with sucralfate was associated with a significant decrease in the various parameters of acid secretion. In the ranitidine-healed groups, no appreciable decrease was noted and there was, indeed, a significant increase in nocturnal acid secretion. Routine endoscopies performed 4-6 weeks after documented ulcer healing showed a recurrence of 3 of the 32 (9%) sucralfate-healed and in 14 of the 35 (40%) ranitidine-healed ulcers. Increased acid secretory responsiveness following duodenal ulcer healing was strongly correlated with subsequent early relapse. \nSelection of the approach to the distal internal carotid artery from the second cervical vertebra to the base of the skull. Although several approaches for exposure of distal internal carotid artery lesions have been reported, the precise anatomic levels for which each of these maneuvers are most appropriate have not been well described. Since these techniques may require preoperative preparation, it is useful to determine in advance how much exposure will be needed and to select the most suitable and effective technique. We used anatomic dissection in 12 human cadaver specimens (24 carotid bifurcations) to define the limits of distal internal carotid artery exposure by several commonly advocated methods. The standard anterior approach along the sternocleidomastoid muscle allowed exposure of the internal carotid artery to the level of the upper one third of the second cervical vertebra. The upper limit of this exposure was extended to the middle of the first cervical vertebra by division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Anterior subluxation of the mandible increased the distal exposure of the internal carotid artery to the superior border of the first cervical vertebra. Styloidectomy in combination with the preceding maneuvers extended the exposure an additional 0.5 cm cephalad. Lateral mandibulotomy did not significantly extend exposure beyond that obtained with mandibular subluxation and styloidectomy. Exposure of the internal carotid artery in the 1 cm immediately below the base of the skull required a posterior approach with mastoidectomy. \nEffects of calcium antagonists on glomerular hemodynamics and structure in experimental hypertension. The RK, DS, and UNX SHR rats are related models of progressive renal disease characterized by the presence of severe systemic hypertension and reduction in renal mass. In these models, glomerular injury is related to increased glomerular pressure and to kidney and glomerular hypertrophy. As summarized in Table 1, administration of a calcium antagonist reduces the prevalence of glomerular sclerosis in all three models. Calcium antagonists have many effects that might tend to reduce renal injury. Similar to the ACE inhibitors, they may reduce PGC, although a protective effect has been observed in some models despite persistence of marked glomerular capillary hypertension. Calcium antagonists also appear to inhibit compensatory renal growth. The observation that these drugs lessen injury in experimental hypertension has important implications for the treatment of patients with hypertension and renal disease. However, widespread use of calcium antagonists specifically to prevent kidney damage should await the results of controlled clinical trials. \nAcute fulminant hepatic failure. Fulminant hepatic failure is the rapid onset of life-threatening hepatic decompensation in patients who have no previous history of liver disease. This condition has a multifactorial etiology, including viral hepatitis and drug toxicity. At this time there is no specific therapy for FHF. However, early diagnosis and treatment of the complications--in particular, cerebral edema--may prolong survival and prevent irreversible neurologic complications. Once the diagnosis has been made, patients with FHF should promptly be transferred to a specialized liver care unit where liver transplantation is available. Liver transplantation is now the treatment of choice for patients with clinical characteristics suggesting a poor chance of survival. \nProblems encountered with the Bethesda System: the University of Iowa experience. This paper provides a descriptive summary of 1 year's experience with the Bethesda Cytologic Classification System at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Cytotechnologists and pathologists criticized the failure of the new classification system to provide microscopic criteria for the following categories: adequacy of the smear (satisfactory, less than optimal, unsatisfactory), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance, and inflammation-associated changes. Clinicians criticized the \"less than optimal\" category and the reporting of koilocytosis, moderate dysplasia, and endometrial cells. Suggestions for modifying the Bethesda System include: eliminating the less than optimal response, defining what constitutes an unsatisfactory smear, eliminating the terms low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and changing the reporting of endometrial cells. \nMicroglandular adenosis of the breast. An immunohistochemical comparison with tubular carcinoma. Microglandular adenosis (MA) of the breast is a benign, disorganized proliferation of glands lined by a single layer of cells. As such, differential diagnosis between MA and tubular carcinoma may be challenging in selected cases. A panel of antibodies was applied to 10 cases of MA and 10 of tubular carcinoma to investigate the potential benefit of immunohistochemistry in the separation of these lesions and the possible role of myoepithelial cells in MA. The luminal cells in nine cases of MA were surrounded by a cuff of muscle-specific actin-reactive cells, which also coexpressed cytokeratin and vimentin. The immunophenotype of these cells is characteristic of myoepithelial differentiation, which was heretofore thought to be lacking in MA. This finding demonstrates that myoepithelial cells are indeed present in MA subjacent to luminal epithelial cells; moreover, it distinghuishes MA from tubular carcinoma, all examples of which were actin negative in this analysis. In addition, circumferential type IV collagen deposition was observed around constituent glands of MA in nine cases but was lacking in all tubular carcinomas. Other markers included in this evaluation (S100 protein, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, carcinoembryonic antigen, estrogen receptor protein) were of no differential diagnostic value. \nPropranolol in the prevention of the first hemorrhage from esophagogastric varices: A multicenter, randomized clinical trial. The Boston-New Haven-Barcelona Portal Hypertension Study Group. To assess the effectiveness of propranolol in the prevention of initial variceal hemorrhage, a double-blind, randomized trial was carried out in three centers. Patients with cirrhosis (78% alcoholic), hepatic venous pressure gradients greater than 12 mm Hg and endoscopically proven esophageal varices were randomly assigned to propranolol (51 patients) or placebo (51 patients). Of the 102 patients, 58% were Child's class A, 34% were Child's class B and 8% were Child's class C. Daily dosage was determined by the administration of progressively increasing doses of propranolol with the hepatic vein catheter in place to achieve a 25% decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient, a decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient to less than 12 mm Hg or a decrease in resting heart rate to less than 55 beats/min. During a mean follow-up period of 16.3 mo, 11 patients in the placebo group (22%) bled from esophageal varices compared with 2 in the propranolol group (4%) during a mean period of 17.1 mo (p less than 0.01). Three additional patients (6%) in the placebo group bled from portal hypertensive gastropathy compared with none in the propranolol group. Propranolol appeared effective in preventing bleeding from large varices. Eleven deaths (22%) occurred in the placebo group compared with eight deaths (16%) in the propranolol group (NS). The mean dose of propranolol was 132 mg/day, and the median dose was 80 mg/day. Using a compliance index (pill count, clinic attendance, alcohol and propranolol levels and alcohol history), 81% of the propranolol patients and 77% of the placebo patients were considered compliant. Complications severe enough to require cessation of therapy occurred in eight patients (16%) in the propranolol group and four in the placebo group (8%) (NS). We conclude that propranolol effectively prevents the first variceal hemorrhage in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices but does not improve survival. \nStump pressure, the contralateral carotid artery, and electroencephalographic changes. Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and measurement of stump pressure are the most widely employed methods of assessing the risk of cerebral ischemia during carotid endarterectomy. The status of the contralateral carotid artery has also been thought to influence the need for placing a shunt. The relationship of EEG monitoring, stump pressure, and the contralateral carotid artery has not been completely delineated. We retrospectively reviewed these three variables in 113 patients undergoing 124 carotid endarterectomies. The contralateral artery was classified as occluded, stenotic (greater than 50% decrease in diameter), or nonstenotic. There was a 48% incidence of EEG changes with contralateral occlusion, 18% with stenosis, and 21% with nonstenotic arteries (p = 0.014). There was a 73% incidence of EEG changes when the stump pressure was less than 25 mm Hg, 32% when the stump pressure was 25 to 50 mm Hg, and 2% when the stump pressure was greater than 50 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean stump pressure for patients with occlusion (43.8 mm Hg), stenosis (44.7 mm Hg), or nonstenotic contralateral arteries (51.3 mm Hg). All patients with contralateral occlusion and a stump pressure less than 25 mm Hg had EEG changes. No patient with a stump pressure greater than 50 mm Hg and a patent contralateral artery had EEG changes. Although the incidence of EEG changes in the majority of patients was not accurately predicted by the stump pressure and the status of the contralateral carotid artery, stump pressure less than or equal to 50 mm Hg was sensitive, identifying 97% of patients with EEG changes. \nMalignant lymphoma of the urinary bladder. A case with signet-ring cells simulating urachal adenocarcinoma. We describe a malignant lymphoma involving the dome and anterior wall of the urinary bladder in an elderly woman. The initial biopsy showed a malignant neoplasm of uncertain cell type. Because the clinical presentation was most compatible with urachal adenocarcinoma, an extensive resection was performed. Microscopically, the excised tumor was composed of large lymphoid cells with isolated and clustered signet-ring cells. Immunohistochemical analysis established the B-cell phenotype of the neoplasm, and electron microscopy of the signet-ring cells revealed endoplasmic reticulum-bound inclusions consistent with immunoglobulin. Primary malignant lymphomas of the urinary bladder are rare, and, to our knowledge, we report the first example with signet-ring cells. We emphasize this histopathologic finding because of the potential for confusion with urachal adenocarcinoma. \nIs adult-onset coeliac disease due to a low-grade lymphoma of intraepithelial T lymphocytes? Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma commonly presents with malabsorption, and debate continues as to whether adult-onset coeliac disease (CD) is itself a form of low-grade lymphoma. A 59-year-old man with adult-onset CD required resection of a segment of oedematous jejunum. Histological examination of this tissue revealed an intense intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Immunophenotypic (CD3-, CD4-, CD8-, CD34-, and CD45 RO-) and cytogenetic (deletion of the Y chromosome and chromosome 9) abnormalities were found, together with monoclonal T-cell-receptor gene rearrangements. Some patients with adult-onset CD may have low-grade lymphoma from the outset of their illness. \nTreatment of chronic pain by epidural spinal cord stimulation: a 10-year experience. Epidural spinal cord stimulation by means of chronically implanted electrodes was carried out on 121 patients with pain of varied benign organic etiology. In 116 patients, the pain was confined to the back and lower extremities and, of these, 56 exhibited the failed-back syndrome. Most patients were referred by a pain management service because of failure of conventional pain treatment modalities. Electrodes were implanted at varying sites, dictated by the location of pain. A total of 140 epidural implants were used: 76 unipolar, 46 Resume electrodes, 12 bipolar, and six quadripolar. Patients were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to 10 years, with a mean follow-up period of 40 months. Forty-eight patients (40%) were able to control their pain by neurostimulation alone. A further 14 patients (12%), in addition to following a regular stimulation program, needed occasional analgesic supplements to achieve 50% or more relief of the prestimulation pain. Pain secondary to arachnoiditis or perineural fibrosis following multiple intervertebral disc operations, when predominantly confined to one lower extremity, seemed to respond favorably to this treatment. Uniformly good results were also obtained in lower-extremity pain secondary to multiple sclerosis. Pain due to advanced peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs was well controlled, and amputation below the knee was delayed for up to 2 years in some patients. Pain due to cauda equina injury, paraplegic pain, phantom-limb pain, pure midline back pain without radiculopathy, or pain due to primary bone or joint disease seemed to respond less well. Patients who responded to preliminary transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation generally did well with electrode implants. Notable complications included wound infection, electrode displacement or fracturing, and fibrosis at the stimulating tip of the electrode. Three patients in this series died due to unrelated causes. Epidural spinal cord stimulation has proven to be an effective and safe means of controlling pain on a long-term basis in selected groups of patients. The mechanism of action of stimulation-produced analgesia remains unclear; further studies to elucidate it might allow spinal cord stimulation to be exploited more effectively in disorders that are currently refractory to this treatment modality. \nCine magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis of right coronary arterial-ventricular fistula. In two cases of coronary arterial-ventricular fistula, detailed morphologic evaluation of the affected coronary artery was performed by MRI. Cine-MRI enabled both identification of the fistula and evaluation of the direction of shunt blood flow. Thus, MRI is a valuable noninvasive procedure in the anatomic and physiologic diagnosis of coronary arterial fistula. \nRoot of the superior mesenteric artery in pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma: evaluation with CT To determine if changes involving the root of the superior mesenteric artery are specific for neoplasm, the authors retrospectively reviewed 173 computed tomographic (CT) examinations of patients with proved pancreatitis (103 examinations) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (70 examinations). Streaky infiltration of the fat surrounding the root was seen in 27 of 56 examinations of acute pancreatitis, in four of 24 examinations of chronic pancreatitis, in 12 of 23 examinations of pancreatitis complicated by abscess, and in 25 of 70 examinations of pancreatic carcinoma. Periarterial lymph nodes were visible in 14 with acute pancreatitis, in three with chronic pancreatitis, in six with pancreatic abscess, and in 11 with pancreatic carcinoma. A focal mass extended to within 1 cm of the root in 10 with acute pancreatitis, in two with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, and in 24 with pancreatic carcinoma; the mass obliterated the periarterial fat in seven with acute pancreatitis, in one with pancreatic abscess, and in 18 with pancreatic carcinoma. Circumferential encasement occurred in one with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, in 14 with pancreatic carcinoma, and in none with acute pancreatitis; nearly all cases of encasement revealed loss of periarterial fat. Thus, these indicators are not specific for neoplasm. \nStudy of belching ability in antireflux surgery patients and normal volunteers. The ability to belch was evaluated by a novel test, after gaseous stomach distension to standard volume, in 16 patients after antireflux surgery and nine healthy volunteers. A structured assessment of dyspeptic symptoms was also carried out in both groups. Repeat studies in volunteers showed acceptable reproducibility for the new test of belching capacity (within-subject coefficient of variance 4.5 per cent). After antireflux surgery, patients had lower volume individual belches (median(range) 27.5(0-104) ml in patients versus 76(15-165) ml in volunteers; P less than 0.02) and belched less gas within 1 h of the stimulus than volunteers (median(range) 205(0-1363) ml in patients versus 456(45-818) ml in volunteers; P less than 0.05). Belching frequency was similar in both groups. The incidence and severity of symptoms were unrelated to belched gas volumes. \nPlatelet-free calcium and vascular calcium uptake in ethanol-induced hypertensive rats. This study examined the effect of moderate ethanol intake on systolic blood pressure, platelet cytosolic free calcium, aortic calcium, and rubidium-86 uptake in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Twelve Wistar-Kyoto rats, aged 6 weeks, were given 5% ethanol in drinking water the first week followed by 10% ethanol in drinking water for the next 6 weeks. Twelve control animals were given regular tap water. Systolic blood pressure in the ethanol-treated rats was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that in controls after 1 week and remained higher throughout the study. At 13 weeks of age, platelet cytosolic free calcium and calcium uptake by aortas were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in ethanol-treated animals as compared with those in controls. Ethanol intake did not affect aortic ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake. The in vitro effect of ethanol on calcium-45 and 86Rb uptake was also investigated in aortas of untreated Wistar-Kyoto rats at 13 weeks of age. In vitro ethanol (2.5-20 mmols/l) did not significantly affect 45Ca and 86Rb uptake in rat aortas. The increases in systolic blood pressure, platelet cytosolic free calcium, and vascular calcium uptake suggest that increases in cytosolic free calcium and calcium uptake mechanisms are associated with ethanol-induced hypertension. \nEstimating the likelihood of severe coronary artery disease. PURPOSE: To determine which clinical characteristics obtained by a physician during an initial clinical examination are important for estimating the likelihood of severe coronary artery disease, and to determine whether estimates based on these characteristics remain valid when applied prospectively and in different patient groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined clinical characteristics predictive of severe disease in 6,435 consecutive symptomatic patients referred for suspected coronary artery disease between 1969 and 1983. RESULTS: Eleven of 23 characteristics were important for estimating the likelihood of severe coronary artery disease. A model using these characteristics accurately estimated the likelihood of severe disease in an independent sample of 2,342 patients referred since 1983. The model also accurately estimated the prevalence of severe disease in large series of patients reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the clinician's initial evaluation can identify patients at high or low risk of anatomically severe coronary artery disease. Cost-conscious quality care is encouraged by identifying patients at higher risk for severe coronary artery disease who are most likely to benefit from further evaluation. \nCost and benefit of secondary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. OBJECTIVE--To determine the relative cost and benefit of aerosolized pentamidine and the combination product of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim sulfate as secondary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. DESIGN--A Markov-based cost-benefit analysis was performed. Drug efficacies, toxicities, and mortality rates were drawn from the current literature. SETTING--Hypothetical. PATIENT POPULATION--Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus who had had at least one episode of P carinii pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS--Regimen 1 required the use of aerosolized pentamidine as the sole first-line prophylactic agent in all patients. Regimen 2 required the use of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in all patients who had no history of a toxic reaction to the drug; only patients with a history of toxic effects and those who developed toxic effects while receiving the drug would receive aerosolized pentamidine. Regimen 3 required that no secondary prophylaxis be given. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Net cost, median patient survival, and 5-year survival for each regimen and for regimens 1 and 2 compared with regimen 3. MAIN RESULTS--Regimen 2 was dominant, with a net cost of $6332 per patient and a median survival of 2.050 years. Compared with no prophylaxis, regimen 2 resulted in a savings of $16,503 per patient and a 0.696-year increase in median survival. Compared with regimen 1, regimen 2 resulted in a savings of $2904 and a 0.067-year increase in median survival. CONCLUSIONS--Secondary prophylaxis for P carinii saves money and extends survival. Current data suggest that sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim should be given whenever it can be tolerated. Use of aerosolized pentamidine as a first-line agent would result in a modest increase in cost and a decrease in life expectancy. \nSmall bowel obstruction after colon resection for benign and malignant diseases. To determine the etiology and outcome of patients with small bowel obstruction after a colon resection for benign and malignant diseases, the medical records of 118 patients who underwent 120 laparotomies for small bowel obstruction were reviewed. Contrary to previous reports, benign adhesions were responsible for the obstruction in all patients with a history of benign colon disease, 82.6 percent of patients with a history of adenocarcinoma of the colon without known recurrence, and 30.1 percent of patients with known recurrent malignancy. The morbidity and mortality was more related to the etiology of the obstruction rather than the preoperative delay or operative procedure performed. Considering the high likelihood of adhesive obstruction in patients with a history of, or known, metastatic colorectal carcinoma, it is suggested that these not deter surgeons from aggressive early surgical intervention in these patients who develop small bowel obstruction. \nEpidemiological characteristics of subarachnoid hemorrhage in an urban population. Several risk factors for unfavorable outcome from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have been identified. The prevalence of such risk factors varies among ethnic groups and among men and women. The influence of ethnic background and gender as factors in the outcome after SAH has not been adequately studied and is the focus of the present investigation. Outcome in 145 consecutive patients was dichotomized as good and moderately disabled vs severely disabled, vegetative, and dead. A multiple logistic regression model was used to examine the factors of gender, ethnic group (white and non-white), age, admission neurological grade, pre-existing hypertension, and intravenous drug abuse. Our data reveal that hypertensive, white males, with a history of intravenous drug abuse, have a high risk of unfavorable outcome following SAH. These observations are important for the design and interpretation of future studies relating to SAH. \nIodine-125 interstitial implants as salvage therapy for recurrent gynecologic malignancies. Twenty-one patients with the diagnosis of recurrent gynecologic pelvic malignancy from various primary sites were treated with iodine-125 (I-125) interstitial implants. Eighteen of these patients had been treated with a combination of surgery and radiation therapy for their primary malignancies and 90% had responded. Seventy-five percent had complete local responses. The overall survival time, volume-response relationship, and complications are discussed and the radioresponse of various histologic types is presented. \nDelayed presentation and treatment of popliteal artery embolism. In the course of reviewing a 10-year experience with popliteal artery embolism (PAE), two distinct patterns of clinical presentation were identified. In addition to those patients presenting with typical acute (symptom duration less than 7 days) arterial ischemia, a second group was identified who presented with more chronic symptoms. The present study was conducted to contrast the clinical factors and treatment of these two temporal patterns of presentation with PAE. Sixty PAEs in 58 patients were documented by the combination of angiography and/or exploration of the popliteal artery. Acute presentation (AP) was seen in 41 (68%) of these and delayed presentation (DP) was noted in 19 (32%) patients. Delayed presentation patients typically presented with a history of sudden onset of claudication or rest pain and a median symptom duration of 30 days. Eighty per cent of AP patients presented with immediately threatened limbs. Angiography was generally diagnostic of chronic popliteal embolism. In the acute group, 90% were treated with embolectomy alone, while 20% of the DP group required bypass grafting. However in two thirds of the DP group, embolectomy alone performed through a direct popliteal approach was possible. Current results with overall limb salvage (92%) and mortality (7%) represents a substantial improvement compared to the authors' previous experience with PAE. The current study suggests that as many as one third of patients with popliteal artery embolism may present in delayed fashion with chronic symptoms. Furthermore most of these patients can be treated with direct popliteal embolectomy alone with favorable results. \nPatterns of morbidity and mortality in typhoid fever dependent on age and gender: review of 552 hospitalized patients with diarrhea. Features of typhoid fever were correlated with age and gender through a review of the charts of 552 hospitalized culture-positive patients with diarrhea in Bangladesh. Seizures occurred more frequently in children from birth through 10 years of age (5%-11%) and pneumonia more frequently in children from birth through 5 years of age (8%-15%) than in older age groups (P less than .05), whereas intestinal perforation occurred more frequently in patients greater than or equal to 11 years of age (5%-25%) than in younger age groups (P less than .005). Compared with older age groups, children from birth through 10 years of age were more anemic, those from birth through 5 years of age had a higher mean white blood cell count, and those from birth through 1 year of age had a lower mean blood carbon dioxide content (all P less than .05). Female patients were more severely anemic than male patients (P less than .05). The case-fatality rate was 4.3% overall, with the highest rates for children from birth through 1 year of age (11%) and adults greater than or equal to 31 years of age (10%). Female patients had a higher case-fatality rate (6%) than male patients (3%), although the difference was not significant (P greater than .05). Death was independently associated with seizures, intestinal perforation, pneumonia, and delirium or coma. These results indicated that the patients with typhoid fever who were at highest risk of complications and death were children from birth through 1 year of age and adults greater than or equal to 31 years of age. \nEffect of nitroglycerin on coronary collateral function during exercise evaluated by quantitative analysis of thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography. A noninfarcted, entirely collateral-dependent myocardial region provides an opportunity to assess the effect of nitroglycerin on coronary collateral function during exercise. Stress thallium-201 computed tomography was performed in seven patients with effort angina and no history of myocardial infarction, both before and after nitroglycerin (0.3 mg). All patients had single-vessel disease with total or subtotal (99% with delay) occlusion of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and well-developed collaterals. The pressure-rate product, mean blood pressure, and heart rate at peak exercise did not differ before and after nitroglycerin. The size of the perfusion defect and the severity of ischemia during exercise estimated by quantitative analysis of thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography were significantly less after nitroglycerin administration (extent score: 23 +/- 17 vs 7 +/- 9, p less than 0.01; severity score: 20 +/- 22 vs 3 +/- 4, p less than 0.05). The pressure-rate products at peak exercise did not differ before and after nitroglycerin, which suggested that the reduction in perfusion defect size was unlikely to be the result of decreased myocardial oxygen consumption. These results suggest that nitroglycerin improved coronary collateral function during exercise and thus prevented exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. \nBenign positional vertigo: incidence and prognosis in a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota. A retrospective review of our population-based medical records linkage system for residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, revealed 53 patients (34 women and 19 men; mean age, 51 years) with newly diagnosed benign positional vertigo in 1984. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence was 64 per 100,000 population per year (95% confidence interval, 46 to 81 per 100,000). The incidence of benign positional vertigo increased by 38% with each decade of life (95% confidence interval, 23 to 54%). One patient had an initial stroke during follow-up; thus, the relative risk for new stroke associated with benign positional vertigo was 1.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 8.98) in comparison with the expected occurrence based on incidence rates for an age- and sex-adjusted control population. The observed survival among the 53 Olmsted County residents with benign positional vertigo diagnosed in 1984 was not significantly different from that of an age- and sex-matched general population. Patients with benign positional vertigo seem to have a good prognosis. \nValue of regional wall motion abnormality in the emergency room diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. A prospective study using two-dimensional echocardiography. Because regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) is usually noted during ischemia, we hypothesized that the presence of this finding with two-dimensional echocardiography would be superior to conventional methods of diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the emergency room. We also hypothesized that because the absence of RWMA would probably not be associated with AMI, the use of two-dimensional echocardiography would significantly limit unnecessary hospital admissions. To test these hypotheses, we undertook a prospective study that used two-dimensional echocardiography in 180 patients presenting to the emergency room with symptoms suggestive of AMI. The emergency room physicians were not informed of the two-dimensional echocardiography findings, and their decision to admit or not admit to the hospital was based on conventional clinical and electrocardiographic criteria. Forty patients were not admitted to the hospital and 140 were admitted. Of the 30 patients with enzyme-confirmed AMI, nine had typical ST elevation on the ECG that was consistent with acute injury, three had normal ECGs, and eight had ECGs in the presence of which AMI could not have been diagnosed (left bundle branch block, paced rhythm, or repolarization changes); the rest had nonspecific ECG findings. Of the 29 AMI patients with technically adequate two-dimensional echocardiography studies, two did not demonstrate RWMA and 27 had RWMA, compared with nine with diagnostic ECG changes (p less than 0.001). Of the 13 patients with in-hospital complications only four had an initial ECG showing ST elevation, and all 13 had RWMA (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nAutoimmunity after alpha-interferon therapy for malignant carcinoid tumors. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of autoantibodies and autoimmune disease and their influence on therapeutic results during alpha-interferon treatment in patients with malignant midgut carcinoid tumors. DESIGN: Consecutive sample of patients. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-five patients (70 women, 65 men; median age, 59 years) with biopsy-proven tumors, liver metastases, and no autoimmune disease. INTERVENTIONS: Leukocyte alpha-interferon (n = 88) or alpha-interferon 2b (n = 47) three times a week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Signs and symptoms of autoimmune disease or development of autoantibodies to thyroid antigens, nuclear antigens, or gastric parietal cells. Tumor responses were determined by reduced liver metastases or reduced urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid excretion, or both. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (19%) developed the following autoimmune disorders after a median of 9 months of therapy: thyroid disease (n = 18), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1), pernicious anemia (n = 4), and vasculitis (n = 2). Antibodies to microsomal thyroid antigen or thyroglobulin were detected in 16 patients before therapy and in another 11 patients during therapy. Antinuclear antibodies were detected in 16 patients before and in another 19 patients during therapy. Clinical thyroid disease developed in more than 60% of patients who had or developed thyroid antibodies but in only 7% of initially autoantibody-negative patients. Autoimmunity did not correlate with objective tumor response. CONCLUSION: Patients with malignant carcinoid tumors may develop autoimmune disease during alpha-interferon therapy, especially when autoantibodies are present. They should therefore be monitored for autoimmunity, which does not appear, however, to influence tumor responses. \nChylous ascites and lymphocyst management by peritoneovenous shunt. Although lymphocyst (retroperitoneal lymphocele) is not an uncommon complication after retroperitoneal surgery, with a reported incidence ranging from 0.6% to 48%, the occurrence of chylous ascites is a rare phenomenon. Most reports are anecdotal, and hospital records list the incidence of diagnosis as 0.001% of admissions. Diagnosis of chylous ascites is usually not difficult, inasmuch as aspiration and chemical analysis of the fluid yield the answer. Visualization of retroperitoneal fluid collection by computerized tomography or ultrasonography, however, does always raise the possibility of recurrence of tumor in cases where the primary operation was for cancer. Treatment of smaller lesions can be expectant. Respiratory exercises causing an increase in negative intrathoracic pressure may aid in the movement of fluid through the lymphatics. For larger collections, elemental diets and total parenteral nutrition are also often enough, but surgery is sometimes required. Simple insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt, as in this patient, can be as effective as major operations such as identification and ligation of the offending lymphatic or marsupialization of the cyst. \nSubarachnoid hemorrhage in sickle-cell disease. The neurological complications of sickle-cell disease include cerebral intracerebral hemorrhage; subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been infrequently reported. Among 325 patients with sickle-cell disease followed at the University of Illinois between 1975 and 1989, 11 cases of SAH were identified. Aneurysms were found in 10 of these patients, three of whom had multiple aneurysms. All of the patients had some degree of anemia and nine underwent craniotomy without hematological or neurological complications. From this review it appears that SAH is not uncommon in sickle-cell disease patients and tends to occur at a younger age and with smaller aneurysm size than in the general population. With proper perioperative management, including exchange transfusions to reduce the proportion of hemoglobin S to less than 30%, these patients can undergo angiography and craniotomy without an increased incidence of complications. The techniques used in managing sickle-cell disease patients with SAH are discussed. \nDeterminants of perinatal outcome in pregnancy-induced hypertension with absence of umbilical artery end-diastolic frequencies. Forty-three pregnancies that were complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension and either absence of umbilical artery end-diastolic frequencies (n = 32) or reversal of umbilical artery end-diastolic frequencies (n = 11) were reviewed. The incidence of perinatal mortality and morbidity was similar for the two Doppler patterns. Perinatal survival was highly dependent on the gestational age when hypertension first appeared. Presentation at greater than or equal to 30 weeks' gestation was associated with a perinatal survival rate of 86%. Presentation at less than 30 weeks' gestation was associated with a perinatal survival rate of 38% (p less than 0.005). Pregnancy-induced hypertension that presented before 30 weeks was more often associated with a 5-minute Apgar score less than 7 (p less than 0.005) and a nonreactive nonstress test (p less than 0.05) compared with pregnancy-induced hypertension that presented at or beyond 30 weeks. For pregnancies that presented before 30 weeks, the only difference between perinatal survivors (n = 11) and perinatal deaths (n = 18) was a higher incidence of birth weight at or below the 10th percentile among deaths (p = 0.02). \nComparison of ondansetron and ondansetron plus dexamethasone as antiemetic prophylaxis during cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Ondansetron, a serotonin antagonist, is effective in controlling the emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy; however, emesis in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin is poorly controlled by ondansetron alone. Dexamethasone is an effective antiemetic with no known interaction with serotonin receptors and was thus chosen for study in combination with ondansetron. 31 patients (30 male, 1 female; median age 28.5 years, range 18-49) receiving a 4-day course of a chemotherapy regimen containing cisplatin (100-120 mg/m2) for metastatic germ-cell tumours were entered in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial comparing oral ondansetron plus placebo with oral ondansetron plus dexamethasone as antiemetic prophylaxis. Ondansetron (8 mg every 8 h) was given to all patients for 8 days from the start of chemotherapy. Patients were given 8 mg of dexamethasone or placebo every 8 h starting 2 h before cisplatin (on day 4) and continuing for six doses (ie, for 2 days only). A second course of chemotherapy began 14 days after the start of the first, during which patients crossed over to the alternative antiemetic regimen. Results were available from 27 patients. In the 24-48 h after cisplatin 78% of patients taking ondansetron plus dexamethasone reported complete or major control of emesis compared with 30% of those taking ondansetron plus placebo (p = 0.001). Cross-over analysis showed a significant advantage for ondansetron plus dexamethasone in the control of nausea (p = 0.013) and emesis (p less than 0.001) over the 8-day study. 24 of 26 patients expressed a preference for the combination therapy (p less than 0.001). Ondansetron plus dexamethasone is effective antiemetic prophylaxis for high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy, has few side effects, and is active when given orally. \nGonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide acetate) induced ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in a woman undergoing intermittent hemodialysis. Moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurred after LA was administered to control menorrhagia in an anephric woman who required hemodialysis. We postulate that women who require dialysis may be at special risk for the development of this syndrome. \nIntrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in hepatolithiasis: A frequently overlooked disease. Five cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were found among 101 cases of hepatolithiasis. There was no definite sign of cholangiocarcinoma in ERCP and image studies of four cases. The possibility of the existence of occult cholangiocarcinoma should be kept in mind, especially when unusual presentations, such as body weight loss, anemia, palpable abdominal mass, and intractable pain, appear. An intraoperative frozen-section examination should be considered under the following circumstances: (1) whitish nodular mass over liver, (2) mucinous substance within bile duct, and (3) enlarged, firm lymph nodes clustered along the hepatic arteries and/or celiac arteries. \nEffect of theophylline and dipyridamole on the respiratory response to isocapnic hypoxia in normal human subjects. 1. Twelve healthy young men took part in this investigation of the effect of oral theophylline and dipyridamole (two drugs known to affect the pharmacological effects of the purine nucleoside adenosine) on the respiratory response to isocapnic hypoxia. 2. The subjects underwent hypoxic rebreathing manoeuvres after 3-day pretreatments with each of the drugs for 12 h and were at least 2 h postprandial. For each in-Minute ventilation, the maximum rate of isometric inspiratory pressure development at the mouth and the ratio of inspiratory duration to total breath duration were analysed breath-by-breath and regressions of these variables upon the haemoglobin oxygen saturation were performed. 3. The slopes and intercepts of the lines describing the relationships of minute ventilation and the maximum rate of isometric inspiratory pressure development at the mouth with haemoglobin oxygen saturation were unaffected by the study drugs, and no differences in the pattern of breathing were observed. 4. We conclude that oral administration of these drugs does not result in alteration of the response of the respiratory system to progressive isocapnic hypoxia. 5. This suggests that either adenosine has no physiological role in hypoxic respiratory control as measured, or that it has opposing peripheral chemoreceptor and central respiratory centre effects which could not be distinguished by the techniques used. \nAn autopsy study of the peritoneal cavity from patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Sixteen autopsies were performed on patients aged 56 +/- 15 (SD) years who were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 834 +/- 766 (SD) days. Lactate-buffered dialysate and povidone-iodine antiseptic were used in all cases. Multiple peritoneal sections were taken to evaluate peritoneal membrane thickening, inflammation, neovascularization, fibrosis, and adhesions. Peritoneal thickening, inflammation, or adhesions were not related to sex, race, or etiology of renal failure. Time on dialysis was also not a direct determinant of peritoneal adhesions or neovascularization. Peritonitis episodes correlated with chronic peritoneal serosal changes. This study supports the hypothesis that peritoneal alterations in patients on CAPD are related to episodes of peritonitis. \nPneumocephalus associated with benign brain tumor: report of two cases. Two cases of spontaneous pneumocephalus, which developed after ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedures for severe hydrocephalus caused by benign brain tumors, are reported. In both cases there was no previous history of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Operation revealed that both patients had many small defects of the dura mater and the bone in the middle cranial fossa, which were plugged by necrotic brain tissue. These defects were remote from the sites of the original tumors but may have been produced by long-standing raised intracranial pressure, and they presumably allowed air to enter after intracranial pressure was reduced by shunting. Repair of the defects prevented further intracranial air retention. \nCardiovascular and metabolic characteristics of hypertension. Hypertension is now seen as a broader condition than high blood pressure alone. Large-scale epidemiologic studies have established that high blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy have shown an inconsistent reduction in major cardiovascular endpoints. Importantly, the incidence of coronary disease has been reduced to only a small e",
