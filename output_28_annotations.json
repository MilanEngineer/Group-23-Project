        "text": "relates of the original signal. When reinforcement is added to the behavioral procedures, the infant or young child provides highly reliable responses, and it is possible to test most infants 6 months of age and older with these procedures. The combination of both behavioral and electrophysiologic procedures can resolve most clinical questions regarding the auditory function of young infants and children. \nOral acyclovir therapy of recurrent herpes simplex virus type 2 infection of the hand. Acyclovir was evaluated as treatment of recurrent herpes simplex virus type 2 infection of the hand in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. In nine fully evaluable patients, oral acyclovir (2 g/day in three doses for 10 days) initiated during the earliest phase of a recurrence reduced the mean durations (+/- standard deviation) of clinical symptoms from 10.1 (+/- 3.6) to 3.7 (+/- 3.0) days (P = 0.008), signs from 11.1 (+/- 3.7) to 6.2 (+/- 3.3) days (P = 0.024), and viral positivity from 5.3 (+/- 3.8) to 0.6 (+/- 1.1) days (P = 0.011). \nPatient-controlled analgesia. Does a concurrent opioid infusion improve pain management after surgery? OBJECTIVE.--To assess the influence of a continuous (basal) morphine infusion as part of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) system on the postoperative analgesic requirement and on recovery parameters following abdominal hysterectomy. DESIGN.--Single-center, randomized, controlled protocol. SETTING.--University medical center. PARTICIPANTS.--A total of 230 adult women were randomly assigned to receive no morphine infusion (control group) or a continuous 0.5-, 1.0-, or 2.0-mg/h morphine infusion. Each patient was able to self-administer supplemental intravenous bolus doses of morphine (1 to 2 mg) using a PCA infuser. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Use of the PCA device, opioid-related side effects, recovery times, and the patients' assessment of pain and sedation on linear visual analog scales were recorded during the 72-hour study period. Follow-up questionnaires were completed by the patients and their health care professionals to assess the overall adequacy of PCA therapy. RESULTS.--Patients who received the 2-mg/h morphine infusions received significantly more opioid medication 9 to 72 hours after their operation than those who received no infusion (control group). The presence of a continuous morphine infusion of 0.5 to 2 mg/h did not significantly decrease the number of patient demands or supplemental bolus doses administered compared with the control group. Overall, 168 (84%) of the 199 patients who completed the 72-hour study were able to achieve adequate analgesia without requiring changes in the PCA regimen or experiencing major side effects. Recovery times and outcome variables were similar in all four groups. CONCLUSION.--The routine use of a continuous opioid infusion in combination with a standard PCA regimen does not improve pain management compared with PCA alone after abdominal hysterectomy. \nLeukaemia mortality among relatives of cystic fibrosis patients. A total of 219 families of patients with cystic fibrosis living in Wales were studied for the occurrence of other diseases and for cause of death, and the findings in relation to leukaemia are reported. There were eight deaths due to leukaemia, five of the myeloid type, in first and second degree relatives; this is significantly more than the expected on the basis of national age specific mortality rates. In comparison, mortality among siblings, parents, aunts and uncles, and grandparents from all causes was within the expected. Screening the five patients with myeloid leukaemia for the delta F508 mutation showed that four were carriers of this mutation. It is concluded that carriers of the delta F508 mutation may have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia. This could happen through the direct effect of the cystic fibrosis gene itself, or through its influence on another gene, such as the met oncogene, or gene(s) involved in granulocyte function on the long arm of chromosome 7. \nSubclinical cardiac dysfunction in sarcoidosis. Clinically apparent myocardial disease is infrequent in sarcoidosis. However, autopsy data show myocardial involvement in up to 30 percent of patients. Unexplained exertional symptomatology is a common complaint in patients with sarcoidosis. In this study, we investigated whether abnormal cardiac function might limit exercise performance in patients with sarcoidosis without overt cardiac involvement. We studied exercise responses in 35 patients with sarcoidosis and compared them with 28 untrained controls. Seventy-seven percent of the patients were symptomatic. Pulmonary function test results were lower in the group with sarcoidosis than normal controls, but they were within normal range. Only one patient had evidence of ventilatory limitation to exercise. Sixteen (46 percent) patients had abnormally increased heart rates (HRs) at rest prior to exercise testing and/or with exercise. Rapid HRs were confirmed during daily activities by continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured to determine if systolic dysfunction could account for abnormal HR responses. Of patients with abnormally increased HRs, five had LVEFs less than 50 percent, and eight had normal LVEFs, of whom 75 percent had tachycardia at rest. Retrospective comparison of HR responses and LVEF between patients who did or did not receive corticosteroids revealed no significant differences between groups. We conclude that abnormal HR responses in patients without evident cardiac sarcoidosis are common and exertional symptoms in this population are often associated with chronotropic abnormalities. The exact mechanisms underlying the chronotropic abnormalities are unclear, but they likely include ventricular systolic dysfunction, sinus node dysfunction from granulomatous infiltration, or combinations of the two. \nEffect of massive dose vitamin A on morbidity and mortality in Indian children The effect of vitamin A supplementation on preschool child morbidity and mortality was assessed in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study around Hyderabad, India. Every six months 200,000 IU vitamin A was given to 7691 children (treatment group) whereas 8084 children received a placebo (control group). Morbidity and mortality data were collected every three months. Risk of respiratory infection was higher in children with mild xerophthalmia than in children with normal eyes. Vitamin A supplementation had no effect on morbidity status. Mortality rates were similar in the two groups; it was highest in children who did not receive either vitamin A or placebo. The findings suggest that vitamin A supplementation alone may not reduce child mortality. \nOrigin of malignant centrofacial granulomas: surface markers and gene rearrangement of malignant cells. Malignant centrofacial granuloma (MCFG) is a clinical entity characterized by a relentless ulceration of the upper airway involving the nose, palate, and face, without any demonstrable etiology. The origin of 11 cases were analyzed with the help of cell-surface immunostaining in all and with T-cell receptor gene (TCR) rearrangement in 3. The results show that most of the cases of MCFG are in fact T-cell lymphomas with cell-surface antigens (CD2, CD7, CD3) consistent with either early or mature T lymphocytes. However, some cases exhibit B-lymphoid (CD19, CD20) or histiomonocytic (CD13, CD14) lineage-specific markers. In conclusion, despite its remarkable clinical unity, MCFG is a heterogeneous group of neoplastic diseases, most but not all of which may be classified as T-cell lymphoma. \nPopliteal aneurysm with spontaneous arteriovenous fistula. This report documents a rare manifestation of aneurysmal disease of the popliteal artery. We describe a popliteal aneurysm presenting with acute venous hypertension due to a spontaneously occurring arteriovenous fistula. The fistula was defunctionalized by treating the aneurysm with a standard technique of exclusion and bypass with resolution of the symptoms of venous hypertension and maintenance of normal distal perfusion. \nExtraocular muscle surgery in myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is typically a disease of young people in active employment who need a field of binocular single vision. Although it is systemically controllable with a good chance of spontaneous remission, persistent loss of binocularity may cause chronic disability. We report our experience of extraocular muscle surgery in five patients with stable myasthenia gravis and persistent double vision. Extraocular muscle involvement was selective, giving rise to incomitant and concomitant squints, with individual muscle overactions as well as underactions. Treatment was by conventional recession and resection procedures with the additional use of Faden and adjustable sutures where appropriate. In all five cases a larger, stable field of binocular single vision was established. It is concluded that extraocular muscle surgery may be beneficial in selected cases of myasthenia gravis. \nA comparison of sucralfate with placebo in the treatment of esophageal ulcers following therapeutic endoscopic sclerotherapy of esophageal varices--a prospective controlled randomized trial. In 1984 Roark published the first report of a sucralfate treatment of esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy. Because this was an uncontrolled trial we planned a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study with 60 patients. After therapeutic paravariceal injection-sclerotherapy of esophageal varices, patients were randomly treated with sucralfate suspension or placebo. Time of treatment was limited to a maximum of 3 weeks and the dosage of sucralfate was 1 g q.i.d. (Ulcogant-Suspension). Healing was assessed by endoscopy at weekly intervals. Fifty-three patients (25 sucralfate, 28 placebo) were evaluable according to the protocol. No patient left the study because of side effects. At the start of the trial, the patients in the sucralfate group showed a larger ulcer area than the placebo group. There was a tendency to faster healing in the sucralfate group, especially in patients with deeper ulcerations. However, there was no significant difference in global healing between both treatment groups after 3 weeks. Sucralfate suspension may be of value in accelerating the healing process in esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy, especially in patients with deep ulcers. These results should be confirmed in further trials, in which patients should be stratified with respect to their ulcer volume and severity of liver disease. \nOrthostatic vital signs in emergency department patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the variability and define the normal ranges of orthostatic vital signs in an emergency department population. DESIGN: Descriptive. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Adult ED patients with no history of recent blood or fluid losses. MEASUREMENTS: Lying and standing heart rate and blood pressure measured by an automated instrument. RESULTS: In 132 presumed euvolemic patients, the statistical normal ranges (mean +/- 2 SD) of orthostatic vital signs were wide: on standing, the heart rate range was from decreases 5.0 to increases 39.4 beats per minute; for systolic blood pressure, the range was decreases 20 to increases 25.7 mm Hg; and for diastolic blood pressure, the range was decreases 6.4 to increases 24.9 mm Hg. In this sample, 43% had \"positive\" orthostatic vital signs according to currently accepted values. CONCLUSION: The data from this study indicate that there is a wider than expected variation in orthostatic vital signs among presumed euvolemic ED patients. \nPrognosis of symptomatic duodenal adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis. The frequent association between familial adenomatous polyposis and duodenal tumors is increasingly recognized, yet many patients do not benefit from adequate diagnosis and follow-up of upper gastrointestinal polyps. A retrospective review of 14 patients with duodenal tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis was undertaken to assess the impact of early diagnosis by screening asymptomatic patients. Six of eight patients presenting with symptoms suggesting duodenal disease had invasive cancer. Four of these six patients died after surviving a mean of 13 months after diagnosis. In contrast, none of the six patients diagnosed after screening with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has had invasive carcinoma. Early diagnosis and long-term surveillance of asymptomatic patients with familial adenomatous polyposis affords the opportunity to diagnose and treat duodenal tumors at an early stage, thereby, avoiding the dismal prognosis once invasive cancer has developed. \nTriiodothyronine-enhanced left ventricular function after ischemic injury. Hypothyroidism is associated with profound left ventricular dysfunction. Brain-dead organ donors and patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass are chemically hypothyroid with significantly reduced circulating free triiodothyronine (T3). To test the hypothesis that T3 enhances left ventricular function in a hormonally deficient environment, a total of 36 healthy New Zealand White rabbit hearts were studied using a modified Langendorff preparation with Krebs-Henseleit perfusate and intra-ventricular balloon. In 9 normal rabbit hearts a cumulative dose-response curve with logarithmically increasing doses of T3 was obtained. The vehicle solution for T3 dissolution served as control (n = 9). Left ventricular function was assessed from peak developed pressure at baseline and after T3 administration. Triiodothyronine had no effect in normal hearts on peak developed pressure or end-diastolic pressure. In 18 rabbits, the acute effect of T3 administration after ischemia was investigated. Preischemic left ventricular function was measured to serve as baseline, and hearts were subjected to 37 degrees C global ischemia. Triiodothyronine (n = 9) or vehicle (n = 9) was infused during reperfusion, and left ventricular peak developed pressure was measured at 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion. Recovery of function (expressed as percent return of left ventricular peak developed pressure) was significantly improved within 15 minutes of reperfusion (65.0% +/- 2.1% versus 80.2% +/- 4.1%) and remained significantly improved throughout the reperfusion period (p less than 0.05 by analysis of variance). These data suggest that although T3 possesses no inotropic properties, it significantly improves postischemic left ventricular function. The rapidity of the functional improvement suggests that these effects may be due to plasma membrane-mediated mechanisms. \nBrain protection during circulatory arrest. Previous nuclear magnetic resonance studies in this laboratory have shown a beneficial biochemical effect of antegrade cerebroplegia (CP-A) during hypothermic circulatory arrest. This study compared CP-A with other methods of cerebral protection during hypothermic circulatory arrest to assess the clinical utility of this technique. Twenty-three sheep were divided into four groups: systemic hypothermia alone (SYST) and systemic hypothermia combined with external cranial cooling (EXTNL), retrograde cerebroplegia (CP-R), or CP-A. Cardiopulmonary bypass was started, and the sheep were cooled to 15 degrees C and subjected to 2 hours of circulatory arrest. Cardiopulmonary bypass was restarted, and the animals were rewarmed and weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Serial neurological examinations were performed and hourly scores assigned until the animals were extubated. Postanesthetic neurological scores improved in all groups throughout the 6-hour recovery period except the CP-R group. The improvement over time for these scores was similar for the EXTNL and CP-A groups and significantly better than for the SYST or CP-R groups (p = 0.004). The CP-A group had 5 of 7 animals with deficit-free survival despite the similarity in recovery of baseline brainstem function. We conclude that both antegrade infusion of cerebroplegia and external cranial cooling confer distinct cerebroprotective effects after a protracted period of hypothermic circulatory arrest when compared with the other methods studied. \nDiagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cystatin C in cerebrospinal fluid. An abnormally low level of cystatin C in the cerebrospinal fluid is a diagnostic marker for the hereditary form of brain hemorrhage associated with amyloidosis that was first identified in Iceland. We developed an assay for cystatin C to use in the diagnosis of patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and brain hemorrhage. This test consists of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal mouse anticystatin C and polyclonal rabbit anticystatin C antibodies. The cystatin C level was assayed in cerebrospinal fluid samples from 29 patients with brain hemorrhage and 45 control patients with other neurological diseases. Fifteen patients with brain hemorrhage showed low cystatin C levels (less than or equal to 70 ng/ml) in a clinical setting in which the positive and negative findings were compatible with a diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Immunohistological examination of brain tissue obtained by biopsy from two of the 15 patients confirmed the diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and identified the deposition of cystatin C and beta-protein. This enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is simple to perform and may be useful for investigating patients suspected of having cerebral amyloid angiopathy with brain hemorrhage and the deposition of cystatin C. \nPain on intradermal injection with lignocaine. The effect of concentration. Twenty ASA 1 volunteers were each injected intradermally with four solutions containing 0.2 ml of 0.5%, 1%, and 2% lignocaine and 0.9% saline to determine whether the pain experienced on injection was related to the concentration of local anaesthetic. A 10 cm linear analogue pain scoring system was used, and the solutions were ranked from most painful to least painful. There were no differences between the different concentrations of lignocaine and 0.9% saline in the severity of pain experienced. We conclude that any concentration of lignocaine may be used intradermally before inserting intravenous catheters without affecting the degree of pain experienced by that injection. \nDissociation of second messenger activation by parathyroid hormone fragments in osteosarcoma cells. PTH activates multiple second messengers in its target cells, but the level at which the hormonal signal splits into different pathways is still unknown. To achieve insights on this issue, we have studied the structure-function relationship of PTH by analyzing the effects of bovine PTH-(1-34) [bPTH-(1-34)] and PTH fragments truncated at the N-terminus on the intracellular calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) and cAMP production in the rat osteogenic sarcoma cell line UMR 106-01. [Ca2+]i was measured in single cells using fura-2. When exposed to 10(-7) M bPTH-(1-34), 20% of the cells responded with a transient increase in [Ca2+]i of variable amplitude. Equimolar doses of bPTH-(2-34), propionyl bPTH-(2-34) [(pbPTH-(2-34)], and bPTH-(3-34) also transiently increased [Ca2+]i, whereas both [tyrosine34]bPTH-(7-34) amide [bPTH-(7-34)] and bPTH-(30-34) were ineffective. The amplitude of the [Ca2+] i transients was dose-dependent, with threshold concentrations of 10(-10) M for bPTH-(1-34) and bPTH-(2-34), and 10(-9) M for bPTH-(3-34). The response rate to the active peptides ranged between 10-30%, without a clear dose-relatedness. A second addition of 10(-7) M bPTH-(1-34) to cells prestimulated with equimolar doses of bPTH-(2-34), pbPTH-(2-34), or bPTH-(3-34) produced another transient, whereas after exposure to 10(-7) M bPTH-(1-34), the cells were completely desensitized to a second homologous stimulation, suggesting that the binding affinity of the truncated peptides for the PTH receptor is lower than that of the intact bPTH-(1-34) fragment. In addition, both bPTH-(1-34) and bPTH-(2-34) dose-dependently stimulated cAMP production, but the former was more potent (ED50 = 10(-9) vs. 10(-7) M, respectively). On the contrary, pbPTH-(2-34), bPTH-(3-34), and bPTH-(7-34) had no effect on cAMP. Pretreating the cells with pertussis toxin to enhance cAMP responses via inhibition of Gi potentiated the effect of bPTH-(1-34) and bPTH-(2-34) and disclosed weak but detectable agonist action of pbPTH-(2-34). These results indicate that specific domains of the PTH molecule are linked to activation of different second messenger pathways; while the first two amino acids are indispensable for activating the cAMP system, generation of the [Ca2+]i signal appears to involve a longer domain, including the amino acid residue in position 3. \nMolecular evaluation of response to all-trans-retinoic acid therapy in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The advent of retinoic acid (RA) in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has led to a high frequency of short-lasting complete remissions (CR). We studied the response to RA by molecularly analyzing the RA receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus, which has recently been shown to be rearranged in all APLs. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the RAR alpha rearrangements persisted in the APL samples containing maturing myeloid cells 2 to 3 weeks after the start of RA treatment, but disappeared after 5 to 8 weeks, when the patients achieved CR. Our investigations provide clear evidence that CR occurs at molecular level and that there is reconstitution of an apparently normal, nonclonal hematopoiesis. Further, it shows that RA acts by triggering differentiation rather than by exerting a cytotoxic effect on the leukemic clone. \nThe role of intraluminal radiotherapy and concurrent 5-fluorouracil infusion in the management of carcinoma esophagus: a pilot study. Fifty patients with carcinoma of the esophagus were entered in a randomized pilot study to test the efficacy of intraluminal radiotherapy (ILRT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion. The median age was 65 years, with 80% having middle third lesions; in 62%, the lesions were longer than 5 cm. After external beam therapy of 50 Gy in 5 weeks, patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy. Significant improvement in dysphagia was recorded in 76% patients with complete response in 47 cases ranging from 6 to 27 months. The overall survival at 2 years was 15% with ILRT alone versus 22% with ILRT plus 5-FU infusion. \nFrom tissue angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition to antihypertensive effect. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has long been regarded as a classical hormonal system, with angiotensin II (ANG II) being the circulating effector peptide. In recent years, evidence for additional RAS in various organs, including vascular wall, kidney, adrenal gland, heart, and brain, has been obtained. Drugs interfering with the RAS such as the converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors may, therefore, not only inhibit the plasma RAS but also inhibit these tissue RAS. Such a \"tissue\" RAS inhibition has been repeatedly demonstrated in animal experiments, and in some cases it correlated better with the cardiovascular actions of the CE inhibitors than did inhibition of plasma RAS. In the vascular wall, a local inhibition of ANG II synthesis may contribute not only to the reduction of vascular tone but also to the marked regression of media hypertrophy seen after CE inhibitor treatment. Vascular ANG II generation by CE appears to occur almost exclusively at the luminal surface of the endothelium. Locally formed ANG II may then contribute to the pool of circulating ANG II (endocrine ANG II) or feed back to adjacent cells without being transported by the blood (paracrine ANG II). Thus, CE inhibitors may not have to penetrate into deeper layers of the vascular wall to inhibit the vascular RAS, but may rather prevent the paracrine actions of locally generated ANG II. \nEffect of clean intermittent catheterisation on radiological appearance of the upper urinary tract in children with myelomeningocele. Of the 102 consecutive children with myelomeningocele who were treated by intermittent catheterisation between 1977 and 1985, 89 were investigated with regard to the development of the upper urinary tract. The median follow-up period was 6.7 years. Dilatation and vesicoureteric reflux were assessed by means of repeated urography and voiding cystourethrography. Of the 49 children with normal radiology at the start of catheterisation, all but 2 remained normal. In 27 with isolated dilatation of the upper urinary tract or reflux at the start, 17 subsequently became normal. Dilatation together with reflux was seen in 13 patients at the start; 3 became normal, 4 still had reflux and in 6 patients both dilatation and reflux persisted. Intermittent catheterisation thus had a positive effect on the upper urinary tract in the vast majority of cases. In children with both dilatation and reflux, however, there is a risk of deterioration and they should be followed up closely. \nHelicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcer. Most patients with chronic duodenal ulcer (DU) craters have gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori (HP), now thought to be the major cause of DU. A smaller proportion of DU patients have no detectable HP. In this study, we examined the frequency and causes of HP-negative duodenal ulcers. In 302 consecutive patients with endoscopic diagnosis of duodenal ulcer, 284 (94%) were found to have associated HP gastritis, whereas 18 (6%) were HP-negative on histology, culture, and urease test. The largest subgroup of HP-negative patients (8/18) was made up of those who had been taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), followed closely (4/18) by patients with recent intake of antibiotics. Causes of DU in the remaining subgroups included two patients with duodenal Crohn's disease, two with Gastrospirillum hominis infection, one with penetrating carcinoma of the pancreas and one with no detectable cause. We conclude that, although the most common causal factor of duodenal ulcer is HP, some 6% of DU's will be HP-negative, signaling unusual etiology. It is now important to identify the cause of duodenal ulcer so as to initiate appropriate therapy. \nEpitope map of neurofilament protein domains in cortical and peripheral nervous system Lewy bodies. A subset of demented elderly patients exhibit large numbers of cortical intraneuronal inclusions similar to the neurofilament (NF)-rich Lewy bodies (LB) found in pigmented subcortical neurons of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Because these cortical inclusions may contribute to the emergence of cognitive impairments in afflicted individuals, the authors mapped the distribution of NF epitopes in these so-called cortical LBs. This was done using ethanol-fixed tissues and a large library of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with well-characterized binding specificities to various regions of each NF triplet protein. Cortical LBs were examined by light, confocal, and electron microscopy, and they were compared with the subcortical LBs of PD and LBs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Monoclonal antibodies specific for the rod regions of each of the three NF subunits, or for phosphate-dependent and independent antigenic sites in the tail region of the high- (NF-H) and middle- (NF-M) molecular weight (Mr) NF subunits as well as other MAbs to the extreme COOH terminus of NF-L and NF-M or the head region of NF-M labeled a variable number of cortical LBs. Remarkably one of these anti-NF MAbs, RMO32, which recognized a phosphorylated epitope in the tail region of NF-M, immunolabeled nearly all cortical LBs, whereas each of the other anti-NF MAbs never labeled more than 10% of ubiquitin- or RMO32-positive cortical LBs. Further LBs in the PNS resembled those in the central nervous system (CNS) in their immunologic properties, and LBs in both sites were dominated by filamentous aggregates at the ultrastructural level. These findings suggest that NF proteins are profoundly altered during their incorporation into cortical and PNS LBs. Further the authors here identified immunologic and ultrastructural properties common to cortical LBs, PNS LBs, and classic substantia nigra LBs in PD. The accumulation of filamentous, perikaryal inclusions rich in NF proteins at diverse sites in the CNS and PNS of patients with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders suggests a widespread disruption of NF metabolism or transport. \nNeurosarcoidosis--demonstration of meningeal disease by gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Arriving at a firm diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis continues to pose serious problems, particularly when evidence of granulomatous disease outside the nervous system is lacking. The commonest mode of presentation of neurosarcoidosis is with cranial nerve palsies. Two cases of presumed neurosarcoidosis with cranial nerve palsies showed clear evidence of focal meningeal disease on gadolinium-DTPA enhanced MRI brain scans. Although not specific for sarcoidosis, this technique may be very useful in aiding the diagnosis in suspected cases. \nInterrelationship between histopathologic characteristics of melanoma and estrogen receptor status. To evaluate whether the increase in disease-free survival and survival previously reported for women with melanomas with estrogen receptors (ER) was a reflection of the histopathology of the primary melanoma, the interrelationship of histopathologic characteristics of 143 patients with such tumors was examined. The ER was assayed in the primary tumor from 44 patients and in 99 metastatic deposits from the other patients. Tumor thickness, level of invasion, prognostic index, mitoses/mm2, ulceration, vascular invasion, necrosis, histologic grade, preexisting nevus, and predominant malignant cell type were examined. There was no relationship between ER presence and any histopathologic characteristic examined, irrespective of the tumor source (primary or metastatic). Examination of histopathologic characteristics as a function of sex and receptor status showed a slight but insignificant predominance of more well-differentiated, thinner tumors in women whose lesions were positive for the ER. These results suggest that the increased disease-free survival in patients with ER-positive lesions is not attributable to the pathologic characteristics of the primary tumor examined during this study. \nBenign positional vertigo: incidence and prognosis in a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota. A retrospective review of our population-based medical records linkage system for residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, revealed 53 patients (34 women and 19 men; mean age, 51 years) with newly diagnosed benign positional vertigo in 1984. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence was 64 per 100,000 population per year (95% confidence interval, 46 to 81 per 100,000). The incidence of benign positional vertigo increased by 38% with each decade of life (95% confidence interval, 23 to 54%). One patient had an initial stroke during follow-up; thus, the relative risk for new stroke associated with benign positional vertigo was 1.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 8.98) in comparison with the expected occurrence based on incidence rates for an age- and sex-adjusted control population. The observed survival among the 53 Olmsted County residents with benign positional vertigo diagnosed in 1984 was not significantly different from that of an age- and sex-matched general population. Patients with benign positional vertigo seem to have a good prognosis. \nUpdate: drug therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction is potentially a highly treatable disease. Immediate interventions are directed to decreasing tissue hypoxia with oxygen and improving bloodflow to ischemic myocardium using nitrates and thrombolytic agents. Cardiac workload should be reduced by eliminating endogenous catecholamine release with analgesia and sedation, and beta blockade in patients without CHF to decrease heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand. Treatment of the complications of AMI include dysrhythmia prophylaxis, monitoring and specific therapy. Treatment of pump failure includes using vasodilators, vasopressors and positive inotropic agents. Early recognition and timely initiation of appropriate therapy should be every physician's goal. \nOptic nerve sheath decompression for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy improves multiple visual function measurements. Optic nerve sheath decompression was performed in seven patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Visual function was evaluated by measurement of visual acuity with standardized Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts, color vision testing, quantitation of relative afferent pupillary defects with neutral-density filters, and Goldmann and Humphrey perimetry. Visual acuity improved markedly in all patients (at least doubling of the visual angle); the peripheral visual field expanded by at least 20 degrees (as measured by Goldmann perimetry) in six patients. Three patients also experienced marked improvement in color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, and foveal sensitivity. Our experience supports the possible beneficial effect of optic nerve sheath decompression in patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. \nOn the mechanisms of ventricular tachycardia acceleration during programmed electrical stimulation. BACKGROUND. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to acceleration of ventricular tachycardia (VT) are still unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS. High-resolution epicardial mapping was used to study the mechanisms of VT acceleration by programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in a model of sustained reentrant VT in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts (n = 40). Three different mechanisms responsible for acceleration of VT were identified: 1) induction of double-wave reentry (n = 6), defined as the occurrence of two successive activation waves circulating in the same direction in the same circuit; 2) change to a functionally determined circuit (n = 4), defined as reentry of the impulse around a functional line of block without involvement of a fixed obstacle; and 3) change of the reentrant circuit to reentry within a different, faster anatomic pathway (n = 3). Analysis of 81 episodes of sustained monomorphic VT induced by PES in 74 patients with clinically documented sustained VT in the setting of chronic coronary artery disease showed that in 22 episodes VT was suddenly accelerated by PES (mean cycle length, from 345 +/- 73 to 277 +/- 71 msec, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. With the observations made in the experimental model, the following tentative classification of the mechanisms of VT acceleration of the 22 episodes was made: 1) induction of double-wave reentry in two, 2) change to a functionally determined circuit in four, and 3) change to reentry within a faster anatomic circuit in 16. Simple criteria suggest that these mechanisms may apply in the clinical situation. \nOxygen transport measurements to evaluate tissue perfusion and titrate therapy: dobutamine and dopamine effects. BACKGROUND: Increased cardiac index, oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2) patterns were shown to characterize the physiologic status of surviving high-risk surgical patients, and indicate increased metabolic needs; relatively normal DO2 and VO2 values were found to characterize the sequential pattern of nonsurvivors who developed an early oxygen debt followed by lethal organ failure. The cardiac index, DO2, and VO2 values empirically determined from survivors' patterns were shown to improve outcome in prospective randomized trials. The present study considers these criteria to evaluate the tissue perfusion status as well as the effects of therapy on tissue perfusion and oxygenation. OBJECTIVE: To summarize new information on the temporal patterns of DO2, VO2, and oxygen debt on outcome and the effects of fluids and inotropes on these patterns in a wide range of clinical, temporal, and physiologic conditions. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis based on data gathered prospectively using a specified protocol. PATIENTS: High-risk patients with accidental or elective surgical trauma, and patients with or without sepsis or septic shock and organ failure. SETTING: University-run county hospital with a large trauma service. INTERVENTIONS: Fluids, dobutamine, and dopamine at various times and at various doses throughout critical illness of postoperative, posttraumatic, septic, and hypovolemic patients with and without lethal and nonlethal organ failure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pattern of DO2 plotted against the corresponding VO2 values in 437 consecutive critically ill surgical patients showed a wide variability and poor correlation probably because complex clinical conditions may obscure the supply-dependent and supply-independent VO2 relationships observed in normal dogs bled or given bacterial infusions. However, the use of specific therapy by well-defined protocols was shown to provide objective evidence of efficacy. Significant increases in DO2 and VO2 were previously shown after whole blood, packed red cells, and colloid administration, but not after crystalloid administration. Dobutamine administration in 715 circumstances in postoperative, traumatic, septic patients and patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and multiple organ failure significantly improved DO2 and VO2. Dopamine under comparable conditions produced less improvement in DO2 and VO2 than that of dobutamine; most of the VO2 changes were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The monitored patterns of cardiac index, DO2, and VO2 may be used to evaluate the adequacy of tissue perfusion as well as the relative effectiveness of alternative therapies. Second, these physiologic criteria may be used to titrate therapy in order to achieve optimal outcome. Third, after colloids optimally expand the plasma volume, dobutamine may be used to enhance flow and the distribution of flow in order to improve tissue oxygenation. Vasodilators may be used when hypertensive episodes occur or there is an inadequate response to inotropic agents. Vasopressors are used as a last resort, usually in the terminal or preterminal state. \nNew method for dealing with late-presenting spontaneous esophageal ruptures. A new technique is described for dealing with late-presenting spontaneous esophageal ruptures. This method requires only a short period of general anesthesia to drain the periesophageal abscess by a drainage tube inserted into the abscess cavity from the esophagus with the aid of a gastroscope and fluoroscopy. Gastric fluids are diverted from the esophageal rupture with a gastrostomy, and a jejunostomy is used for enteral feeding. The esophagus is retained, and closure of the fistula with resumption of normal swallowing is documented with serial sinograms. \nNutrition: its relationship to orthopedic infections. The malnutrition of orthopedic surgical patients plays an important role in the development of complications, including infection. A high index of suspicion that malnutrition exists or will soon exist in patients who are subjected to significant stress, trauma, or surgery will lead the clinician to take measures to avoid further protein calorie deficits and replenish the patient's nutritional needs. There are many pathways in which malnutrition causes a propensity for infection, and these have been discussed. Meeting the patient's nutritional needs should avoid some of the complications of infections in orthopedic surgery. \nTissue oxygenation in hemorrhagic shock measured as transcutaneous oxygen tension, subcutaneous oxygen tension, and gastrointestinal intramucosal pH in pigs BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Tissue oxygenation, measured in peripheral tissue as transcutaneous PO2 (PtCO2) and subcutaneous PO2, was compared with the oxygenation in GI mucosa, which was measured as intramucosal wall pH (pHi), during experimental hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation in pigs. The pigs were hemorrhaged stepwise to a BP of 80 and 45 mm Hg, followed by retransfusion. PtCO2 was measured in the groin and subcutaneous PO2 was measured in the hip region. Intraluminal PCO2 was measured in the stomach, in the small intestine, and the sigmoid colon using silicone catheters. A simultaneous determination of arterial blood HCO3 concentration allowed pHi to be calculated using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Cardiac output was determined by thermodilution, and oxygen delivery (DO2) was calculated. RESULTS: Early indications of shock were decreases in PtCO2 and intestinal pHi (p less than .01). All measured variables decreased at the second step of bleeding. PtCO2 and subcutaneous PO2 was correlated to DO2 through the entire experiment (r2 = .25 and .49, respectively). Also, the pHi of the small intestine and the sigmoid colon correlated with DO2 (r2 = .36 and .25, respectively). PtCO2 and subcutaneous PO2 correlated with pHi in the small intestine and sigmoid colon. CONCLUSIONS: PtCO2 and pHi in the small intestine and sigmoid colon were the variables that most rapidly indicated blood volume loss. Subcutaneous PO2 and PtCO2, and small intestine and sigmoid colon pHi were correlated to total body oxygen transport. Peripheral tissue perfusion followed intestinal perfusion to some extent. \nMechanical cardiac valvular prostheses. Mechanical cardiac valvular prostheses currently enjoy a 60% to 40% market-share advantage over tissue prostheses in the United States and worldwide. Only the Starr-Edwards caged Silastic (Dow Corning) ball, Medtronic-Hall, St. Jude Medical, and Omniscience valves remain available in the United States. Although each valve has certain advantages and disadvantages, no design has achieved functional mechanical perfection. Late follow-up of valve-related complications from the literature favors the St. Jude Medical and Medtronic-Hall valves. \nSudden death due to disease flare with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for carcinoma of the prostate. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for prostate cancer is a new method of management for metastatic disease. During the initial 1 to 2-week period of administration an increase in serum testosterone concentration can lead to an exacerbation of clinical symptoms (flare phenomenon). Two patients are summarized who received luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy without flare blockade and died suddenly during month 1 of therapy. A review of 765 patients in 9 series found 10.9% who suffered disease flare and 15 who died during disease flare. Of these 17 patients 12 were similar to our 2. These data suggest that any patient placed on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for prostate cancer merits some form of flare blockade during the initial 1 or 2 months of therapy. \nA nurse-managed special care unit. The authors describe the first year of operation of a nurse-managed intensive care unit (ICU). Concerned with the problems, costs, and inadequacies of caring for long-term patients in traditional ICUs, nurse administrators designed a special care unit that incorporates a physical design facilitating family involvement and rehabilitative care, registered nurse case management, and a shared governance management philosophy. Compared with traditional ICUs, the effectiveness of the special care unit is tested in terms of patient and nurse outcomes. Implications of this innovation for health-care delivery systems and the nursing profession are discussed. \nResting energy expenditure in chronic cardiac failure. 1. Resting energy expenditure has previously been shown to be elevated in the acute phase of heart failure, but the situation in the compensated state of chronic cardiac failure is unclear. Resting energy expenditure was assessed in 14 patients with stable chronic cardiac failure and 14 matched control subjects by using indirect calorimetry. 2. Resting energy expenditure was significantly elevated in the patients with chronic cardiac failure (112.6 +/- 18.1 versus 87.1 +/- 12.2 kJ day-1 kg-1 total body weight, P less than 0.0002; mean +/- SD) as were resting O2 consumption (3.88 +/- 0.64 versus 3.00 +/- 0.43 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.0002), ventilation (164 +/- 40.3 versus 104 +/- 16.2 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.0001) and heart rate (85.8 +/- 16.9 versus 66.6 +/- 6.9 beats/min, P less than 0.001). Both the resting plasma concentration of noradrenaline (4.48 +/- 1.52 versus 2.28 +/- 0.96 nmol/l, P less than 0.0001) and the serum concentration of free fatty acids (0.78 +/- 0.21 versus 0.57 +/- 0.27 mmol/l, P less than 0.03) were greater in the patients with chronic cardiac failure. Analysis of covariance indicated that most of the difference in resting energy expenditure could be accounted for by the elevated ventilation in the patients with chronic cardiac failure. Arm muscle area, an index of wasting, was lower in the patients with chronic cardiac failure (39.1 +/- 13.1 versus 50.5 +/- 9.4 cm2, P less than 0.02) and resting energy expenditure was found to account for some of this difference. 3. We conclude that an elevated basal metabolism occurs in chronic cardiac failure. \nComplication of a penile prosthesis reservoir: venous compression masquerading as a deep venous thrombosis. We report a case of vascular compromise secondary to the reservoir of an inflatable penile prosthesis. The problem masqueraded as deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity of a patient 3 years after a spinal cord injury. \nMicroangiopathy of the brain, retina, and ear: improvement without immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a pregnant young woman with branch retinal arteriolar occlusions, encephalopathy, and hearing loss in whom we demonstrated a patent foramen ovale. She improved while receiving anticoagulants and no immunosuppressive therapy. The microangiopathic syndrome of retinopathy, encephalopathy, and deafness may be due to a disturbance of coagulation and/or microembolism. \nCholedocholithiasis in acute gallstone pancreatitis. Incidence and clinical significance. A prospective study of choledocholithiasis was performed using 110 patients with presumptive diagnoses of acute gallstone pancreatitis. The incidence of migrating and persistent bile duct stones was determined using stool screening and intraoperative cholangiography, and the clinical significance of continued stone obstruction of the papilla was investigated using ultrasound assessment of migration time and a second evaluation of prognostic signs. Pancreatic inflammation was confirmed at surgery in 51 patients, of whom only 27 had stones in the stools (n = 22) or the bile duct (n = 5), suggesting that choledocholithiasis may not be the sole triggering factor of acute gallstone pancreatitis. Neither delayed migration nor persistent stone obstruction of the papilla promoted pancreatic inflammation. \nA temperature-dependent rabbit model for production of dermal lesions by Haemophilus ducreyi. The fact that optimal in vitro growth of Haemophilus ducreyi occurs at 33 degrees C prompted evaluation of the effect of temperature on the ability of this organism to produce skin lesions in rabbits after intradermal inoculation. Animals housed at a reduced ambient temperature (15-17 degrees C) consistently developed necrotic lesions when injected intradermally with 10(5) cfu of H. ducreyi; this inoculum did not produce necrotic lesions in animals housed at normal room temperature (23-25 degrees C). Lesion production in this new model was dependent on both viability of the H. ducreyi inoculum and replication of these organisms after intradermal injection. Histopathologic examination of the lesions revealed that H. ducreyi infection of the rabbit dermis evolves from an acute inflammatory reaction to abscess formation. Evaluation of three additional strains of H. ducreyi in this model confirmed that lesion formation was not bacterial strain-dependent. This new temperature-dependent rabbit model for productive H. ducreyi infection will facilitate investigation of the molecular pathogenesis of chancroid. \nCutaneous type of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma in a French West Indian woman. Clonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor beta and gamma genes and monoclonal integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the skin infiltrate. A 45-year-old woman, a native of the French West Indies who had lived in France since 1973, developed multiple cutaneous plaques and nodules in 1987. Histopathologic studies revealed dermal infiltration with mature activated T cells (CD4+, CD25+, DR+) with nuclear convolutions and epidermatotropisim. High titers of specific human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I antibodies were detected in the serum. Molecular analysis of DNA extracted from the skin tumor biopsy specimen showed a clonal integration of an HTLV-I provirus and a T-cell clonal population as demonstrated by T-cell receptor beta and gamma gene rearrangement studies. Neither HTLV-I provirus nor T-cell receptor rearrangements were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells DNA despite the presence of rare adult T cell leukemia cells (less than 1%) and a small excess of DR-expressing cells, and detection of HTLV-I Pol and Px sequences by in vitro gene amplification. In this case only gene analysis of the skin lesions made possible an early diagnosis of a cutaneous adult T cell leukemia. This illustrates the need for such molecular studies to differentiate, in HTLV-I seropositive patients from endemic areas, a HTLV-I-induced T cell lymphoma from HTLV-I-nonrelated cutaneous T cell lymphomas. \nLuteinizing hormone (LH) secretory burst duration is independent from LH, prolactin, or gonadal steroid plasma levels in amenorrheic women. The possible presence of LH pulsatile secretion has been studied in patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea [LH plasma levels, less than 3 (n = 35) or greater than 3 IU/L (n = 18)], amenorrhea associated with hyperandrogenemia (n = 31), or hyperprolactinemia (n = 10). Patients were sampled every 10 min for 4 h, and LH plasma concentrations were determined by the use of an immunofluorimetric assay. The program Detect was used for both pulse detection and data deconvolution, i.e. for instantaneous secretory rate computation, on LH time series. The presence of episodic LH secretion was observed in all patients, and LH pulse frequency ranged between 3.5 +/- 0.3 and 3.8 +/- 0.2 peaks/4 h among the four groups. LH pulse amplitude was significantly reduced in patients affected by hypothalamic amenorrhea with LH plasma levels lower than 3 IU/L (0.7 +/- 0.1 IU/L; P less than 0.01) and significantly increased in patients with hyperandrogenic amenorrhea (6.8 +/- 0.3 IU/L; P less than 0.01) compared to levels in the other groups under study. Instantaneous secretory rate computation permitted the optimal resolution of the secretory events and demonstrated that the duration of gonadotrope secretory bursts ranged from 22.8 +/- 1.4 to 26.8 +/- 2.3 min in amenorrheic patients and did not depend on LH, PRL, or sex steroid plasma levels. In conclusion, the present study shows the presence of significant LH pulsatile release in amenorrheic patients, suggesting that in amenorrheic, as in normally cycling, women the secretory bursts from the gonadotropes have the same duration, despite the plasma LH, PRL, or steroid hormone levels. \nCarcinoid tumor of the common bile duct: evidence for its origin in metaplastic endocrine cells. Carcinoid tumors of the extrahepatic bile ducts are extremely rare neoplasms. The authors report the case of a 36-yr-old male patient with a carcinoid tumor that arose in the common hepatic bile duct. The non-neoplastic mucosa showed areas of gastric and intestinal metaplasia that included scattered argyrophil endocrine cells. Since the normal mucosa of the bile ducts lacks the latter type of cells, this case provides evidence for the first time that carcinoid tumors of this anatomic site probably originate from metaplastic endocrine cells. \nOccult pontine glioma in a patient with hemifacial spasm. Hemifacial spasm due to an intracranial mass lesion is rare. We describe a 29-year-old man with hemifacial spasm successfully treated with botulinum A toxin injections for 2 years. The development of acquired diplopia secondary to acquired sixth cranial nerve palsy prompted investigation. Computed tomography done at the time of original diagnosis and on three other occasions (concentrating on the brain stem and cerebellopontine angle) failed to demonstrate an intracranial mass lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large mass lesion in the pons presumed to be a glioma. Patients with hemifacial spasm who have atypical features, especially those with associated neurologic findings, should be screened for tumours. Our case illustrates the superiority of MRI in demonstrating pontine gliomas causing hemifacial spasm. \nHyperinsulinaemia in thyrotoxic hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. To test the hypothesis that there is an abnormal serum insulin response to a carbohydrate load in thyrotoxic hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (THPP), 18 men with THPP and 15 with uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis were studied during an oral glucose tolerance test. The THPP group had significantly higher fasting insulin concentrations (27.6 [3.6] vs 13.4 [1.8] mU/l; p less than 0.005) and a higher overall insulin response to oral glucose (p less than 0.001 by ANOVA) than the thyrotoxicosis group. There were no significant differences in fasting or stimulated glucose. Hyperinsulinaemia may be an important factor in the precipitation of acute paralysis in THPP. \nBlunt trauma-induced pacemaker failure. A 54-year-old man with an artificial pacemaker sustained blunt trauma to his chest when he was struck with a baseball bat. Within 15 minutes after the injury, the patient experienced cardiovascular collapse. His pacemaker failed, and he required insertion of a temporary transvenous pacemaker. At surgery, the defect was traced to failure of the pulse generator, a rare cause of pacemaker failure. Emergency department evaluation should include prompt and continuous ECG monitoring, an overpenetrated chest radiograph, and telemetry evaluation after discharge. \nMR imaging in fibromatosis: results in 26 patients with pathologic correlation. Fibromatoses are a diverse group of soft-tissue lesions that have been inconsistently categorized and treated. The purpose of our study was to establish the range of appearances of fibromatoses on MR images and perform a pathologic correlation to explain the variable signal-intensity patterns. During a 3-year period, 26 patients with deep fibromatoses were examined with MR. The MR images were evaluated for signal-intensity characteristics, and findings were correlated retrospectively with the pathologic diagnoses. The results showed that the MR appearance of fibromatoses is similar to that of other soft-tissue lesions, and the signal intensities vary greatly from lesion to lesion and within lesions themselves. The fibromatoses were either hyperintense, isointense, hypointense, or of mixed signal intensity relative to adjacent skeletal muscle. The hypointense areas appear to be zones of hypocellularity and dense collagen deposition. Microscopically all of the lesions invaded adjacent structures, but the MR appearances of the margins varied and were judged to be well demarcated (n = 14), intermediate (n = 5), or poorly demarcated (n = 6). Our experience shows that fibromatoses have a variable MR appearance no different from that of other soft-tissue lesions, and this variability reflects the composition and cellularity of the lesions. \nGLI3 zinc-finger gene interrupted by translocations in Greig syndrome families. The Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting limb and craniofacial development in humans. GCPS-affected individuals are characterized by postaxial polysyndactyly of hands, preaxial polysyndactyly of feet, macroephaly, a broad base of the nose with mild hypertelorism and a prominent forehead. The genetic locus has been pinpointed to chromosome 7p13 by three balanced translocations associated with GCPS in different families. This assignment is corroborated by the detection of two sporadic GCPS cases carrying overlapping deletions in 7p13 (ref. 7), as well as by tight linkage of GCPS to the epidermal growth factor receptor gene in 7p12-13 (ref. 8). Of the genes that map to this region, those encoding T cell receptor-gamma, interferon-beta 2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and Hox1.4, a potential candidate gene for GCPS, have been excluded from the region in which the deletions overlap. Here we show that two of the three translocations interup the GLI3 gene, a zinc-finger gene of the GLI-Kruppel family already localized to 7p13 (refs 5, 6). The breakpoints are within the first third of the coding sequence. In the third translocation, chromosome 7 is broken at about 10 kilobases downstream of the 3' end of GLI3. Our results indicate that mutations disturbing normal GLI3 expression may have a causative role in GCPS. \nSupraglottic carcinoma: impact of radiation therapy on outcome of patients with positive margins and extracapsular nodal disease. Seventy-nine patients with supraglottic carcinoma treated between 1966 and 1985 are reviewed. All patients were treated with surgery and postoperative radiation therapy. Thirty-five percent of the patients had positive margins at the site of resection of the primary tumor. Of the 25 patients who had positive nodal disease, 13 patients (52%) had either extracapsular extension or soft-tissue or adjacent organ invasion, referred to in composite as \"grave signs.\" The median follow-up of the patients was 4.9 years and all patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years. The disease-free survival for all patients was 76% at 2 years and 71% at 3 years. The locoregional control rate for all patients was 70%. This study demonstrates that there is no difference in local recurrence or disease-free survival, or time to recurrence relative to the status of the surgical margins, which may be a benefit of the postoperative radiation therapy. This study also demonstrates that there is an increase in the number of patients with grave signs with increasing nodal stage. The rate of neck recurrence in patients with grave signs was substantially higher (54%) than in patients without grave signs (8%), even though these patients also had positive lymph nodes. Interestingly, there was also a higher rate of local recurrence among patients who had grave signs. Patients receiving doses higher than 6000 cGy to the primary site had fewer local failures, although within each group of patients with positive or negative surgical margins the differences in survival were minimal. \nComparison of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and American Joint Committee on Cancer staging systems among patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving hyperfractionated radiation therapy. A report of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol 83-11. Since 1973, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has staged and stratified patients in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) protocols according to the RTOG staging system. In 1985, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) revised its lung cancer staging system, with the principle differences from the RTOG system being the staging of involvement of the chest wall and of contralateral mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. To determine if the AJCC system discriminated outcome differently than the RTOG system in a nonoperative series, all 850 evaluable patients treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (RT) on the RTOG protocol 83-11 were restaged by the AJCC system. There was 67% agreement in patient distribution between the following comparable stages in each system: RTOG Stage II/AJCC Stage II; RTOG Stage III/AJCC Stage IIIA; and RTOG Stage IV/AJCC Stage IIIB. Both systems successfully predicted for survival (P less than 0.001), although the RTOG staging was more discriminating (relative risk ratios, 1.59 versus 1.38). Among the 507 favorable patients (those with less than or equal to 5% weight loss and Karnofsky performance status [KPS] of 70 to 100), the RTOG staging was also more predictive (P = 0.004 versus P = 0.01). When RTOG Stage III (462 patients) was divided into those without contralateral mediastinal or hilar adenopathy (AJCC Stage II/IIIA) and those with (AJCC Stage IIIB), a significant survival (P = 0.0001) was noted with 2-year survival rates of 26% versus 4%, respectively. When AJCC Stage IIIA (348 patients) was divided into the patients without chest wall invasion (RTOG Stage II/III) and those with (RTOG Stage IV), a difference in 2-year survival of 22% versus 10% was observed (P = 0.002). Although both staging systems independently predict for survival, a fusion of both staging systems is the most discriminating of outcome. Future nonoperative studies in locally advanced NSCLC should stratify for contralateral nodal involvement (per AJCC staging) and chest wall invasion (per RTOG staging). \nSurvival after resection of carcinoma of the splenic flexure. Nine hundred ten patients undergoing colectomy for colon cancer were studied retrospectively. Seventy-four cancers (8 percent) were located at the splenic flexure. The stage at presentation was no different between splenic flexure cancers and colon carcinomas at other sites. Although splenic flexure cancers had twice the incidence of obstruction as did other colon cancers and obstruction in the overall series adversely affected survival, there was no difference in survival between splenic flexure cancer patients and patients with other colon cancers. \nCortical magnetic resonance imaging changes in elderly inpatients with major depression. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of elderly depressed patients differ from MRI scans of age-matched control subjects and age-matched patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: The authors studied 21 patients 60 years or older with major depression, 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 14 age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: Compared to control subjects, depressed patients had greater cerebral sulcal and temporal sulcal atrophy; larger sylvian fissures, lateral ventricles, third ventricles, and temporal horns; and greater severity of subcortical white matter lesions. Depressed patients also had more basal ganglia lesions but similar levels of periventricular hyperintensity. There were no differences between depressed patients with and without delusions on any MRI measure. Depressed patients who received ECT had more temporal horn atrophy and greater subcortical abnormality summary scores than normal subjects. Cortical sulcal atrophy correlated with age at onset of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that elderly hospitalized depressed patients have greater cortical as well as subcortical atrophy and more basal ganglia lesions than age-matched normal control subjects. The correlation of these abnormalities with outcome remains unknown. \nCapsaicin-sensitive nerves mediate esophageal mucosal protection. The esophageal mucosa is exposed to damaging agents both by ingestion and reflux. Using our in vivo rabbit model of esophagitis, we have observed that acute luminal exposure (within 1 to 5 minutes) to potentially harmful agents, such as acid, bile, or ethanol, induces a rapid increase in mucosal blood flow; whereas prolonged exposure (10 to 60 minutes) results in mucosal injury and ablation of blood flow. We have also shown that capsaicin-sensitive mucosal afferent nerves can modulate esophageal blood flow. These findings led us to hypothesize that the reactive increase in blood flow induced by luminal agents represents a mechanism of protection mediated by capsaicin-sensitive nerves. The objective of these experiments was to determine if luminal capsaicin, a specific probe for visceral afferent nerves, could both preserve mucosal blood flow and protect against ethanol injury. Rabbits were subjected to luminal instillation of 50% ethanol with or without 1% capsaicin. Blood flow was measured with microspheres at baseline and after 2 and 10 minutes. Rabbits exposed only to ethanol developed severe mucosal injury coincident with near ablation of mucosal blood flow. In contrast, rabbits exposed to ethanol with capsaicin showed protection of the epithelium with a sixfold increase in mucosal blood flow. We conclude that capsaicin-sensitive nerves in the esophagus are local effectors of mucosal protection by virtue of preserving blood flow. \nParaprosthetic leak: a complication of cardiac valve replacement. Paraprosthetic leak (PPL) is a rare but potentially serious complication of cardiac valve replacement. Between 1974 and 1988, 1175 prosthetic valves were implanted in 1026 patients by one cardiac surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital, London. Of these 539 (52.5%) were aortic (AVR), 334 (32.6%) mitral (MVR), 7 (0.7%) tricuspid, and 144 (14%) AV and MV double valve replacements (DVR). There were only 2 triple valve replacements. The prosthetic valves implanted were the Starr-Edwards (7%), Bjork Shiley (11.8%), Lillehei-Kaster (23%), Carpentier-Edwards bioprosthesis (35.2%), Duromedics bileaflet (16.4%) and a variety of other mechanical and bioprosthetic valves (6.6%). Over the 15 year period there were a total of 82 (7%) valve failures of which PPL was diagnosed in 29 (2.5%) valves in 24 patients. Presenting features included cardiac decompensation in 72%, bacterial endocarditis in 12% and haemolytic anaemia in 12%. One patient (4%) had no symptoms. Nineteen patients underwent re-operation. Median time to re-operation was 15 months (range 1-65 months) with a re-operative mortality of 22%. Clinical evidence of prosthetic valve infection was found in 79% of MVR and 67% of AVR. A heavily calcified aortic annulus, found in 47% of patients, may also have contributed to PPL after AVR. \nSun-related skin diseases. Severe photoaging of the skin, which may be caused by exposure to both natural and artificial ultraviolet light, ultimately results in actinic keratoses and cancer. Cancers are common on the head, neck, arms, and hands. Because of the potential for metastasis, squamous cell carcinomas generally require surgical excision and histologic examination. Although metastasis is rare with basal cell carcinoma, neglected lesions around the eyes, nose, or ears can invade bone, nerves, and cartilage and may cause death. Avoidance of sun, physical protection, and regular use of sunscreens are recommended. \nFrom Papanicolaou to Bethesda: the rationale for a new cervical cytologic classification. The Bethesda System for reporting cervical/vaginal diagnoses was introduced to replace the numerical Papanicolaou class designations, thereby facilitating precise communication between cytopathologist and clinician. The terminology for squamous epithelial lesions includes the following categories: 1) atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; 2) squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), which encompasses the spectrum of squamous cell carcinoma precursors, divided into low-grade SIL (human papillomavirus [HPV]-associated cellular changes, mild dysplasia, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] I) and high-grade SIL (moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ and CIN II and III); and 3) squamous cell carcinoma. The rationale for including HPV-related changes (koilocytosis) with CIN I within low-grade SIL is based on the morphologic, behavioral, and virologic similarity of these two lesions, which precludes their separation in a consistent and reliable fashion. For the same reasons, CIN II and III lesions have been combined within the category of high-grade SIL. The term \"atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance\" is used for cytologic findings that do not fulfill the criteria for defined benign reactive changes or SIL. Therefore, this term is more restricted in usage as compared with the wide range of interpretations previously ascribed to \"atypia\" or \"inflammatory atypia.\". \nInfluence of balloon size and stenosis morphology on immediate and delayed elastic recoil after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. After successful coronary angioplasty, the minimal luminal diameter of the dilated coronary artery segment is generally smaller than the diameter of the largest balloon catheter at the maximal inflation pressure. The determinants of this phenomenon were studied in 28 patients. Biplane angiograms were obtained after intracoronary administration of isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) before, immediately and 24 h after coronary angioplasty. Balloon and coronary luminal diameters were measured by automated contour detection. Immediately after the procedure, the difference between inflated balloon diameter and minimal luminal diameter averaged 0.93 +/- 0.43 mm for the entire group and was greater both in eccentric stenoses (1.13 +/- 0.39 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.36 mm; p less than 0.01) and after angioplasty with an oversized balloon (1.20 +/- 0.37 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.33 mm; p less than 0.005). At 24 h, the balloon - minimal luminal diameter difference was unchanged at the group level (0.86 +/- 0.38 mm, but the minimal luminal diameter increased significantly in the subgroup of coronary segments dilated with an oversized balloon (1.97 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.81 +/- 0.28 mm; p less than 0.05). Thus, the difference between the minimal diameter of a dilated coronary segment immediately after a successful coronary balloon angioplasty procedure and the maximal diameter of the inflated balloon catheter is dependent both on eccentricity of the stenosis and on the balloon/artery diameter ratio. Moreover, the increase in minimal luminal diameter 24 h after angioplasty performed with an oversized balloon suggest that in addition to elastic recoil partly reversible factors related to vessel barotrauma are involved. \nImmunoreactive transforming growth factor alpha is commonly present in colorectal neoplasia. Surgical specimens from 19 patients with invasive colorectal cancers and 12 specimens of normal mucosa from the same patients were examined immunohistochemically for the production of the immunoreactive (IR-) transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and IR-epidermal growth factor (EGF) with an anti-TGF-alpha monoclonal antibody (MAb) OAL-MTG01 and anti-EGF MAb KEM-10. Immunoreactive TGF-alpha was detected in 16 (84.2%) of 19 colorectal cancers. In contrast, there was no IR-TGF-alpha in the gland cells of normal mucosa. Immunoreactive EGF was detected in 7 (36.8%) of 19 colorectal cancers and 1 (8.3%) of 12 cases of normal mucosa. The production of both IR-TGF-alpha and IR-EGF in colorectal cancer did not differ by histologic type and Dukes' stage. Immunoreactive TGF-alpha was detected at significantly higher incidence than IR-EGF in colorectal cancer. These results indicate that IR-TGF-alpha should prove valuable as a possible tumor marker in colorectal cancers, and it may be very useful in understanding the biology of colorectal cancer. \nComparison of chest pain, electrocardiographic changes and thallium-201 scintigraphy during varying exercise intensities in men with stable angina pectoris. This study was performed to evaluate the presence of angina pectoris, electrocardiographic changes and reversible thallium-201 defects resulting from 2 different levels of exercise in 19 patients with known coronary artery disease and evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. The exercise protocols consisted of a symptom-limited incremental exercise test (Bruce protocol) followed within 3 to 14 days by a submaximal, steady-state exercise test performed at 70% of the maximal heart rate achieved during the Bruce protocol. The presence and time of onset of angina and electrocardiographic changes (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV ST-segment depression) as well as oxygen uptake, exercise duration and pressure-rate product were recorded. Thallium-201 (2.5 to 3.0 mCi) was injected during the last minute of exercise during both protocols, and the images were analyzed using both computer-assisted quantitation and visual interpretations. Incremental exercise resulted in anginal symptoms in 84% of patients, and electrocardiographic changes and reversible thallium-201 defects in all patients. In contrast, submaximal exercise produced anginal symptoms in only 26% (p less than 0.01) and electrocardiographic changes in only 47% (p less than 0.05), but resulted in thallium-201 defects in 89% of patients (p = not significant). The locations of the thallium-201 defects, when present, were not different between the 2 exercise protocols. These findings confirm the sequence of the ischemic cascade using 2 levels of exercise and demonstrate that the cascade theory is applicable during varying ischemic intensities in the same patient. \nHypoxaemia during anaesthesia--an observer study. We have investigated 296 inpatients in a single-blind observer study to determine the incidence, degree and duration of hypoxaemia during anaesthesia. The clinical recognition of hypoxaemia, period of time until recognition and risk factors were studied. Oxygen saturation (Spo2) was monitored continuously with a pulse oximeter (Ohmeda, model 3700). One or more episodes of mild hypoxaemia (Spo2 86-90%) were recorded in 53% of patients. Severe hypoxaemia with Spo2 values less than 81% were recorded in 20% of patients. The mild hypoxaemic episodes lasted up to 34.6 min (mean 2.3 min) and 70% were not detected by the anaesthetist. In the remaining 30% of episodes, the anaesthetist diagnosed the complication with a mean time delay of 70 s. After intervention a mean time delay of 57 s was recorded until Spo2 exceeded 90%. Utilizing a stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that risk factors associated with a greater incidence of hypoxaemia were patient age (P less than 0.005) and anaesthetic technique (P less than 0.00001). We conclude that hypoxaemic episodes in our operating rooms are common during anaesthesia and suggest preoxygenation in all patients in addition to administration of supplementary oxygen during arousal from anaesthesia and during transfer to the recovery room. \nPortal venous barium intravasation complicating barium enema examination. Venous intravasation of contrast is a potentially life-threatening complication of the barium enema examination. A patient in whom portal venous contrast intravasation was nearly fatal is presented, and the significant morbidity and mortality from this unusual event is reviewed. Since barium infiltration into the venous system almost always occurs in the setting of altered mucosal integrity, this examination should be used cautiously in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis. Prompt recognition and rapid resuscitation are critical to the survival of patients with contrast intravasation. \nTricuspid atresia: association with persistent truncus arteriosus. Clinical, echo-Doppler, and pathologic data of a rare case of tricuspid atresia in association with truncus arteriosus are presented. There are only six patients (including the patient reported here) with this anomaly in whom detailed pathologic and/or clinical descriptions are available in the literature. An additional six cases were mentioned in the literature but without any details. A prevalence rate of 1.4% among tricuspid atresia cases is estimated. All infants presented with symptoms of cyanosis and/or congestive heart failure within a few days to 2 months after birth and died shortly thereafter. Cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings on the chest x-ray film and left axis deviation with left ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG are usually present. Echocardiographic, catheterization, and angiocardiographic studies are helpful in documenting anatomic and physiologic features of this anomaly. Pathologically, the muscular type of tricuspid atresia, type I or II truncus arteriosus, a large subtruncal VSD, and a hypoplastic right ventricle are present. It is concluded that coexistence of tricuspid atresia and truncus arteriosus is rare; clinical, laboratory, and pathologic features are distinctive; the clinical presentation early in life with rapid demise is common; and prompt palliative surgery immediately after recognition of this anomaly should be undertaken. \nAssociation of exotoxin-producing group A streptococci and severe disease in children. Clinical features and microbiologic data on all cases of serious (hospitalized) Group A streptococcal infections in children managed at our institution between 1985 and 1988 are presented. All 6 cases were caused by toxin-producing strains. Four of 6 were toxin A-producing strains whereas none of 58 community-acquired (Group A streptococcal) pharyngeal isolates in the same period was a toxin A producer. A review of the literature on the incidence of toxin A-producing strains provides information suggesting a resurgence of such strains in the late 1980s after a relative disappearance of toxin B production in isolates from these patients was also significantly greater than in the isolates acquired from the community in uncomplicated pharyngitis. These findings suggest a role for exotoxin in severe manifestations of Group A streptococcal disease in children. \nDistribution of thymic tissue in the mediastinal adipose tissue. The distribution of thymic tissue in the anterior mediastinal, retrocarinal, and preaortic fat was examined histologically in 27 autopsy subjects. Thymic tissue was found in the anterior mediastinal fat in 12 subjects (44.4%), in the retrocarinal fat in two (7.4%), and in the preaortic fat in none. The finding of ectopic thymic tissue in these areas has not been reported previously, would appear to be surgically inaccessible via a median sternotomy, and may be responsible in part for some of the failures of thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. \nIdentifying anterior segment crystals. A series of 22 patients with crystals in the anterior segment of the eye was examined by specular microscopy. Of 10 patients with hypermature cataract and hyperrefringent bodies in the anterior chamber cholesterol crystals were identified in four patients and in six of the 10 in whom aspirate was obtained cholesterol crystals were demonstrated in three, two of these having shown crystals on specular microscopy. In 10 patients with intracorneal crystalline deposits, cholesterol crystals were found on specular microscopy, including one case of Schnyder's crystalline corneal dystrophy. Of two patients with multiple myeloma, corneal crystals were demonstrated in one. Crystals of the anterior segment of the eye are most likely to be cholesterol, and identification is important for future treatment. \nSimple examination techniques to aid in the diagnosis of urethral diverticulum. Patients with urethral diverticula classically present with dyspareunia, dribbling of urine, chronic dysuria, and/or a tender suburethral mass. Physical examination, urethroscopy, positive pressure urethrography, and the urethral pressure profile may not confirm the suspected diagnosis. Three simple diagnostic maneuvers are presented to aid in confirming the diagnosis before surgical exploration. \nSymptomatic and silent gall stones in the community. The prevalence of gall stone disease in a stratified random sample of 1896 British adults (72.2% of those approached) was established using real time ultrasound. The prevalence rose with age, except in women of 40-49 years, so that at 60-69 years, 22.4% of women and 11.5% of men had gall stones or had undergone cholecystectomy. The cholecystectomy rate of people with gall stone disease was higher in women than in men (43.5% v 24%, p less than 0.05). Very few subjects with gall stones had convincing biliary symptoms. In women, 10.4% had symptoms according to a questionnaire definition of biliary pain and 6.3% according to conventional history taking, while no men at all admitted to biliary pain. Nevertheless, cholecystectomy in men had nearly always been preceded by convincing biliary symptoms. The age at cholecystectomy was, on average, nine years less than the age at detection of silent gall stones in both sexes. It is concluded that either gall stones are especially prone to cause symptoms in younger people or that there are two kinds of cholelithiasis - symptomatic and silent. The lack of symptomatic gall stones in cross sectional surveys is probably due to their rapid diagnosis and treatment. \nGenetic susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. Genetic factors clearly cause Lewy-body Parkinson's disease (PD) in a subset of autosomal-dominant families. However, most cases of PD are sporadic. The two most likely models of four discussed for sporadic PD are the reduced penetrance model and the multifactorial model. Sporadic PD is likely to be caused by the combined effect of environmental precipitating factors and genetic susceptibility factors. Because the number of major genetic factors is likely to be small, these hypotheses can be tested and genetic factors located using linkage mapping techniques. The affected pair analysis methods are especially suited to PD. Finding the genetic susceptibility factors for PD is important because this may be the fastest way to identify the environmental precipitating factors and because it may lead to prevention of PD. Because of the usefulness of identifying genetic susceptibility factors for PD, we are carrying out linkage studies in a group of 16 large autosomal-dominant families with PD and more than 300 living affected PD pairs. \nThe rhombotin family of cysteine-rich LIM-domain oncogenes: distinct members are involved in T-cell translocations to human chromosomes 11p15 and 11p13. A chromosomal translocation in a T-cell leukemia involving the short arm of human chromosome 11 at band 11p15 disrupts the rhombotin gene. This gene encodes a protein with duplicated cysteine-rich regions called LIM domains, which show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Two homologues of the rhombotin gene have now been isolated. One of these, designated Rhom-2, is located on human chromosome 11 at band 11p13, where a cluster of T-cell leukemia-specific translocations occur; all translocation breakpoints at 11p13 are upstream of the Rhom-2 gene. Human and mouse Rhom-2 are highly conserved and, like rhombotin, encode two tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains. Rhom-2 mRNA is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus. The other gene, designated Rhom-3, is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the LIM domain of rhombotin. Since the Rhom-2 gene is such a common site of chromosomal damage in T-cell tumors, the consistency of translocations near the rhombotin gene was further examined. A second translocation adjacent to rhombotin was found and at the same position as in the previous example. Therefore, chromosome bands 11p15 (rhombotin) and 11p13 (Rhom-2) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in T-cell leukemia, with the 11p15 target more rarely involved. The results define the rhombotin gene family as a class of T-cell oncogenes with duplicated cysteine-rich LIM domains. \nDifferent mechanisms of polyuria and natriuresis associated with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The mechanism of polyuria associated with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) was investigated in 8 patients. SVT was induced artificially and sustained for 60 minutes. Urine and blood samples were collected every 30 minutes. During the latter half of SVT, urine flow increased twofold in the control subjects before SVT. Urinary sodium excretion increased significantly (p less than 0.01) within 30 minutes after SVT. Urinary excretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) decreased (p less than 0.01) during the latter half of SVT and increased (p less than 0.01) after SVT, respectively. Plasma level of ADH did not change during SVT but increased (p less than 0.05) after SVT. The concentration of plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) increased significantly (p less than 0.05) before SVT ended. Urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 increased significantly (p less than 0.05) after termination of SVT. The percent changes in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 were correlated (r = 0.713, p less than 0.001) with those of ADH. There was also a correlation (r = 0.6, p less than 0.001) between the percent changes in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and those of sodium. Their findings suggest that the polyuria during SVT is attributed mainly to the inhibition of ADH release and that the natriuresis after SVT is due not only to the increased ANP but also to the increased renal prostaglandin E2 probably stimulated by ADH. \nComparison of acute and chronic protein-energy malnutrition on host antitumor immune mechanisms. Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) is prevalent in cancer patients. However, the effect of PCM on anti-tumor immunity is unclear and critically important in an era of improving results with adoptive immunotherapy. This study examined the effect of short- and long-term PCM on tumor-specific and natural immune effector mechanisms in a murine neuroblastoma (C1300 NRB) model. A/J mice received an isocaloric 2.5% or 24% casein diet for 3 or 8 weeks before inoculation with tumor. Three weeks later lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested for determination of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Both 3 and 8 weeks of PCM significantly reduced mean total body weight by 25% (p less than 0.001) and 41% (p less than 0.001), respectively, compared with regularly nourished mice. Short-term PCM did not inhibit CTL or NK cytotoxicity, whereas long-term PCM significantly diminished CTL generation (p less than 0.001) but preserved NK cytotoxic function. These results indicate that CTL development against autologous tumor, in contrast to basal NK function, is dependent on host nutritional status. Mean tumor growth, determined by tumor-weight to carcass-weight ratio, was unchanged for both short- and long-term protein-energy deprived groups compared with results in regularly nourished mice. These findings suggest that NK function is the predominant effector mechanism inhibiting C1300 NRB growth and that NK tumoricidal capacity is preserved during PCM. \nPathophysiology of isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients: Doppler echocardiographic insights. Systemic hemodynamics were evaluated with aortic pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography in 79 elderly subjects with isolated systolic hypertension participating in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) and were compared with the values in 39 normal age-matched subjects. Cardiac output was elevated (4.50 +/- 1.13 L/min versus 3.94 +/- 1.12 L/min, p less than 0.05) in patients with isolated systolic hypertension in comparison with values in normal elderly subjects. Systemic vascular resistance did not differ between both groups (2140 +/- 536 dyn.sec/cm-5 versus 2011 +/- 553 dyn.sec/cm-5, p = NS). The mean acceleration of blood during left ventricular ejection was similar in patients with isolated systolic hypertension in comparison with normals (12.6 +/- 5.6 m/sec2 versus 11.5 +/- 3.5 m/sec2, p = NS). Patients with isolated systolic hypertension had significantly decreased arterial compliance, as measured by the stroke volume-to-pulse pressure ratio (0.77 +/- 0.26 cm3/mm Hg versus 1.11 +/- 0.30 cm3/mm Hg, p less than 0.0001). The prevalence of aortic and mitral regurgitation as well as valvular and annular calcification did not differ between analyzed groups. Isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients appears to be multifactorial, with reduced arterial compliance and increased cardiac output both playing a role. \nReading problems in adult chronic headache sufferers. In a questionnaire survey we determined the prevalence of problems with reading, at present as well as in the past, in adult chronic headache sufferers as compared with age- and sex-matched controls. The reading problems inquired about were those with reading in general, reading quickly, prolonged reading and reading comprehension. The subjects were also asked about present and past problems with writing, concentrating, performing mathematics and overall learning. Significant differences in the prevalences of the problems studied between the headache sufferers and controls were observed on just two items and only for the female groups. These items were present problems with reading comprehension (39.3% versus 7.5%; p = 0.002) and concentrating (46.4% versus 17.5%; p = 0.015). We concluded that adult female headache sufferers have impaired reading comprehension and concentration abilities which do not seem to originate from the past. \nParamyotonia congenita and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis map to the same sodium-channel gene locus. Paramyotonia congenita (PC), an autosomal dominant muscle disease, shares some clinical and electrophysiological similarities with another myotonic muscle disorder, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP). However, clinical and electrophysiologic differences allow differentiation of the two disorders. The HYPP locus was recently shown to be linked to a skeletal muscle sodium-channel gene probe. We now report that PC maps to the same locus (LOD score 4.4, theta = 0 at assumed penetrance of .95). These linkage results, coupled with physiological data demonstrating abnormal sodium-channel function in patients with PC, implicate a sodium-channel gene as an important candidate for the site of mutation responsible for PC. Furthermore, this is strong evidence for the hypothesis that PC and HYPP are allelic disorders. \nEfficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin in the management of intermittent claudication. Treating chronic arterial occlusive disease with heparin is controversial because of the risks associated with long-term anticoagulant therapy. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (mw about 5000 Dalton), which selectively inhibits the Xa factor with minimal risk of hemorrhage, seems to offer new possibilities in the prevention and treatment of both venous and acute arterial thromboembolism. Therefore, 44 patients with intermittent claudication were recruited to a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Twenty-two were treated for six months with a single daily subcutaneous dose (15,000 UaXa) of LMW heparin and 22 with placebo administered in the same way over the same period of time. After six months, LMW heparin treatment not only improved walking capacity (by lengthening the pain-free walking time by 25%) but also significantly modified the hemorrheologic pattern (by reducing fibrinogen concentrations and whole blood viscosity at low shear rates). LMW heparin also exerted an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic effect by significantly increasing both the anti-Xa factor and plasminogen activity without markedly modifying activated partial thromboplastin time (+20%). No LMW heparin-treated patient hemorrhaged or reported other noteworthy side effects. These results suggest LMW heparin might be a useful drug in the long-term treatment of chronic arterial occlusive disease of the limbs. \nRole of conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to oxidase in ischemic rat liver cell injury. This study was undertaken to determine whether hepatic ischemia and the subsequent reflow of blood have any effect on the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase (XO). Ischemia of the liver for 90 or 120 minutes did not permit survival of the animals. XO represented 15% of the total xanthine dehydrogenase plus XO activity in the control liver. XO activity remained unchanged even after 90 minutes of hepatic ischemia, although a marked increase in lipid peroxide in the liver tissue was observed during the reperfusion. When hepatic ischemia was prolonged for 6 hours (animals were dead), XO activity rose to 35% of the total activity. Incubation of the liver at 37 degrees C resulted in a definite change in XO activity dependent on the length of incubation period. Although no significant changes occurred in XO activity during the first 2 hours of incubation, a marked XO conversion was observed between 2 and 4 hours, and a maximal conversion was achieved after 6 hours of incubation. These results suggest that XO newly generated during ischemia has a very limited role in oxygen free radical production after resuming perfusion. \nIncreased therapeutic index of antineoplastic drugs in combination with intracellular histamine antagonists. L-Histidinol, a protein synthesis inhibitor and structural analogue of L-histidine, has been demonstrated in chemotherapy-treated mice to be cytoprotective to normal stem cells but to enhance cytotoxicity to tumor cells. N,N-Diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl) phenoxy]ethanamine.HCl (DPPE) is an antagonist of recently described microsomal and nuclear intracellular histamine receptors implicated in the mediation of proliferation and modulation of prostaglandin synthesis. DPPE is cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro and cytoprotective to the gut in vivo. Noting the similar pharmacologic profiles for histidinol and DPPE and the structural resemblance between histidinol and histamine, we tested 1) whether binding to intracellular histamine receptors may be important to the action of histidinol, 2) whether there exists a differential effect of DPPE and histidinol on proliferating normal and transformed or malignant cells, and 3) whether DPPE, like histidinol, protects host cells from the effects of chemotherapy while augmenting tumor cell kill in vivo. It was observed that histidinol does compete at intracellular histamine receptors in isolated microsomes and nuclei, but with significantly lower affinity than DPPE. Nevertheless, for each agent, potency at intracellular histamine receptors correlates with potency to inhibit DNA and protein synthesis, without cytotoxicity, in normal mitogen-stimulated murine lymphocytes and to kill transformed mouse lymphocytes or MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. As demonstrated previously for histidinol (1-2 g/kg), DPPE (4 mg/kg) protected murine bone marrow progenitors from doxorubicin or fluorouracil, while doses of 4-50 mg/kg significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of doxorubicin and daunorubicin in murine models of early cancer. One postulate to explain the effects of intracellular histamine receptor ligands is that intracellular histamine mediates DNA and protein synthesis, possibly through a downward modulation of growth-inhibitory prostaglandin levels. Antagonism of the intracellular action of histamine at intracellular histamine receptors by DPPE or histidinol may result in differential perturbations of growth/eicosanoid metabolism in normal and malignant cells, thus forming the basis of a new approach to chemotherapy. \nAlfentanil infusion for postoperative pain: a comparison of epidural and intravenous routes. The efficacy of intravenous (iv) and epidural infusions of alfentanil for postoperative pain relief was investigated in 24 patients (ASA physical status 1-2) who were scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy. The patients were allocated randomly to receive either epidural or iv alfentanil. In both groups, a loading dose of 15 micrograms.kg-1 was administered, followed by a constant rate infusion of 18 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 alfentanil for 20 h. Both routes provided similar degrees of analgesia; however, analgesia occurred earlier in the intravenously treated group (P less than 0.03). Mean plasma alfentanil concentrations (Cps) varied between 42 and 82 ng.ml-1 in the iv group and 23 and 68 ng.ml-1 in the epidural group, with higher concentrations in the iv group for the first 60 min only (P less than 0.01). Cps increased with infusion time, suggesting accumulation of alfentanil. After infusion ended, pain recurred at the same time in both groups, whereas the alfentanil Cps still were greater than 45 ng/ml. Postoperative epinephrine concentrations decreased after 60 min of infusion (P less than 0.02), whereas, after 6 h, cortisol levels decreased to preoperative values. Norepinephrine concentrations decreased only slightly. The only clinically meaningful effect on vital signs that occurred was an abrupt reduction of respiratory rate after the iv loading dose. PaCO2 increased to the same extent in both groups during the first 15 min only. The incidence of opioid-related side effects was similar in both groups. These results suggest that the iv and epidural routes were equally effective for providing postoperative pain control and controlling the postoperative response to surgical stress. \nDendritic hypertrophy in Purkinje neurons of old Fischer 344 rats after long-term ethanol treatment. Metric parameters of Purkinje cell dendritic networks in 24- to 26-month-old Fischer 344 rats were determined after 48 weeks of chronic ethanol intake. Measurements included the total number and length of all segments/network, the total number and length of segments within topologically defined segment categories, and the mean length of segments in each category. A main effect of ethanol was expressed as a significant increase in cumulative length within one category of terminal segments. This increase was the result of a significant increase in mean length/segment in that category. Metric changes in other segment categories were not significant, showing that changes in the networks during ethanol treatment were not distributed randomly. Recovery after ethanol treatment was associated with further nonrandom remodeling of these networks. Significant differences in lengths of terminal segments were no longer present, but internal segments in networks of both pair-fed and ethanol-fed rats were significantly longer. Only one category of internal segments showed this change during recovery. The data showed that long term ethanol treatment in old rats, at a time when effects of aging processes were prominent in Purkinje cell networks, was associated with remodeling of those networks through dendritic extension. This effect was interpreted as compensatory growth in surviving networks following ethanol-related neuronal loss and/or damage to the surrounding neuropil. Recovery from dietary treatment produced further internal remodeling of those networks that was not related specifically to ethanol. It could be shown, however, that the restructuring processes that resulted in longer internal segments after dietary recovery were different in the pair-fed and the ethanolfed rats. \nCombination therapy of OK432 and recombinant human interferon alpha A/D on viral myocarditis in mice starting after infection. We investigated the effects of OK432, recombinant human interferon alpha A/D (rIFN alpha A/D) and a combination of these drugs on murine acute myocarditis due to encephalomyocarditis virus. Mice were administered 1 KE of OK432 and 10(4)U/g of rIFN alpha A/D starting 24 hr after viral inoculation for 14 days. The survival rate of mice having the combination therapy was significantly higher than that of untreated mice on day 21 (15 of 20 vs. 6 of 20, P less than .001), whereas the viral titer in the heart, the heart weight/body weight ratio and the scores fo",
