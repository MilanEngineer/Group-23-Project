        "text": "vely, were used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. Mean patient age was 63 years and all but 1 operation was performed for neoplastic disease. Deep venous thrombosis was detected in 5 of 25 patients (20%) with thromboembolic stockings, 3 of 24 (12.5%) with external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and 2 of 25 (8%) with heparin plus dihydroergotamine. There was no difference in blood loss or complications among the groups. Although statistical significance among the treatment groups was not reached in this study, the trend to a decrease in deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli with external sequential pneumatic compression stockings and heparin plus dihydroergotamine, and an absence of an increase in morbidity in these groups supports the use of these modalities to decrease the morbidity and mortality of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. \nWhy don't all heavy snorers have obstructive sleep apnea? Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and heavy snorers without apnea both show intrathoracic suction pressures during sleep that exceed their static upper airway closing pressures. Complete airway occlusion, however, occurs only in the former patient group. We hypothesized that the kinetic properties of the airflow would be different in these two types of patients because of differences in upper airway morphology. The pharyngeal computed tomography (CT) was used to measure the cross-sectional areas of the upper airways in 15 patients with OSA, 25 nonapneic heavy snorers, and 14 control subjects while they were awake. Nocturnal breathing was monitored with the static charge-sensitive bed (SCSB). The patients with OSA had a narrower airspace at the velopharyngeal (VP) level than the controls (p less than 0.01); the nonapneic snorers did not differ from the other groups. At the tongue base (TB) and the hyoid bone (HB) levels there was no difference between the OSA and the control groups, but the nonapneic snorers had narrower airways at both of these levels compared with control subjects (p less than 0.01) and at the hyoid bone level compared with the OSA group (p less than 0.05). The VP/HB ratio was the parameter that best distinguished the patients with OSA from the nonapneic snorers (lower in the OSA group, p less than 0.001). We suggest that airway collapse during sleep is favored by a narrow velopharynx associated with large hypopharynx. Some heavy snorers may not have an oropharyngeal collapse because the peak inspiratory suction pressure could already be damped down at the level of the relatively narrow hypopharyngeal airways. \nInternal mammary artery subclavian vein fistula following internal jugular vein catheterization. A case report and review of the literature. We have recently treated a patient with an arteriovenous fistula that developed after a right internal jugular vein catheterization. The patient was found to have a pulsatile hematoma and a bruit five days after removal of a temporary pacemaker catheter. Digital subtraction arteriography documented a fistula between the right internal mammary artery and subclavian vein. The fistula was surgically repaired via the cervical route. To our knowledge, an arteriovenous fistula between the internal mammary artery and subclavian vein has not been previously described as a complication of a percutaneous internal jugular vein catheterization. \nAnimal model of gluten induced enteropathy in mice. The aim of our experiments was to produce a local T cell mediated immune response to gliadin in the mouse small intestine as a possible animal model of gluten sensitive enteropathy, coeliac disease. BALB/c and BDF1 mice were immunised systemically with gliadin in complete Freund's adjuvant. The jejunal mucosa was challenged by feeding a gluten containing diet, and villus and crypt lengths, crypt cell production rate, and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were determined to assess mucosal cell mediated immunity. In some animals permeability and local immunity were modulated by concurrent intestinal anaphylaxis or a graft versus host reaction. There were no changes in the jejunal mucosa of BALB/c mice fed a gluten containing diet after having been parenterally immunized. When, however, mice were parenterally immunised with gliadin, fed a gluten containing diet, rendered hypersensitive to helminth antigen by infection with the nematode parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, and challenged intravenously to produce intestinal anaphylaxis crypt cell production rate was significantly higher than in ovalbumin immunized controls at 12 days after parasite challenge. Finally, graft versus host reaction was induced in BDF1 mice that had been parenterally immunised with gliadin and were on a gluten containing diet. Two weeks later these mice had significantly longer crypts and a higher crypt cell production rate and intraepithelial lymphocyte count than control, unimmunized mice with graft versus host reaction. We conclude that active immunization with gliadin does not in itself produce intestinal cell mediated immunity to gliadin contained in the diet, or enteropathy. \nAdrenal suppression and growth retardation after injection of periocular capillary hemangioma with corticosteroids. Adrenal suppression and/or growth retardation were noted in two patients after injection of periocular capillary hemangiomas with corticosteroids. Parents should be warned of these two potential complications of intralesional corticosteroid therapy. Baseline and posttreatment adrenal function should be monitored. If iatrogenic adrenal suppression occurs, supplemental systemic corticosteroids may be necessary in situations involving systemic stress such as infection or surgery. \nIdiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins. Nonthrombotic occlusion or stenosis of the mesenteric veins is a rare cause of intestinal ischemia that usually occurs in association with systemic vasculitis. The current report includes four male patients with segmental ischemic colitis caused by idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia in the small mesenteric veins and their intramural branches; neither vasculitis nor arterial involvement were present. Three of the four patients were less than or equal to 38 years of age; the fourth was 67. All four patients were previously healthy and had no history of drug use of any kind. Clinical findings included abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, and colonic strictures discovered by barium enema. The intima of the mesenteric and intestinal mural veins was focally thickened by a marked increase in cells and matrix between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina, whereas the vessel walls external to the thickened intima appeared normal. Histochemistry and immunoreactivity with antibodies to muscle-specific actins (HHF-35) disclosed that the intimal thickening was caused by proliferation of smooth muscle cells in a proteoglycan matrix. All patients recovered completely after segmental resection of the ischemic portion of the colon and had no recurrence of intestinal symptoms on follow-up of up to 7 years. These unusual venous lesions do not appear to have been previously described; their etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. \nTen-year follow-up of patients with secondary amenorrhea and normal prolactin. A group of 46 patients with secondary amenorrhea without galactorrhea or hyperprolactinemia were studied retrospectively after being clinically categorized into four groups with the use of progesterone-induced uterine bleeding and measurement of serum gonadotropins and prolactin levels. The ability to have regular spontaneous menstrual cycles and to conceive was assessed after a follow-up period of 10 years. Patients who had been classified as having hypothalamic pituitary \"failure\" (hypoestrogenic amenorrhea) with low levels of circulating estradiol had a greater rate of recovery of spontaneous ovulation and menses when compared with patients who had been classified as having only hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction (euestrogenic amenorrhea). The patients with diagnosis of hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation or polycystic ovary syndrome generally required clomiphene citrate for induction of ovulation and almost all the patients with premature ovarian failure (hypergonadotropic amenorrhea) remained estrogen-deficient and unable to ovulate. Hyperprolactinemia or an identifiable pituitary adenoma has not developed in any of the patients to date. \nCould recurrent cholangitis after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy be explained by motor intestinal anomalies? A manometric study. The aim of this study was to describe the motor patterns found in two patients with recurrent cholangitis episodes after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. In one patient, cholangitis was due to a stenosis of the anastomosis between the limb and the left intrahepatic bile duct, while motility of the limb, duodenum, and distal jejunum was normal. In the second patient, no anatomical explanation was found for cholangitis attacks. However, although the duodenal motor activity was normal, the motility of the limb and of the jejunum below the jejunojejunal anastomosis was grossly abnormal: permanent minute rhythm, phase IIIs absent or rare and slowly propagated, all motor abnormalities that could promote bacterial overgrowth in the limb. This stresses the interest in performing motor studies of the Roux-limb when cholangitis remains unexplained after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. \nTissue eosinophilia and eosinophil degranulation in orbital pseudotumor. To investigate the participation of the eosinophil in orbital pseudotumor, the authors studied surgical biopsy specimens from nine patients with pseudotumor. Surgical biopsy specimens of orbital tissue from four patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy and autopsy specimens of orbital tissue from six patients without orbital diseases served as controls. Eosinophil infiltration and degranulation were assessed by immunofluorescence staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues for the cytotoxic eosinophil granule major basic protein. Eosinophil infiltration and extracellular major basic protein deposition were evident in all orbital pseudotumor specimens. In contrast, no eosinophil infiltration or extracellular major basic protein deposition was present in any of the ten control specimens. These findings indicate that eosinophil degranulation is found in orbital pseudotumor, and they also identify yet another clinical entity where eosinophil infiltration and degranulation are associated with fibrosis. \nArteriovenous fistulas complicating biopsy of renal allografts: treatment of bleeding with superselective embolization. The use of superselective embolization was assessed as a treatment for bleeding from postbiopsy arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) in renal transplants. AVFs commonly occur after biopsy procedures in renal transplants, but severe bleeding is rare. Transcatheter embolization can be used to control bleeding, but unless it is sufficiently selective, the procedure results in loss of significant amounts of renal parenchyma. During a 4-year period, embolization procedures were attempted in seven patients 30-65 years old. All had AVFs shown on arteriography. Five patients underwent embolization; occlusion occurred only in the branch supplying the AVF. In one patient with three large AVFs, two were found to have occluded the day after embolization was attempted. In another, an AVF occluded when superselective catheter position was achieved but before embolization. Catheter manipulation in these cases may have precipitated occlusion. In five cases, coaxial embolization techniques were used. Embolization materials consisted of coils in three cases: 0.038 in. (0.97 mm) in one case, 0.025 in. (0.64 mm) in one case, 0.018 in. (0.46 mm) in one case; 0.038 in. (0.97 mm) coils and gelatin foam particles in one case; and localized contrast extravasation in one case. Serum creatinine level was measured before and after embolization in all patients, and radionuclide studies were undertaken in three cases. In all patients, bleeding was effectively controlled. None of the patients showed an increase in serum creatinine level after embolization, and in four, significant improvement was seen. Nuclear medicine studies showed no loss of renal function and a dramatic improvement in one patient. No complications due to the procedure were seen. Our experience suggests that superselective embolization with coaxial catheter techniques is an effective method of treating bleeding from postbiopsy AVFs in renal transplants with minimal loss of renal parenchyma. \nEffect of preexisting brain ischemia on sympathetic nerve response to intracranial hypertension. The performance of the sympathetic nervous system during sustained moderate cerebral ischemia (CI) was examined in the present study. For this purpose, a Cushing response was elicited repeatedly during incomplete global CI in anesthetized artificially ventilated cats after vagotomy and baroreceptor denervation. In control animals without CI, sympathetic activity in response to brief elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) showed a well-repeatable two-phase reaction. During CI there was a progressive deterioration of background sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) over a period of 30 min. SND response to repeated elevation of ICP was initially similar to control response but later with progression of CI was seriously changed. 1) Instead of the usual hyperactivation, sympathetic nerve activity was depressed during intracranial hypertension. 2) The characteristic desynchronized activity either appeared later during the reperfusion period or remained absent. The progressive loss of SND response to raised ICP in developed CI was compared with the changes seen in experiments in which repeated ICP elevations were superimposed on asphyxia. These findings suggest that the sympathetic component of the Cushing reaction strongly depends on the actual state of brain stem autonomic circuits and may be seriously altered in pathological situations involving ischemic brain injury. \nFree magnesium levels in normal human brain and brain tumors: 31P chemical-shift imaging measurements at 1.5 T. We have studied a series of normal subjects and patients with brain tumors, by using 31P three-dimensional chemical shift imaging to obtain localized 31P spectra of the brain. A significant proportion of brain cytosolic ATP in normal brain is not complexed to Mg2+, as indicated by the chemical shift delta of the beta-P resonance of ATP. The ATP beta-P resonance position in brain thus is sensitive to changes in intracellular free Mg2+ concentration and in the proportion of ATP complexed with Mg because this shift lies on the rising portion of the delta vs. Mg2+ titration curve for ATP. We have measured the ATP beta-P shift and compared intracellular free Mg2+ concentration and fractions of free ATP for normal individuals (n = 6) and a limited series of patients with brain tumors (n = 5). In four of the five spectra obtained from brain tissue containing a substantial proportion of tumor, intracellular free Mg2+ was increased, and the fraction of free ATP was decreased, compared with normal brain. \nOtolaryngologic manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux. The exact incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is unknown, although it is estimated that at least 25% of patients with GER have head and neck symptoms alone. These symptoms may consist of one or more of the following: excess salivation, hoarseness, \"post-nasal drip,\" voice change, persistent coughing, food sticking in the throat, globus hystericus, otalgia, throat clearing, neck pain, sore throats, the sensation of a lump in the throat, choking spells, and bronchospasm. Carcinoma of the larynx and upper aerodigestive tract may be a consequence of chronic reflux. GER, especially when the classic symptoms of reflux are absent, is frequently overlooked as a cause of these problems. This article reviews the symptoms and pathophysiology of these conditions. The diagnostic and therapeutic modalities available to us in managing these patients are also discussed. \nThe current status of maternal and fetal blood flow velocimetry. Significant progress has been achieved in regard to normative data for uteroplacental and fetal blood flow velocity and the factors which may affect these observations. Associations have been demonstrated between abnormal indices of maternal and fetal blood flow velocity and pregnancy-induced hypertension, fetal growth retardation, fetal blood gas measures, and intrapartum clinical fetal distress. However, in general, the predictive power is modest and no evidence has yet been provided to indicate that these measures can be used as a screening test in the general obstetric population. Continuing research is highly desirable. At the present time, the use of Doppler assessment of blood flow in pregnancy should be limited to the investigational setting. \nCentral retinal vein occlusion associated with drusen of the optic disc. A 43-year-old man had gradual visual changes OD. Funduscopic examination revealed central retinal vein occlusion OD. Complete ocular examination revealed bilateral drusen of the optic disc, confirmed by b-scan ultrasonography. Complete systemic evaluation showed no other etiology for the central retinal vein occlusion. Over a ten-year follow-up, in the absence of systemic disease or other local ocular anomalies, we concluded that central retinal vein occlusion can arise from external compression secondary to drusen of the optic disc. \nCongenital sideroblastic anaemia in two girls. Transfusion dependent congenital sideroblastic anaemia occurred in infancy in two unrelated girls. One girl developed early organ failure which was not prevented by standard chelation treatment. The combination of modest iron burden and putative intrinsic mitochondrial dysfunction could have accounted for the clinical picture. The other girl remained well, receiving regular transfusion and standard chelation treatment. She had normal liver function and no other evidence of organ damage. The syndrome is unlikely to be due to extreme lyonisation in carriers of the usual X-linked condition. The contrasting clinical patterns seen in these two patients suggest that transfusion dependent congenital sideroblastic anaemia may comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders. It is suggested that such children be carefully monitored for evidence of increasing iron overload so that organ damage can be prevented. \nNovel therapy for the treatment of human carcinoid. Development of effective treatment for patients with carcinoid tumors has been hampered by lack of an experimental model. The authors have established the only long-term cell line of a functioning human pancreatic carcinoid tumor (BON) that produces tumors in nude mice. In this study the authors examined the effect of three agents, alpha-interferon (IFN), a somatostatin analog, SMS 201-995 (SMS), and an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), on the growth of BON tumors. BON was implanted bilaterally as 3-mm2 pieces (subcutaneously [sc]) into male BALB/c nude mice. In the first study, 23 mice were randomized to four groups: control, IFN (1 x 10(6) units, sc, four times a day), IFN + SMS (300 micrograms/kg, intraperitoneally, three times a day), and IFN + 3% DFMO in drinking water. Treatments were initiated on day of tumor implantation. In the second study, mice were randomized to six groups: control, IFN, SMS, DFMO, IFN + SMS, IFN + DFMO, and IFN + SMS + DFMO. Treatments were started on day 15 after tumor implantation. Tumor area and body weights were measured weekly. In both studies mice were killed on day 28 after BON implantation and tumors removed, weighed, and analyzed for DNA and RNA content. In the first study, IFN either alone or in combination with SMS or DFMO suppressed BON tumor growth. When treatment was initiated after established tumor growth (study 2), however, the only effective treatments for suppression of growth of BON were IFN + DFMO and IFN + DFMO + SMS. \nMagnetic resonance imaging of human spinal cord infarction. Magnetic resonance images obtained in two cases of spinal cord infarction are described: one with hemorrhagic thoracic cord infarct, the other with ischemic cervical cord infarct with sequential magnetic resonance imagings. An enlarged cord with strand-shape or longitudinal hypointensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images was noticed in the hemorrhagic infarct; hypointensity on the T2-weighted image was thought to be due to hemosiderin, which shortens T2 relaxation. In the ischemic infarct, a small, round area of hypointensity on T1-weighted images, and of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, noted 9 hours postictus (\"early infarct\") changed on the 22nd day to a cephalocaudal strandlike hypointensity on T1-weighted image, which was enhanced by Gd-DTPA. The hypointensity suggested \"pencil-like softening\" in \"medium\" age infarct. On postictal day 49, it showed an extensive homogeneous hypointensity involving several segments of the cord on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images with negative Gd-DTPA enhancement suggesting \"late transverse infarct.\" We considered that these changes are of value in diagnosing spinal cord infarcts on magnetic resonance imagings. \nHigh rate of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with esophageal varices and idiopathic portal hypertension. Data on 126 consecutive patients who were admitted to our clinics from January 1979 to May 1989 were scrutinized to assess changes in portal hemodynamics following splenectomy. Two groups were classified: (1) a group of 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and (2) a group of 20 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH). Portal thrombosis was present in five (25.0%) of the 20 patients with IPH and in two (1.8%) of the 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. As seen on celiac arteriography, the mean (+/- SD) diameter of the trunk of the splenic artery and vein was 8.99 +/- 1.55 and 16.2 +/- 3.6 mm, respectively, in patients with IPH, while it was 7.94 +/- 1.28 and 14.2 +/- 3.1 mm, respectively, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Changes in portal venous pressure were 78.4 +/- 59.4 mm H2O in patients with IPH and 43.5 +/- 38.7 mm H2O in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. There were no significant differences in the maximum level of thrombocytes in patients with IPH or in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver. These events suggest that portal thrombosis can occur with a significantly higher incidence in patients with IPH than in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver after splenectomy, and a decrease in blood flow in the portal vein may be closely linked to the formation of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with IPH. Preoperative examination of portal hemodynamics must be thorough. \nStress-induced gastroduodenal lesions and total parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients: frequency, complications, and the value of prophylactic treatment. A prospective, randomized study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency, complications, and value of prophylactic treatment of stress-induced gastroduodenal lesions. DESIGNS: Patients were prospectively randomized to treatment with total parenteral nutrition, either alone, with sucralfate, or with ranitidine. SETTING: A multidisciplinary ICU from a tertiary care referral center. PATIENTS: Ninety-seven patients submitted to prolonged mechanical ventilation, with normal hepatic and renal function, in metabolic stress, and receiving total parenteral nutrition. INTERVENTIONS: On admission, we determined the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and the catabolic index score. We also performed an endoscopic examination on day 3, every 7 days subsequently, and whenever needed. Thirty patients received total parenteral nutrition alone. Twenty-four patients received total parenteral nutrition and sucralfate (1 g by nasogastric tube every 4 hrs). Nineteen patients received total parenteral nutrition and ranitidine (50 mg iv every 6 hrs). MAIN RESULTS: The overall occurrence rate of gastroduodenal mucosal damage was 29.6%. The overall frequency rate for stress ulcerations was 15.6% and was 6.2% for stress hemorrhage. There were no deaths secondary to stress hemorrhage. The difference in the frequency of stress-induced mucosal lesions and stress hemorrhage between the studied groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Additional prophylaxis to total parenteral nutrition in the form of sucralfate and ranitidine to prevent acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not required in this group of ICU patients. \nIntraperitoneal thrombolytic agents in relapsing or persistent peritonitis of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Urokinase or streptokinase was instilled intraperitoneally as an adjunct to the antibiotic therapy in 16 episodes of relapsing or persistent peritonitis in CAPD patients. In eight patients the combination of antibiotics and intraperitoneal thrombolytic agents resulted in clearing of the infection with no recurrences. The treatment failed in eight other patients, who had their peritoneal catheters removed. Six of the last eight patients had either abdominal wall abscesses or persistence of the bacteria on the wall of the peritoneal catheter. Elevated post-intraperitoneal instillation peritoneal fluid neutrophil counts and positive post-instillation peritoneal fluid cultures predicted failure of the intraperitoneal instillation of thrombolytic agents in most instances. Intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase may help cure approximately 50% of the episodes of relapsing for persistent peritonitis. Post-instillation peritoneal fluid cell counts and cultures should be monitored. Radiologic investigation for abdominal wall or intraabdominal abscesses is indicated if intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase fails to eradicate peritonitis. \nExpression of c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos proto-oncogenes in human primary melanocytes and metastatic melanomas. Analysis of the regulation of c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcript expression was performed in human primary melanocytes and metastatic melanoma cell strains. The medium requirements for human melanocyte in vitro growth are phorbol esters, agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels, hormones, and growth factors. Cellular jun, jun-B, and c-fos gene expression are known to be affected by growth promoting agents. In primary melanocytes, the expression of c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcripts was dependent on the growth-promoting agents present in the medium. Uniformly high c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcript levels were observed in melanocytes cultivated in complete medium. Higher levels of c-jun RNA transcripts and low levels of c-fos RNA transcripts were observed in melanocytes cultivated in plain medium. In contrast, a range of c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos RNA transcript levels was detected in metastatic melanoma cell strains cultivated in medium with or without serum. In general, an increase in jun-B and c-fos RNA transcript expression and a decrease in c-jun RNA transcript expression was observed in metastatic melanomas compared to neonatal melanocytes. These data suggest a potential role for c-jun, jun-B, and c-fos genes in the transformation of melanocytes to malignant melanoma. \nPain characterization in cancer patients and the analgetic response to epidural morphine. In 48 patients with pain related to malignancy, a pain characterization was performed during oral opioid therapy. After an optimal epidural morphine regimen had been established, the alteration in pain relief was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale. The CSF and plasma morphine concentrations at minimum steady state were then analysed in 28 patients and related to the degree of pain relief. The efficacy of the spinal treatment ranked in the following order: somatic greater than visceral greater than radiating = 0, but the difference was only significant between the somatic and radiating pain groups. There was a tendency for continuous pain to be better relieved than intermittent pain. No correlations were found between the CSF or plasma morphine concentrations and the degree of pain relief, suggesting that not all pain impulses are modulated in a dose-dependent manner by morphine at the spinal level. Pain characterization may be instrumental in providing an optimal spinal opioid analgesia in malignancy. Moreover, there is a need for better defined diagnostic criteria for clinical pain characterization. \nDiagnosis of genetic disease by primer-specified restriction map modification, with application to cystic fibrosis and retinitis pigmentosa Detection of small alterations or abnormalities in genomic DNA (eg, point mutations or small deletions) has become increasingly important in the diagnosis of genetic disease and polymorphism. When a mutation or polymorphism creates a new restriction endonuclease site, it can easily be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the DNA region of interest, followed by digestion with the restriction endonuclease. However, useful restriction sites are the exception, and a variety of specialised techniques have been developed to identify subtle DNA abnormalities. We have shown that where a DNA mutation does not create a useful novel restriction site, such a site can be introduced by PCR and specially chosen primers. The approach is simple and inexpensive and should be broadly applicable in the diagnosis of genetic polymorphism and mutation. The technique is illustrated here by the three base-pair deletion responsible for most cases of cystic fibrosis and by detection of the point mutation in the rhodopsin gene that has been associated with some cases of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. \nPercutaneous mitral valvuloplasty following surgical repair of sinus venosus atrial septal defect. Mitral valvuloplasty performed 5 y after repair of a sinus venosus ASD was difficult because of a thickened septum, but resulted in improved mitral valve opening and did not lead to ASD. Thus, prior repair of a sinus venosus ASD may not be an absolute contraindication to mitral valvuloplasty. \nValue of quantitative nucleolar features in the preoperative cytological diagnosis of follicular neoplasias of the thyroid. Nucleolar prevalence, size, and outline were investigated on cytological material from cold thyroid nodules obtained by fine needle aspiration. The percentage of nucleolated nuclei in follicular adenoma (32 cases) was less than in follicular carcinoma (26 cases). In adenoma most nuclei contained one nucleolus, and nuclei with two or more nucleoli were less common than in carcinoma where most cases showed the highest nucleolar diameter values. There was some overlap between adenomas and carcinomas, however, when the mean of the 10 largest values of the major nucleolar diameter was considered. In follicular carcinoma the percentage of marginated nucleoli--that is, those touching the nuclear membrane--was, in general, greater than 20%; in adenoma the values were equal to or lower than 16%. The overlap index showed that the percentages of marginated nucleoli and nucleolated nuclei are the two best discriminatory features between adenoma and carcinoma. \nExperimental arterial thrombosis in nonhuman primates. The baboon offers many advantages as an experimental animal to study vascular disease, thrombus formation and dissolution, effects of mediating variables, and the relative efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Each specific application for testing therapeutic agents may require testing in somewhat different model systems. For example, although the arteriovenous vascular graft model is efficient, cost effective, and well adapted to study of interventions for acute arterial thrombosis, surgical endarterectomy extends the evaluation to include interactions with the injured vascular wall. As the antithrombotic products of genetic engineering and molecular biology emerge, it will be increasingly important to have relevant, reproducible, and quantitative approaches to evaluate their effects in vivo. \nRespiratory-related recruitment of the masseter: response to hypercapnia and loading. To test the hypothesis that a muscle that closes the jaw, the masseter, can be recruited by ventilatory stimuli, we studied the electromyographic activation of the masseter and genioglossus in seven normal awake males who were exposed in random order to progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia, inspiratory threshold loading (-40 cmH2O), and combined hypercapnia and loading. With hypercapnia, the masseter was generally recruited after the genioglossus had been activated. Once recruited, activation of both muscles increased linearly with increasing CO2. Combined hypercapnia and loading produced more activation than either stimulus alone. These data indicate that the masseter is activated by ventilatory stimuli that activate the genioglossus. Earlier recruitment of the genioglossus suggests that activation of the masseter serves to stabilize the mandible and allow the genioglossus to function as a more efficient dilator of the upper airway. \nAcute pandysautonomic neuropathy. Acute pandysautonomic neuropathy is characterized by severe postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction, with relative or complete sparing of motor and sensory function. Of four reported cases with sural nerve biopsies, two were normal and two abnormal, revealing loss of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. We present a patient with pandysautonomic neuropathy and elevated CSF protein whose sural nerve biopsy showed active axonal degeneration. \nAseptic meningitis following cardiac transplantation: clinical characteristics and relationship to immunosuppressive regimen. Neurologic disorders are uncommon but alarming complications of cardiac transplantation. Of 29 patients from the Utah Cardiac Transplant Program (UCTP) who had lumbar puncture because of change in neurologic function, or to assess fever of uncertain etiology, CSF pleocytosis was present in 14 patients, 4 of whom had an active infectious process involving the nervous system. In 10 other patients, CSF pleocytosis with negative cultures appeared following treatment with OKT3 monoclonal antibody. The most prominent clinical signs of this aseptic meningitis syndrome are fever and transient cognitive dysfunction. \nExtubation after transsternal thymectomy for myasthenia gravis: a prospective analysis. Recommendations concerning postoperative extubation after thymectomy for myasthenia gravis are presently based upon retrospective chart reviews. We present the results of a prospective investigation of time to extubation after thymectomy for 14 patients over a 12-month period based upon a protocol that included preoperative immunologic therapy, combined epidural and general anesthesia, postoperative epidural narcotic analgesia, and a standardized approach to discontinuation of ventilatory support. After a neurologist took measures to optimize preoperative neuromuscular function, all 14 patients received agents to produce lumbar epidural anesthesia and light general anesthesia. Muscle relaxants were avoided in all but one patient. Postoperative analgesia was initially maintained with epidural hydromorphone, then therapy was switched to patient-controlled intravenous morphine sulfate. Criteria for weaning from mechanical ventilation, first measured at the end of anesthesia, were partial pressure of oxygen (arterial) greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.40), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (arterial) less than or equal to 50 mm Hg, pH greater than or equal to 7.30, and respiratory rate less than or equal to 30 breaths/min. If these criteria were not met, ventilatory support was continued postoperatively with intermittent mandatory ventilation, and the patient was weaned gradually from this support. Criteria for extubation included meeting the criteria for weaning, vital capacity greater than or equal to 10 mL/kg, and inspiratory pressure better than -30 cm H2O. Criteria for reintubation included tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 40 breaths/min), respiratory acidosis not due to narcotics, or vital capacity less than or equal to 8 mL/kg. The mean time to extubation was 9 hours (range, 0.75 to 25 hours). Mean preoperative vital capacity was 2.59 +/- 0.64 L (range, 1.90 to 4.20), which decreased approximately 50% to 1.19 +/- 0.39 L (range, 0.70 to 2.0) at the time of extubation. No patient required reintubation. Half of the patients required postoperative anticholinesterase therapy based upon serial neurologic examinations; there were no instances of cholinergic crisis. Thirteen patients returned to the ward on the first postoperative day, and one on the second day. Thirteen patients preferred epidural analgesia to patient-controlled analgesia. The time to extubation and average length of stay in an intensive care setting were markedly reduced compared to those reported in previous retrospective studies. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach that optimizes neuromuscular function and decreases poststernotomy pulmonary insult will shorten the time to extubation and decrease the length of stay in the intensive care or recovery room after thymectomy. \nThe use of potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser for laparoscopic removal of ovarian endometrioma. From January 1989 through January 1990, 31 patients thought to have ovarian endometrioma at ultrasonography were treated by operative laparoscopy and potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser. The endometriomas ranged from 2 to 9.2 cm in diameter by preoperative transvaginal ultrasonography. The operative procedure used was a three-puncture technique with a 600 micron fiber attached to a potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser. The power setting was 10 W with a continuous pulse. In all cases endometriomas were opened, drained, and irrigated, and the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser was used to vaporize or remove the entire cyst lining. The ovarian edges were inverted with the laser at the end of the procedure. With one exception, there was no recurrence of endometrioma at 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure, on the basis of transvaginal ultrasonography or laparoscopy. In one case, 4 months after the initial laparoscopic procedure, exploratory laparotomy was performed for resection of a large, recurrent endometrioma. The use of the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser allows the laparoscopic surgeon an aggressive approach to ovarian endometriomas that in the past necessitated exploratory laparotomy. \nLocalization and needle aspiration of breast lesions: complications in 370 cases. A prospective study of the immediate complications of 370 consecutive breast-imaging procedures (203 wire localizations and 167 radiographically or sonographically guided fine-needle aspirations) is reported. Vasovagal reactions occurred in 27 (7%) of 370 cases, ranging in severity from syncope (four of 370, 1%) to mild light-headedness. These vasovagal reactions were independent of procedure type or use of local anesthesia, but were more common in younger patients. Other complications included prolonged (5 min or longer) bleeding (three of 370, 1%) and extreme pain (two of 370, 1%). One patient was found to have malignant hypertension. We conclude that wire localizations and imaging-guided aspirations are generally well tolerated procedures. However, vasovagal reactions are frequent enough to warrant close observation of patients. Radiologists and breast-imaging personnel should be able to recognize and treat vasovagal reactions. \nOccult pontine glioma in a patient with hemifacial spasm. Hemifacial spasm due to an intracranial mass lesion is rare. We describe a 29-year-old man with hemifacial spasm successfully treated with botulinum A toxin injections for 2 years. The development of acquired diplopia secondary to acquired sixth cranial nerve palsy prompted investigation. Computed tomography done at the time of original diagnosis and on three other occasions (concentrating on the brain stem and cerebellopontine angle) failed to demonstrate an intracranial mass lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large mass lesion in the pons presumed to be a glioma. Patients with hemifacial spasm who have atypical features, especially those with associated neurologic findings, should be screened for tumours. Our case illustrates the superiority of MRI in demonstrating pontine gliomas causing hemifacial spasm. \nImaging of myocardial infarction in dogs and humans using monoclonal antibodies specific for human myosin heavy chains. The use of three different monoclonal antibodies specific for human ventricular myosin heavy chains in the visualization of the location and extent of necrosis in dogs with experimental acute myocardial infarction and in humans is described. Using a classic immunohistochemical method or ex vivo analysis of heart slices in dogs with acute myocardial infarction subjected to intravenous injection of unlabeled antimyosin antibodies or antimyosin antibodies labeled with indium-111, it was observed that all antibody fragments specifically reached the targeted necrotic zone less than 2 h after antibody injection and remained bound for up to 24 h. In a limited but significant number of cases (5 of the 12 humans and 11 of 43 dogs), it was possible to image the necrotic zone in vivo as early as 2 to 4 h after antibody injection. In other cases, individual blood clearance variations retarded or even prevented in vivo necrosis detection. Higher antimyosin fixation values were obtained in the necrotic zones in dogs with a rapid blood clearance relative to that of the other dogs. It is concluded that antimyosin antibodies always reached necrotic areas within 2 h. If blood clearance was rapid, in vivo imaging of the necrotic area was possible 2 to 6 h after necrosis, even in humans. In some cases, however, uncontrolled individual variations in the timing required for sufficient blood clearance hampered this rapid in vivo detection of myocardial necrosis. \nPrimary vesicoureteric reflux: treatment with subureteric injection of Polytef paste. A series of 34 children with 40 primary refluxing ureters were treated endoscopically with a subureteric injection of polytetrafluoroethylene paste (Polytef). The amount injected ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 ml (mean 0.3). A single injection cured the reflux in 26 ureters (65%) and the grade of reflux improved in a further 9 ureters. Seven ureters required a second injection and reflux was cured in 6 of these. The overall cure rate was therefore 80% after the second injection. There was one complication due to self-limiting ureteric obstruction following injection. The procedure is quick, easy to perform and effective. We have some reservations about the long-term efficiency and safety of subureteric Polytef injection in children. \nSerum biomarkers in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. To identify possible clinically valuable markers of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, we measured the serum concentrations of several commercially available biomarkers in 117 patients with this disease. The alpha-fetoprotein level was measured in 75 patients and was elevated in 8 (11%); elevation did not correlate with the presence of liver metastasis. Beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin levels increased in 8 of 83 patients tested (10%). C-terminal parathyroid hormone levels were measured in 79 patients and were elevated in 15 (19%); their serum creatinine level was normal. Thirteen of this group had normal serum calcium levels, whereas 7 patients with hypercalcemia and no clinically evident bone metastasis had normal parathyroid hormone levels. In only 2 of 72 patients, serum lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzyme 1 were elevated. Only 1 of 85 patients had mildly elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen, in contrast to 3 of 7 patients with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis who had moderately elevated carcinoembryonic antigen. Elevations in alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and parathyroid hormone correlated with the course of the disease in 13 patients for whom follow-up measurements were available; measurement of these markers, however, is only useful in a small proportion of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. \nBladder instillations of trisdine compared with catheter introducer for reduction of bacteriuria during intermittent catheterisation of patients with acute spinal cord trauma. An open, prospective, randomised trial was conducted to compare the incidence of significant bacteriuria following 2 methods of intermittent urethral catheterisation in patients with acute spinal cord trauma. Twenty-two patients were catheterised with a Nelaton catheter and 50 ml of Trisdine were instilled into the bladder and left there immediately prior to withdrawal of the catheter. Fifteen patients were catheterised with a Nelaton catheter with a special introducer to improve asepsis (O'Neil catheter). The mean incidence of significant bacteriuria in males and females who received Trisdine bladder instillations was 0.58 and 0.48% per catheterisation respectively; in males and females catheterised with the O'Neil catheter it was 1.16 and 2.93% per catheterisation respectively. The instillation of Trisdine into the bladder after each passage of a catheter resulted in a significantly lower incidence of bacteriuria compared with that which resulted from the use of the O'Neil catheter. The former method is therefore to be preferred for aseptic intermittent urethral catheterisation in patients with acute spinal cord trauma. \nBio-medicus ventricular assist device for salvage of cardiac surgical patients Over a 5-year period, 41 (1%) of 4,193 patients undergoing cardiac operations underwent intraoperative or early postoperative insertion of a Bio-Medicus ventricular assist device when it became apparent that the patient could not otherwise survive. Fourteen patients were in cardiogenic shock and 7 were in cardiac arrest at the time of initiation of their primary cardiac surgical procedure, and in no instance was the device planned as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Bleeding, sepsis, and thromboembolism were frequent postoperative complications. Central nervous system deficits were observed in 16 patients during their postoperative course. Eight patients (19.5%) were long-term survivors. Of the preoperative risk factors evaluated only age was significantly associated with survival, with 7 (33%) of the 21 younger (39 to 63 years) patients surviving. Blood product usage and hospital cost were analyzed in an attempt to assess cost/effectiveness of use of this device for attempted salvage of such desperately ill patients. \nEstimation of Doppler gradients at rest and during exercise in patients with recoarctation of the aorta. In patients with suspected recoarctation of the aorta the estimation of the pressure difference between the arms and legs is an important part of the examination. Because this difference is often augmented when the circulation is stressed by exercise, exercise tests are a useful part of the evaluation. Doppler echocardiography was used to estimate this pressure difference in 16 adult patients in whom simultaneous pressure and Doppler recordings were made both at rest and during exercise. There was a close correlation between the invasive peak instantaneous gradient and the Doppler gradient both at rest and during exercise. There was only a moderate correlation between the invasive peak to peak gradient and the Doppler gradient at rest and during exercise. Doppler echocardiography is recommended as an easy and accurate method of estimating the peak instantaneous gradient both at rest and during exercise in patients with suspected recoarctation. \nStimulation of protein, RNA, and nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes after abdominal surgery is not affected by postoperative amino acid supply. The effects of abdominal surgery on protein, RNA, and de novo purine nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes, and modification of these changes by postoperative amino acid supply, were investigated in 24 patients undergoing cholecystectomy (n = 12) or removal of gastric cancer (n = 12). Mono-nuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral venous blood and incubated with radioactive tracers in vitro. Protein and RNA synthesis, as measured using [14C] glycine and [3H]uridine, respectively, increased postoperatively. Nucleotide synthesis determined by the incorporation of radioactivity from [14C] glycine into nucleotides increased simultaneously. The concentration of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) estimated by the incorporation of [14C]adenine into nucleotides also increased. These changes were greater and of longer duration in patients with cancer operation than in those with cholecystectomy. In neither case were they affected by the amount of amino acid intake, or increases in energy intake. These results suggest that abdominal surgery stimulates protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis in lymphocytes. Increased RNA synthesis may be ensured by increased synthesis of nucleotides, and increased PRPP concentrations appear to regulate the rate of nucleotide synthesis. The responses are apparently dependent upon the severity of surgery, but unrelated to the amount of amino acid supplied postoperatively. \nAminophylline in the outpatient management of decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The objective of this study was to determine if IV aminophylline reduces the risk of relapse after treatment of decompensated COPD in an ED. Forty-six visits in which IV aminophylline was given (T visits) were compared with an equal number of visits in which it was withheld (N visits) with respect to pretreatment serum theophylline level, number of treatments with nebulized bronchodilators and use of parenteral beta-adrenergic drugs, IV corticosteroids and prednisone. The difference in 48-h relapse rates for T and N visits was examined by McNemar's test. No differences were found between T and N visits with respect to vital signs, pretreatment FEV1, arterial blood gas values, hematocrit level or blood leukocyte count. The 48-h relapse rate for T visits (22.2 percent) was significantly higher than for N visits (6.7 percent; p = 0.035). Aminophylline does not appear to be beneficial for outpatients with decompensated COPD and may be harmful. \nReduction of gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse frequency is associated with subsequent selective follicle-stimulating hormone secretion in women with polycystic ovarian disease. Polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and altered gonadotropin secretion. Mean plasma FSH concentrations are low, while LH is elevated in a majority of patients. LH pulsatile secretion has been shown to occur at rapid follicular phase frequencies (approximately one pulse per h) in PCO, suggesting persistent rapid frequency GnRH secretion in this disorder. Anovulatory women with PCO were given estradiol (E2; Estraderm skin patches) and progesterone (P; vaginal suppositories) to produce midluteal concentrations for 21 days. The aim was to determine if E2 and P would slow LH (GnRH) pulse frequency and if this would result in augmented FSH secretion and follicular development after withdrawal of E2 and P. Plasma LH was measured every 10 min for 8 h before, during (days 10 and 20), and 7 days after withdrawal of E2 and P (day 28). On each of these study days FSH was measured hourly, and E2 and P were measured every 2 h. After sampling, GnRH (25 and 250 ng/kg, iv) was given to assess pituitary responsiveness. Follicular development was monitored by vaginal ultrasound through day 34 of the study. Basal LH frequency was 8.5 +/- 0.5 pulses/8 h (mean +/- SEM). During E2 and P, LH pulse frequency fell to 3.3 +/- 1.0 (10 days) and 2.3 +/- 0.8 (20 days), 39% and 27% of the basal value, respectively, and subsequently increased to 5.6 +/- 0.7 (66% of basal) 7 days after withdrawal of E2 and P. LH pulse amplitude (basal, 7.2 +/- 1.5 IU/L) was not reduced until day 20, but remained suppressed (3.9 +/- 1.1 IU/L) on day 28. As a result, mean LH (basal, 21.0 +/- 3.5 IU/L) fell progressively during E2 and P, to 3.8 +/- 1.2 IU/L on day 20, and remained low (39% of basal) 7 days after steroid withdrawal. Mean plasma FSH (basal, 7.1 +/- 0.9 IU/L) also fell during steroid administration, but in contrast to LH, had risen to 93% of the basal value by 7 days after E2 and P. LH release in response to exogenous GnRH revealed marked initial responses which did not decrease until day 20, but remained suppressed (8% of basal) after withdrawal of E2 and P. FSH responses were also suppressed on day 20, but had increased to 75% of the basal value by day 28. Initiation of follicular development occurred in all patients, and the lead follicle measured 12.3 +/- 0.8 mm 13 days post-E2 and P. Ovulation occurred in one patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nCircumspinal decompression for thoracic myelopathy due to combined ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and ligamentum flavum. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) combined with ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) in the thoracic spine can result in serious myelopathy, leading to circumferential compression of the spinal cord in advanced stages of the disease. The authors performed circumspinal decompression (circumferential decompression of the spinal cord) on these patients. This operation consists of two steps: posterior and lateral decompression of the spinal cord by removal of the OLF (first step) and anterior removal of the OPLL for anterior decompression (second step), followed by interbody fusion. In the first step, two deep parallel gutters, covering the extent of the OPLL to be removed anteriorly, are drilled down from the rear into the vertebral body along both sides of the dura to easily and safely remove the OPLL anteriorly at the second step. In the second step, the surgical approach varies according to the affected level; costotransversectomy in the upper thoracic spine and standard thoracotomy in the middle or lower thoracic spine. According to the authors, circumspinal decompression is not an easy procedure, but from their results in 10 patients, they identify it as a radical and promising surgical procedure. \nClinical, laboratory, roentgenographic, and electrocardiographic findings in patients with acute pulmonary embolism and no pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. The history, physical examination, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram and blood gases were evaluated in patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and no history or evidence of pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. The investigation focused upon patients with no previous cardiac or pulmonary disease in order to evaluate the clinical characteristics that were due only to PE. Acute PE was present in 117 patients and PE was excluded in 248 patients. Among the patients with PE, dyspnea or tachypnea (greater than or equal to 20/min) was present in 105 of 117 (90 percent). Dyspnea, hemoptysis, or pleuritic pain was present in 107 of 117 (91 percent). The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood on room air was less than 80 mm Hg in 65 of 88 (74 percent). The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was greater than 20 mm Hg in 76 of 88 (86 percent). The chest radiograph was abnormal in 98 of 117 (84 percent). Atelectasis and/or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were most common, 79 of 117 (68 percent). Nonspecific ST segment or T wave change was the most common electrocardiographic abnormality, in 44 of 89 (49 percent). Dyspnea, tachypnea, or signs of deep venous thrombosis was present in 107 of 117 (91 percent). Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain was present in 113 of 117 (97 percent). Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain was present in 113 of 117 (97 percent). Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain or atelectasis or a parenchymal abnormality on the chest radiograph was present in 115 of 117 (98 percent). In conclusion, among the patients with pulmonary embolism that were identified, only a small percentage did not have these important manifestations or combinations of manifestations. Clinical evaluation, though nonspecific, is of considerable value in the selection of patients in whom there is a need for further diagnostic studies. \nManagement of osteogenic sarcoma in children and adolescents. The management of osteogenic sarcoma in children has made a fantastic step on the survival rate, but there still remains unexpected late metastatic recurrence even in initially good responders to chemotherapy and lower survival rate in the bad responder group. Therefore, the research on etiology and on the understanding and rating of oncologic power of the tumoral cells as well as other kinds of treatment (vaccine, immunotherapy, and other types of chemotherapy) must be increased. The initial function after replacement is good and is often excellent but increasing deterioration is noticed during each follow-up evaluation. A considerable effort is still to be done for bone and joint replacement. Biocompatible material with mechanical strength and resistance to wear will be used for a long time because of the young age of the patients. There must be better use and understanding of the allograft revascularization, as well as a better biologic connection between the bone host and replacement device. This will probably be used in the future with less cement and more of a modular system. The final prognosis will remain for a long time in the perfect cooperation between the various members of the teams (oncologist, surgeon, imager, pathologist, and research team) who treat the patients. \nThe morbidity of long-term seizure monitoring using subdural strip electrodes. The authors report a prospective study of morbidity associated with long-term seizure monitoring using subdural strip electrodes. Three hundred fifty patients were divided into two groups: 175 patients received antibiotics intravenously during the entire period that the electrodes were implanted, and 175 patients received one dose of antibiotics on the morning of surgery. In the group given continuous antibiotic coverage there were two cases of meningitis, both treated without sequelae. In the group receiving one dose of antibiotics, one patient had a brain abscess and three had superficial wound infections. There were no other instances of major morbidity or mortality in either group of patients. The total morbidity rate for both serious and minor complications was 0.85%. \nPredictors of event-free survival after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. BACKGROUND. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was developed as an alternative to aortic-valve replacement in selected elderly patients with aortic stenosis. The use of this procedure is limited, however, by a high incidence of restenosis. METHODS. Between December 1985 and April 1989, valvuloplasty was performed in 205 patients. We evaluated 40 demographic and hemodynamic variables as univariate predictors of event-free survival by Cox regression analysis and identified independent predictors of event-free survival by stepwise multivariate analysis. RESULTS. Early hemodynamic results indicated a decrease in the peak transaortic-valve pressure gradient from 67 +/- 28 to 33 +/- 15 mm Hg after valvuloplasty and an increase in aortic-valve area from 0.6 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.3 cm2 (P less than 0.001 for both comparisons). The rate of event-free survival (defined as survival without recurrent symptoms, repeated valvuloplasty, or aortic-valve replacement) was 18 percent over the mean (+/- SD) follow-up period of 24 +/- 12 months (range, 1 to 47). Significant predictors of event-free survival included the left ventricular ejection fraction and the left ventricular and aortic systolic pressure before valvuloplasty, and the percent reduction in the aortic-valve pressure gradient; the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was inversely associated with event-free survival. Although the predicted event-free survival rate for the entire patient group was 50 percent at one year (95 percent confidence interval, 43 to 57 percent) and 25 percent at two years (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 31 percent), the probability of event-free survival at one year varied between 23 and 65 percent when patients were stratified according to three independent predictors: the aortic systolic pressure, the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure, and the percent reduction in the peak aortic-valve gradient. CONCLUSIONS. The most important predictors of event-free survival after balloon aortic valvuloplasty were related to base-line left ventricular performance. The best long-term results after valvuloplasty were observed among patients who would also have been expected to have excellent long-term results after aortic-valve replacement. \nMicroangiopathy of the brain, retina, and ear: improvement without immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a pregnant young woman with branch retinal arteriolar occlusions, encephalopathy, and hearing loss in whom we demonstrated a patent foramen ovale. She improved while receiving anticoagulants and no immunosuppressive therapy. The microangiopathic syndrome of retinopathy, encephalopathy, and deafness may be due to a disturbance of coagulation and/or microembolism. \nEosinophilic pustular folliculitis. Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis is characterized by the spontaneous development of recurrent, sterile papules, pustules, and plaques on the face, trunk, arms, and occasionally the palms and soles. Although the large majority of the reported cases have occurred in Eastern Asians, most patients in the United States have been infants or men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus. We describe a North American woman with eosinophilic pustular folliculitis who was neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus nor of Asiatic descent. \nDelirium and lactic acidosis caused by ethanol and niacin coingestion. A 44-year-old male presented to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was receiving niacin therapy for hypercholesterolemia, and 16 hours earlier had ingested a large quantity of wine. Past medical history was otherwise unremarkable; physical examination revealed paranoid ideation and asterixis. Laboratory evaluation was significant for metabolic acidosis with a calculated anion gap of 39. Liver enzymes were elevated, and lactic acid level was 9.5 mmol/L (normal: 0.5 to 2.2 mmol/L). White blood cell count was 23,100, but all cultures were negative, and all other diagnostic studies, including bilirubin, prothrombin time, and ammonia were normal. The patient recovered rapidly with hydration and administration of thiamine and magnesium. After psychiatric evaluation, a diagnosis of toxic delirium due to niacin and ethanol coingestion was made. This is the first case reporting toxic delirium and lactic acidosis due to niacin and ethanol coingestion. This occurred in the absence of significant hepatic impairment. Possible mechanisms for the observed derangements are discussed. \nTreatment of bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. Bacterial skin infections occur commonly and range in severity from mild to life threatening. The severity of skin infections, and their management and prognosis, can depend on the mechanism of infection, the skin structures involved and the infecting organism or organisms. Primary skin infections result from invasion of microorganisms through tiny breaks in the epidermis or from the spread of microorganisms through the bloodstream. Secondary infections arise from pre-existing trauma, burns or surgical wounds; infections involving the soft tissues underlying the skin are also discussed. These also frequently occur in areas of trauma, operation or ischemia. The cause, bacteriologic factors and management of skin infections were studied, with special attention to pyodermas, infections of the foot in diabetic patients and necrotizing soft tissue infections. Choice of appropriate antibiotic agents depends in large part on the infecting organism and patterns of antibiotic susceptibility. In necrotizing soft tissue infections, survival or limb salvage may depend on prompt surgical intervention. In these instances and in some of advanced primary skin infections in which bacteremia is involved, parenteral antibiotics are required. The available options are discussed and a report on the data with the combination agent ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium is presented. \nIliac artery stenosis or obstruction after unsuccessful balloon angioplasty: treatment with a self-expandable stent. Obstruction or stenosis of the iliac artery was treated by placement of a self-expandable stent in 91 patients. A total of 100 lesions was treated. All patients had had poor results of balloon angioplasty including residual stenosis, iliac occlusion, and dissection. The stent used in all cases was a self-expandable stainless steel endoprosthesis mounted on a 7- or 9-French catheter and covered by an invaginated tubular rolling membrane. The diameter of the expanded stent varied from 7 to 12 mm. A total of 129 stents was placed. Technical success was 97%. Thromboses occurred immediately after placement in two patients and within the first month in six; these were mainly due to residual obstruction. Eighty-two (93%) of 88 patients with a follow-up longer than 3 months had no recurrent symptoms. Restenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia inside the stent occurred in 10 patients; these required repeated intervention in only four cases. In the remaining six patients, no further complications occurred. Our results show that self-expanding endoprostheses are of value for improving the results of inadequate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. \nPulmonary hypertension and polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase after esophageal cancer operations. To evaluate the role of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) elastase in pulmonary impairment occurring after operation for esophageal cancer, 10 patients were randomized preoperatively into two equal groups. One group received a placebo infusion and the other, an infusion of the PMN elastase inhibitor ulinastatin. In the placebo group, the mean plasma PMN elastase level increased from 154 +/- 23 micrograms/L preoperatively to 449 +/- 56 micrograms/L at 6 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.01), whereas the mean plasma fibronectin concentration decreased from 490 +/- 70 micrograms/mL preoperatively to 265 +/- 81 micrograms/L on postoperative day 2 (p less than 0.01). The mean pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly from 151 +/- 24 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 preoperatively to 284 +/- 76 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 at 6 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.01). In the group given ulinastatin, 150,000 units every 12 hours from the start of the operation, the mean PMN elastase value at 6 hours postoperatively was lower (275 +/- 66 micrograms/L; p less than 0.01) and the fibronectin level on postoperative days 1 and 2, higher (p less than 0.05). A lower pulmonary vascular resistance was noted into day 2 (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that PMN elastase may participate in the development of postoperative pulmonary impairment. \nPlatelet angiotensin II binding sites in normotensive and hypertensive women. Specific binding of angiotensin II (AII) to platelets was measured in 89 women, 25 nulliparous non-pregnant women and 64 primigravida in the third trimester of pregnancy. There was significantly lower binding in the 25 pregnant women who were normotensive (2.3 fmol/10(9) cells) when compared with the non-pregnant women (9.0 fmol/10(9) cells P less than 0.001). Significantly higher platelet AII binding levels were found in the 39 women who had pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) (5.5 fmol/10(9) cells) when compared with the 25 normotensive pregnant women (P less than 0.001). Of the 39 women with PIH, platelet AII binding was higher in the 23 women who had pre-eclampsia (7.0 fmol/10(9) cells), when compared with the 16 who had non-proteinuric PIH, (4.6 fmol/10(9) cells) although the difference was not statistically significant (P less than 0.04). The pressor response to AII is also diminished in pregnancy, yet less so if pregnancy induced hypertension develops. Platelets may provide a readily accessible tissue with which to study AII responsiveness in pregnancy. \nGastrointestinal cytology. Since the development of the fiberoptic endoscope, laboratories have received cytologic specimens obtained from all segments of the gastrointestinal tract in increasing numbers to identify infectious agents and neoplasms. Adenocarcinomas generally are easily diagnosed and distinguished from reparative atypia, but their precursor lesions, dysplasia and adenomas, provide greater interpretive challenges. The same is true for such entities as malignant lymphomas. Most mesenchymal tumors remain outside the diagnostic capabilities of most cytologists. \nModulation of alpha smooth muscle actin and desmin expression in perisinusoidal cells of normal and diseased human livers. It has been suggested that perisinusoidal liver cells (PSC) play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of fibrocontractive changes. Using light and electron microscopic immunolocalization techniques, a series of 207 normal and pathologic human liver specimens were evaluated for the expression of alpha smooth muscle (SM) actin and desmin in this and other nonparenchymal cell types. In normal adult liver tissue, PSCs were practically devoid of desmin and exceptionally stained for alpha-SM actin, whereas this actin isoform frequently was encountered in PSCs from the embryonic to the adolescent period. A broad spectrum of pathologic conditions was accompanied by the presence of alpha-SM actin containing PSCs; these were detected preferentially in periportal or perivenular zones according to the predominant location of the underlying hepatocellular damage. The occurrence of this PSC phenotype generally was associated with fibrogenesis and was in some cases detected earlier than overt collagen accumulation. Fibrous bands subdividing liver tissue in cirrhosis and focal nodular hyperplasia, as well as desmoplastic reaction to malignant tumors, contained alpha-SM actin-rich cells admixed with variable proportions of cells coexpressing desmin. In end stages, this population was less numerous than in active fibrotic or cirrhotic processes. Using immunogold electron microscopy, alpha-SM actin was localized in microfilament bundles of typical PSCs. Our results are compatible with the assumption that the appearance of alpha-SM actin and desmin-expressing myofibroblasts results at least in part from a phenotypic modulation of PSCs. \nBreast cancer screening in a biracial community: the Charleston tricounty experience. Breast cancer remains a major cause of death among women in South Carolina. Mammography, breast self-examination, and clinical breast examination are effective methods for early detection and subsequent mortality reduction. The Tricounty Breast Cancer Screening Survey assessed knowledge of these methods and recommendations among 503 women in the Charleston area. While 57% of all respondents reported performing breast self-examination at least once per month, 13% of blacks and 6% of whites reported that they do not know how to perform the procedure. Clinical breast examinations within the past year were reported by 69%, yet 11% of blacks and 4% of whites reported that they had never had the examination. More than one third (40%) of all 503 women reported ever having had a mammogram, and 22% reported having had one within the past year. However, 18% of the blacks and 5% of whites reported never having heard of the procedure. The major barriers to mammography appear to be the belief that women do not need regular mammograms and the lack of recommendations by their physicians. Survey results support the need for educating women about what the procedures are, the importance of using them regularly, and the means to comply with them. \nSkin test reactivity in patients suffering from lung and breast cancer. Mast cells and histamine-mediated reactions may be altered in patients with cancer. In an attempt to characterize the possible skin defects in patients with cancer, we tested 22 patients suffering from lung cancers, 30 from breast cancers, and 30 age-matched normal individuals, using several compounds, in investigating the pathophysiology of the skin response. Histamine hydrochloride (10 and 100 mg/ml) and codeine phosphate (9%) were tested by prick test. Substance P (50 and 500 ng per injection site), phentolamine (20 micrograms per injection site), and carbachol (1 microgram per injection site) were tested by intradermal skin tests. Skin mast cells were also microscopically examined in 10 patients with lung cancer, five with breast cancer, and 10 normal subjects. The mean wheal sizes induced by all the tested substances were similar in patients with cancer and chronic bronchitis and in normal individuals. The flare to histamine, codeine phosphate, and substance P was completely abolished in 7/22 patients with lung cancer, but the lack of flare was not related to the age of the patients, nor to the staging of cancer, nor to metastasis. The mean numbers of alcian blue-stained or toluidine blue-stained positive mast cells were similar in normal subjects and in subjects with cancer. This study does not confirm the skin hyporeactivity of patients with cancer. \nDecreased fibrinolytic activity and increased platelet function in hypertension. Possible influence of calcium antagonism. Twelve patients with mild hypertension were compared, after 14 days of placebo, with an age- and gender-matched group of 12 healthy volunteers for platelet aggregability and fibrinolytic activity. Following this, 10 of the 12 hypertensives were treated with the calcium antagonist isradipine for 12 months. Blood was drawn for determinations of platelet aggregation and fibrinolytic activity after two weeks and 12 months of treatment. Platelet aggregation tended to increase in the hypertensives compared with controls, indicated by a lowering of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) threshold value for irreversible aggregation. Tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity was significantly decreased in hypertensives compared to controls (P less than .05). During therapy, platelet aggregation decreased and t-PA activity increased (P less than .05). The present data suggest that fibrinolytic activity is decreased and platelet aggregation increased in mild hypertension. Besides the blood pressure-lowering effect, isradipine may protect against thromboembolic diseases by modifying platelet function and fibrinolytic activity. \nHow mothers keep their babies warm. Details of room temperature, clothing, and bedding used by night and by day and in winter and in summer were recorded for 649 babies aged 8 to 26 weeks. Room temperature at night was significantly related to outside temperature and duration of heating. Total insulation was significantly related to outside temperature and to minimum room temperature, but there was wide variation in insulation at the same room temperature. High levels of insulation for a given room temperature were found particularly at night and in winter, and were associated with the use of thick or doubled duvets and with swaddling. At least half the babies threw off some or all of their bedding at night, and at least a quarter sweated. Younger mothers and mothers in the lower social groups put more bedclothes over their babies, and the latter also kept their rooms warmer. Many mothers kept their babies warmer during infections. \nUse of hearing aids by patients with closed mastoid cavity. Twenty-five patients who had undergone a closed-cavity tympanomastoidectomy in our Unit and wore a hearing aid in the operated ear were reviewed, and information was recorded on the use of the aid, and the patients' impression about it. The information obtained was analysed and compared with similar data from 39 hearing aid users of similar age with no history of ear surgery. Eighty per cent of the patients with a closed mastoid cavity were satisfied with the aid, and no significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the impression about the aid (chi square 3.06, p = 0.08), or the problems with it, which, in most of the cases, were related to several changes of mould (chi square 2.19, p = 0.13). The various recorded parameters are discussed, and it is concluded that the patients with a closed mastoid cavity can tolerate a hearing aid in the operated ear at least as well as the control subjects with no ear surgery. \nT-cell receptor delta gene recombination in common acute lymphoblastic leukemia: preferential usage of V delta 2 and frequent involvement of the J alpha cluster. A high frequency (greater than 80%) of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) exhibit a recombination of the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta chain locus. Interestingly, distinct TCR delta elements are preferentially used in immunologic subtypes. In a recent series of 201 children with common ALL (cALL) we observed a TCR delta rearrangement in 162 patients, 57% of the latter showing a hybridization pattern in Southern blots suggestive of a V delta 2 to D delta 3 recombination. To verify this interpretation and to elucidate in more detail the diversity of this common type of TCR delta recombination we amplified and sequenced the junctional region of nine cALL patients and cell line REH-6 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A V delta 2 D delta 3 recombination was confirmed in all cases; convincing evidence for the participation of D delta 1 or D delta 2 elements was not obtained. Eight of nine patients and REH-6 showed complete 5' D delta 3 boundaries within V delta 2 D delta 3 segments, a limitation of junctional diversity also detected in 50% of peripheral blood cell clones derived from two healthy probands. Notably, sequence identity at the V delta 2 D delta 3 junction was demonstrated for a cALL and one of the control clones. Another group of 35 of 162 cALL patients was characterized by V delta 2 rearrangements and biallelic deletion of J delta and C delta sequences. Using a J alpha consensus primer, PCR-directed sequence analysis demonstrated V delta 2 D delta 3 J alpha recombinations in all four cases analyzed by this approach. The J alpha segments of these patients differed, but were identical or homologous to published J alpha elements. Our data suggest a recombination pathway of the TCR delta/alpha locus leading to chimeric TCR alpha molecules, containing V delta and, remarkably, also D delta sequences. \nAntiproliferative effects of cytokines on squamous cell carcinoma. A panel of 12 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) cell lines has been used to determine sensitivity of tumor cells to cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) in vitro. Antiproliferative activity of these cytokines on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck monolayers was measured in a colorimetric MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide]-based assay. All 12 cell lines tested were sensitive to IFN-gamma, with the 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) ranging from 0.07 +/- 0.001 to 104 +/- 4.6 U/mL. The TNF-alpha showed antiproliferative activity on three cell lines at relatively high doses (ID50 from 55 +/- 4.1 to 847.10 +/- 10 U/mL), and IFN-alpha was growth inhibitory in only one line (ID50 = 1211 +/- 46.2 U/mL). The combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha had a synergistic antiproliferative effect on eight cell lines and an additive effect on two cell lines. In two cell lines, the effect of the combination was equal to that of IFN-gamma alone. A combination of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha resulted in cell growth inhibition in six of the seven lines tested, and this effect was synergistic. These in vitro studies indicate that combinations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha or IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha may be more growth inhibitory against squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and at lower doses than each of these cytokines used singly. \nAcid perfusion test and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring with symptom index. Comparison of tests for esophageal acid sensitivity. The acid perfusion (Bernstein) test and esophageal pH monitoring are the two most popular tests for identifying esophageal acid sensitivity in difficult cases of reflux disease. Therefore, we prospectively compared these test results in 75 consecutive noncardiac chest pain patients who had both an acid perfusion test and chest pain during 24-hr pH testing. A positive acid perfusion test was defined by the replication of the patient's typical chest pain twice by the acid infusion. Esophageal pH testing identified abnormal amounts of acid reflux and correlated symptoms with acid reflux--the \"symptom index.\" Fifteen patients (20%) had a positive acid perfusion test while 45 patients (59%) had a positive symptom index (range 6-100%). Only 9/34 (26%) patients with abnormal reflux had a positive acid perfusion test. Although it had excellent specificity (83-94%), the acid perfusion test had poor sensitivity (32-46%) when compared to the symptom index regardless of the percent positive cutoff level. The best positive predictive value for the acid perfusion test was 87%, but this occurred when the test sensitivity was 32%. Modifying the end point of a positive acid perfusion test to include heartburn improves the sensitivity (52-67%) while markedly compromising specificity and positive predictive value. Thus, esophageal pH monitoring correlating symptoms with acid reflux is superior to the acid perfusion test for identifying an acid sensitive esophagus in patients with noncardiac chest pain. \nA randomized trial of alternating chemotherapy versus best supportive care in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. From April 1985 to September 1988, 128 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were enrolled in a prospective randomized trial evaluating chemotherapy (arm A) versus best supportive care (arm B). Chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 IV day 1, and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV day 1 (CE'P regimen) alternating every 4 weeks with methotrexate 30 mg/m2 IV day 1, etoposide 200 mg/m2 IV day 1, and lomustine (CCNU) 70 mg/m2 orally day 1 (MEC' regimen) until progression. Of the 123 patients (62 treated and 61 controls) eligible for survival, 115 were fully evaluable for response (58 treated and 57 controls). Response rates were 21% partial response, 53% stable disease, and 26% progressive disease in arm A, and 47% stable disease and 53% progressive disease in arm B. Median survival was 34.3 weeks (range, 4.3 to 218.6+ weeks) in arm A versus 21.1 weeks (range, 4.3 to 188.6 weeks) in arm B; the difference was not significant at P = .153 (Mantel-Cox). Subgroups of patients retrospectively analyzed by age, performance status, stage M0/M1, and weight loss or not showed no significant difference in survival. Poor-risk patients (at least two of the following: poor performance status, stage M1, weight loss) of arm A survived significantly longer than poor-risk patients of arm B (23.6 weeks v 12.4 weeks, Mantel-Cox P = .008); a significant difference in survival was also observed between nonsquamous cell patients of arm A and those of arm B (median survival, 38.6 weeks v 16.7 weeks; Mantel-Cox P = .041). Toxicity on the chemotherapy arm was hematologic (World Health Organization [WHO] grade greater than 3) in 12% of CE'P and in 13% of MEC' courses and gastroenteric (WHO grade greater than 3) in 24% of CE'P courses and in 8% of MEC' courses. Our alternating treatment was not significantly superior to supportive care. It is likely that certain subgroups of the NSCLC category may have an advantage with chemotherapy. \nEffect of tocotrienols on hepatocarcinogenesis induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene in rats. The effects of tocotrienols on hepatocarcinogenesis in rats fed with 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) were followed morphologically and histologically for a period of 20 wk. No differences between treated and control rats in the morphology and histology of their livers was observed. Cell damage was extensive in the livers of AAF-treated rats but less extensive in the AAF-tocotrienols-treated rats when compared with normal and tocotrienols-treated rats. 2-Acetylaminofluorene significantly increases the activities of both plasma and liver microsomal gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) and liver microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDP-GT). Tocotrienols administered together with AAF significantly decrease the activities of plasma GGT after 12 and 20 wk (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.002, respectively) and liver microsomal UDP-GT after 20 wk (P less than 0.02) when compared with the controls and with rats treated only with tocotrienols. Liver microsomal GGT also showed a similar pattern to liver microsomal UDP-GT but the decrease was not significant. These results suggest that tocotrienols administered to AAF-treated rats reduce the severity of hepatocarcinogenesis. \nEffect of thrombolysis on the evolution of late potentials within 10 days of infarction. Patients with late potentials in the signal averaged electrocardiogram are more at risk of lethal arrhythmias in the period after acute myocardial infarction. To test the effects of thrombolysis on the incidence and evolution of late potentials, 158 consecutive patients were prospectively studied during the first 10 days after acute myocardial infarction. The study population consisted of two groups: 93 control patients treated conservatively and 65 patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Recordings of signal averaged electrocardiogram were obtained within two days and 7-10 days after infarction. The incidence of late potentials in the first two days after infarction was not significantly different in the thrombolytic and control groups (14% v 11.8%). By 7-10 days the incidence of late potentials among patients who underwent thrombolysis remained unchanged (14%); however, it increased significantly in the control group (11.8% to 22.5%). Thus thrombolysis seems to reduce the evolution of late potentials within 10 days of infarction. Because the risk of fatal arrhythmias is higher in patients with late potentials this study may partly explain the reduced mortality after thrombolysis. \nInflammatory pseudotumor of the choroid plexus in Sjogren's disease. We report an unusual case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the choroid plexus of the right lateral ventricle, manifesting as an intraventricular mass and causing unilateral hydrocephalus in a 48-year-old man who suffered from Sjogren's disease and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The lesion obliterated the normal choroidal architecture by a mixed chronic inflammatory process that was associated with reactive connective tissue changes. Immunohistochemical studies showed no light-chain restriction in the cells, and residual islands of transthyretin-positive epithelial cells were identified, implicating the choroid plexus origin of the mass. \nColic medication and apparent life-threatening events. Eight infants with histories of apnea and cyanosis were referred to the Southwest SIDS Research Institute for evaluation of apparent life threatening events (ALTE). All of the infants had been treated for colic with a 1:1 concentration of dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) and phenobarbital, hyoscyamine sulfate, atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide (Donnatal). The medication was pre-mixed by local pharmacists. A comprehensive work-up failed to reveal a cause for the ALTE in any infant. The Dramamine/Donnatal mixture was withdrawn and polygraphic evaluation was conducted. Cardiorespiratory abnormalities were identified in all eight infants and significant gastroesophageal reflux (GER) was documented in four. The possibility that colic medication contributes to cardiorespiratory instability and GER in vulnerable infants requires serious consideration and further evaluation. \nA direct correlation of the resolution of pseudophakic cystoid macular edema with acetazolamide therapy. We report the case of a patient with pseudophakic cystoid macular edema whose visual acuity improved promptly with oral administration of 500 mg of acetazolamide extended-release capsules BID for two weeks. However, vision worsened again within two weeks of discontinuation of the treatment. On resumption of acetazolamide therapy for three weeks, and its slow withdrawal during the following three weeks, the macular edema eventually resolved, and vision returned to normal. Our observation provides a direct correlation of the resolution of pseudophakic cystoid macular edema with acetazolamide therapy and shows the importance of tapering the doses of this regimen. \nPrevalence of migraine in low-tension glaucoma and primary open-angle glaucoma in Japanese. We studied the prevalence of migraine in low-tension glaucoma (LTG) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Seventy seven Japanese patients with LTG, 73 with POAG, and 75 normal subjects were randomly selected and tested with a headache questionnaire. The prevalence of headache with or without typical migrainous features (unilateral headache or ocular pain, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbance before headache) was 51% in LTG, 42% in POAG, and 44% in normal patients. The prevalence of headache with two migrainous features or more (probable migraine) was 17% in LTG, 11% in POAG, and 12% in normal subjects. The prevalence of headache with three migrainous features (classical migraine) was 5% in LTG, 3% in POAG, and 3% in normal subjects. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of any types of migraine between the three groups of patients (p greater than 0.05). These results suggest there is no significant relationship between migraine and LTG or POAG in Japanese patients. \nCervical esophageal motility: evaluation with US in progressive systemic sclerosis. High-resolution ultrasound (US) showed that initial peristalsis propelled ingested soda smoothly and rapidly in 20 volunteers without symptoms who met both manometric and radionuclide esophageal scintigraphic (RES) criteria for normal motility. Twenty-eight patients with progressive systemic sclerosis were classified according to results of RES as follows: group 1, normal esophageal motility (three patients [11%]); group 2, hypomotility of the esophagus, excluding the cervical esophagus (18 patients [64%]); and group 3, hypomotility of the cervical esophagus (seven patients [25%]). In the seven patients of group 3, US demonstrated that an incomplete peristalsis sequence or a feeble peristalsis propelled the soda in a slow and/or to-and-fro motion with low velocities. In the other 21 patients (75%), the soda passed through the esophagus smoothly and rapidly. Retention of soda in the cervical esophagus was not limited to patients with hypomotility of the cervical esophagus. It is concluded that US is useful in evaluation of cervical esophageal motility. \nPretranslational regulation of albumin synthesis in tumor-bearing mice. The role of anorexia and undernutrition. Hepatic albumin synthesis, serum albumin turnover, and hepatic albumin messenger RNA (mRNA) content were evaluated in mice bearing a transplantable low differentiated tumor (MCG 101). Results obtained on tumor-bearing mice were compared with results obtained from non-tumor-bearing animals that were either freely fed, food restricted so that their body composition was similar to tumor-bearing animals (pair-weighed), fed a protein-free diet for 5 days, or fasted for 48 hours. Tumor-bearing animals became hypoalbuminemic (33 +/- 5 vs. 44 +/- 3 g/L in freely fed mice), which could be explained by both depressed albumin synthesis (1.95% +/- 0.20% vs. 2.67% +/- 0.27%/h in freely fed mice) and increased albumin degradation. Pair-weighed and protein-calorie malnourished controls had reductions in albumin synthesis (1.81% +/- 0.18% and 1.67% +/- 0.17%/h, respectively) similar to tumor-bearing animals, and the starved controls had the lowest synthetic rates (1.07% +/- 0.10%/h). Albumin degradation was increased only in tumor-bearing animals. Hepatic albumin mRNA in undernourished animals was less (tumor bearing, 32% +/- 5%; pair weighed, 47% +/- 4%; 48 hours fasted, 18% +/- 2%; and protein-calorie malnourished, 26% +/- 3%) than 50% of the mRNA content in the livers of freely fed control mice. Messenger RNA-directed synthesis of albumin in vitro was also depressed to a variable degree in tumor-bearing and malnourished non-tumor-bearing controls. The hypoalbuminemia in tumor-bearing animals could not be prevented by daily injections of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor (indomethacin, 1 microgram/g body wt), but the hepatic acute phase protein serum amyloid P decreased from 157 +/- 12 to 103 +/- 9 micrograms/mL in indomethacin-treated tumor-bearing mice (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that increased albumin degradation seen in tumor-bearing animals cannot be explained by associated malnutrition, whereas tumor-associated malnutrition can explain to a large extent the depressed albumin synthesis. Decreased albumin synthesis in tumor-bearing animals correlated in part with a decreased quantity of liver albumin mRNA. The results of the current study are consistent with either a reduced transcription of the albumin gene or a change in albumin mRNA processing and stability communicated by anorexia and malnutrition. \nCogan's syndrome complicated by lacunar brain infarcts. Cogan's syndrome, nonsyphilitic interstitial keratitis with vestibuloauditory dysfunction, is an uncommon disease of young adults, probably a manifestation of vasculitis. A 32 year old woman with this syndrome developed a thalamic syndrome with amnesia and dysphasia due to lacunar infarcts. \nImpact of autologous bone marrow infusion on hematopoietic recovery after high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin. Because of potential tumor contamination and inadequacy of current purging technique of bone marrow in patients with solid tumors, we investigated an alternative approach to high-dose therapy without autologous bone marrow (ABM) infusion. Three levels of nonmyeloablative doses of cyclophosphamide 4.5 to 5.25 g/m2, etoposide 750 to 1,200 mg/m2, and cisplatin 120 to 165 mg/m2 (CVP) were administered to patients with metastatic solid tumors. Patients were randomized to ABM (n = 46) or no-ABM (NABM) (n = 46) infusion after CVP to study the impact of ABM on hematopoietic recovery, morbidity, and mortality. All patients had ABM harvested, underwent conventional chemotherapy, and then received CVP. Seventy-three patients received two courses of similar doses. The following were the median days to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.1 x 10(9)/L: for the ABM arm, 19, 21, and 19 and for the NABM arm, 23, 20, and 21 at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively, during course 1 (P = .01, .80, and .01, respectively). During course 2, ANCs to 0.1 x 10(9)/L and 0.5 x 10(9)/L were attained significantly faster at levels 1 and 3 in the ABM arm. ANC to 1.0 x 10(9)/L was comparable in both arms. Incidence of infection and duration of fever were similar in both arms. Although mortality and the incidence of delayed hematopoietic recovery were more frequent in the NABM arm, this was not statistically significant. Platelet recovery was consistently prolonged in course 2 in both arms, with demonstrable benefit of ABM in course 2 when dose levels were collectively considered. We conclude that (1) ABM enhanced recovery of ANC to 0.1 x 10(9)/L; (2) ABM did not decrease the incidence of infections and the duration of fever; and (3) CVP can be safely given without ABM to carefully selected patients. \nPrevalences of endoscopic and histological findings in subjects with and without dyspepsia OBJECTIVE--To examine the association between dyspeptic symptoms and endoscopic and histological diagnoses. DESIGN--Cross sectional study of people with dyspepsia and controls matched for age and sex identified by questionnaire survey of all inhabitants aged 20 to 69. Endoscopy and histological examination was performed with the examiner blind to whether or not the patient had dyspepsia. SETTING--Population based survey in Sorreisa, Norway. SUBJECTS--All people with dyspepsia and age and sex matched people without dyspepsia were offered endoscopy. A total of 309 people with dyspepsia and 310 without dyspepsia underwent endoscopy, giving 273 matched pairs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalences of endoscopic and histological diagnoses made according to internationally accepted standards. RESULTS--In all, 1802 of 2027 (88.9%) people returned the questionnaire. Of the 163 subjects who refused endoscopy, 114 were controls. Of five endoscopic and four histological diagnoses only peptic ulcer disease, endoscopic duodenitis, and active chronic gastritis were diagnosed significantly more often in people with dyspepsia. In all, 30% to 50% of the diagnoses of mucosal inflammation and peptic ulcer disease were made among subjects without dyspepsia, and only 10% of both those with and those without dyspepsia had normal endoscopic findings. CONCLUSIONS--The diagnostic findings, with possible exceptions of peptic ulcer disease and endoscopic duodenitis, showed no association of clinical value with dyspeptic symptoms. The small number of \"normal\" endoscopic findings in both those with and those without dyspepsia challenge well accepted endoscopic and histological diagnostic criteria with relation to the upper gastrointestinal tract. \nTranscription, storage and release of atrial natriuretic factor in the failing human heart. 1. In this study the relationship between the synthesis of atrial natriuretic factor at the level of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA and the atrial storage and circulating plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor were investigated in 15 patients with heart failure. The patients underwent right and left heart catheterization before cardiac surgery for valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting. 2. Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were correlated to atrial levels of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA. Atrial levels of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA and plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor exhibited a close correlation to both pulmonary artery pressure and left atrial pressure. No relationship, however, could be found between the right atrial content of atrial natriuretic factor and both the expression of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA in the atria and the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor. 3. From these data it may be concluded that increased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor in the pressure- and/or volume-overloaded heart are associated with an elevated level of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA. We suggest that not only plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor but also the expression of atrial natriuretic factor in the atrial are related to left ventricular filling pressures in the failing human heart. \nIntracerebral Hodgkin's disease in a human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patient.
