        "text": "elta was not detected in either cell type. In REF52 cells, PLC-gamma was associated with the actin cytoskeleton and was evenly distributed along the length of the actin microfilaments. PLC-gamma was coincident with alpha-PKC at the points where the filaments are anchored to the membrane (i.e., the focal contacts). Cytoskeletal association of PLC-gamma was not transformation sensitive, although the actin cytoskeleton was more disordered in simian virus 40-transformed cells. In REF52 cells, platelet-derived growth factor induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both soluble and cytoskeletal PLC-gamma. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma did not seem to be a determinant of its subcellular localization, but there was a detectable increase in cytoskeleton-associated PLC-gamma in response to platelet-derived growth factor treatment. \nMassive ossifying fibroma of the temporal bone. Ossifying fibromata are rare lesions of the temporal bone. Because the tumors tend to progress and can become clinically massive, early complete resection is advised whenever feasible to prevent clinically evident recurrences and potentially life-threatening complications. \nA simple technique for closure of a palatal fistula using a conchal cartilage graft. A simple technique for closure of a palatal fistula using a conchal cartilage graft as a substitute for nasal lining flaps is reported. This graft simplifies the repair of the palatal fistula and protects the suture line of the oral covering flaps from recurrence. \nProspective evaluation of maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels in 3428 pregnancies. As part of a multicenter prospective study, second-trimester human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein concentrations were evaluated. Data included maternal age, human chorionic gonadotropin level, alpha-fetoprotein level, weight, race, and pregnancy outcome of 3428 pregnancies at between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation. The results of the study indicate that human chorionic gonadotropin levels decrease as maternal weight increases, that weight-adjusted human chorionic gonadotropin levels for Oriental and black women are higher than for white or Hispanic women, and that twin pregnancies have higher human chorionic gonadotropin levels than singleton pregnancies. Of 255 pregnancies that did not have normal outcomes, 54 (21.2%) had human chorionic gonadotropin levels greater than 2.0 multiples of the median and 26 (10.2%) had alpha-fetoprotein levels greater than 2.5 multiples of the median. Of 11 pregnancies with fetal aneuploidy, 6 (54.5%) had human chorionic gonadotropin levels greater than 2.0 multiples of the median. It is concluded that in human chorionic gonadotropin screening programs for fetal Down syndrome, weight and race adjustments are necessary for accurate risk assessment. \nSingle motor end-plates in myasthenia gravis and LEMS at different firing rates. The jitter and frequency of blocking was studied at single motor end-plates in 10 patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and in a patient with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), using single fiber EMG (SFEMG) with axonal microstimulation at rates varying from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz. While some myasthenic motor end-plates showed lowest degrees of transmission disturbance at the lowest rates and most pronounced abnormality at the highest rates of stimulation, over one-half were most abnormal at intermediate rates and improved at higher rates. In 1 patient, all end-plates behaved in this way. On the other hand, all end-plates in the LEMS patient showed the expected improvement of the abnormal jitter and blocking on increasing the stimulation rate. It is argued that improvement of jitter and blocking at higher rates, unless dramatic, does not necessarily suggest a presynaptic abnormality. \nFever: management and self-medication. Results from a Norwegian population study. A representative sample of the Norwegian population was interviewed in 1988 as part of a monthly national opinion poll to investigate lay management and self-medication of fever. Six hundred and nineteen women and 592 men over the age of 15 were interviewed in their homes. Approximately one-fifth reported inappropriate measuring of body temperature. A variety of management and self-medication was found. In cases of common cold or influenza with fever, 35% would use antipyretics. Forty per cent would start to use antipyretics at a temperature below 39.0 degrees C. Forty-four per cent did not know any antipyretic brand names at all. The results indicate a need for more definite and consistent information to make fever management and self-medication more rational. Such information should be discussed and given by general practitioners, nurses at child welfare centers and pharmacists. \nMicroscopic hematuria and calculus-related ureteral obstruction. The evaluation of patients with ureteral calculi in the emergency department has historically included urinalysis (UA) and intravenous pyelograms (IVP). This retrospective study was done to determine if a statistically significant relationship existed between the degree of calculus-related ureteral obstruction, proven by IVP, and the presence or absence of microscopic hematuria. Urine red blood cells were recorded as less than 3 rbc/hpf (negative) or greater than or equal to 3 rbc/hpf (positive). IVPs were recorded as nonsevere or severe. IVP criteria were based on the presence or absence of extravasation, greater than 2-hour ureteral filling times, and a numerical scoring system of 1 to 4 for ureteral or calyceal dilatation and nephrogenic effect. Eighty-nine men (72%) had non-severe obstructions and 34 (28%) had severe obstructions. Twenty-five women (68%) had nonsevere obstructions and 12 (32%) had severe obstructions. Of the 28 patients with normal UAs, 11 had severe ureteral obstructions and 17 had nonsevere ureteral obstructions. There were no statistically significant differences between the presence or absence of significant microscopic hematuria and the presence or absence of severe ureteral obstruction. Microscopic hematuria is neither sensitive nor specific in determining the degree of calculus-related ureteral obstruction. \nProlonged QT interval and risk of sudden death in South-East Asian men. Sudden death in sleep occurs in substantial numbers among young men in South-East Asia. The frequencies of electrocardiographic abnormalities were measured in groups with varying risks of such sudden death. The mean heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater among 123 Laotian refugees in Thailand at high risk (405 [95% confidence interval 397-413] ms) than in 77 Laotian refugees in the United States at lower risk (364 [359-369] ms) and 199 non-Asian US residents at negligible risk (358 [354-362] ms). Among refugees in Thailand, prolonged QTc interval was associated with poor thiamine status and a history of seizure-like episodes in sleep. Thiamine deficiency may be a cause of prolonged QT interval and sudden death in this region. \nAntepartum testing in the hypertensive patient: when to begin. Antepartum testing has been recommended for patients whose pregnancies are complicated by hypertension. Although this is considered accepted practice, there are little data available to help the clinician know when to start testing. To help answer this question in patients with chronic hypertension and nonproteinuric pregnancy-induced hypertension, we reviewed the results of all antepartum tests between 1976 and 1987 in patients with these diagnoses. The primary mode of surveillance in the majority of our patients was the contraction stress test. We determined when patients first had positive contraction stress test results and when intervention occurred because of an abnormal antepartum test result. There were a total of 917 patients tested with these diagnoses. Fifty-three (5.8%) of these patients had at least one positive contraction stress test result. Twenty-two patients were delivered of infants before 35 weeks' gestation because of abnormal antepartum test results. Those with early intervention (less than 35 weeks' gestation) could not be differentiated from those with later intervention (greater than or equal to 35 weeks' gestation) by maternal age, diastolic blood pressure, or systolic blood pressure at the time of testing. The majority of patients who were delivered of infants before 35 weeks' gestation had a concomitant diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, intrauterine growth retardation, diabetes mellitus, or superimposed preeclampsia. On the basis of when compromise was evident, patients with these diagnoses may require testing to be started as early as the fetus is considered viable. However, in those without these diagnoses, the clinician may delay the beginning of testing until 33 weeks' gestation without significant risk of pregnancy loss before testing. \nEpithelial downgrowth following the removal of iris inclusion cysts. We present three patients in whom epithelial downgrowth occurred following the excision of iris inclusion cysts. The sheet-like downgrowth was aggressively treated and successfully eradicated in two of the three patients. Early identification and prompt therapy are essential. \nClinical syndromes and differential diagnosis of spinal disorders. In this article an overview of the different clinical aspects of spinal syndromes is presented. The common disorders involving the spinal cord, the spine, and the intervertebral disc are emphasized. \nRectosigmoid varices and other mucosal changes in patients with portal hypertension. A prospective study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of anorectal varices and their clinical significance as well as to study other proctosigmoidoscopic changes in 75 patients with portal hypertension of diverse etiology. Sixty-seven patients (89.3%) had lower gastrointestinal varices with no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in prevalence between cirrhosis (92.1%), noncirrhotic portal fibrosis (87%), and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (85.7%). The rectum was the most common site of lower gastrointestinal varices. External anal and sigmoid colonic varices almost always occurred in the presence of rectal and/or internal anal varices. There was no correlation between the presence of rectosigmoid varices and the severity of esophagogastric mucosal changes or portal hypertension. There was no suggestion that esophageal variceal sclerotherapy influenced the presence of anorectal varices. Seven patients (9.3%) had recent hematochezia, including three patients in whom it occurred in the absence of any upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Varices were the cause of bleeding in at least five patients. An abnormal mucosal vascular pattern in the form of telangiectasias or spiders was seen, irrespective of etiology of portal hypertension, in nine patients (12%). Hemorrhoids were present in 31 patients (41.3%) with an age-related difference (p less than 0.05) between patients with cirrhosis (55.3%) and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (21.4%). \nGonadal vein thrombosis in patients with acute gastrointestinal inflammation: diagnosis with CT. During a 31-month period, evidence of gonadal vein thrombosis (GVT) was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) in seven patients who had a broad spectrum of acute gastrointestinal inflammatory lesions, including diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, appendicitis with abscess, and perforated appendix with pseudomembranous colitis. All patients had lower abdominal pain, tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis. CT demonstrated thrombus through the length of the gonadal vein in each patient; the entire lumen of the vein was filled. No symptoms relating to GVT were present. GVT may resolve with treatment of the underlying enteric disease alone, and anticoagulant therapy may not be necessary. \nDiagnosis and management of retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcoma. Retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas are locally invasive tumors that remain occult for long periods and grow quite large due to the abdominal cavity's remarkable ability to accommodate these slowly expanding masses with a paucity of attendant symptoms. An open biopsy is required to establish diagnosis definitively. Despite improved imaging techniques and preoperative and intraoperative patient management, resectability has not changed significantly in the past 20 years. Even with an aggressive operative approach, only one half the tumors can be resected completely, and of those, more than 90% recur locally and result in the death of the patient. The addition of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy has not altered this pattern of local failure, in contrast to promising results with extremity soft-tissue sarcoma. Because of the rarity of these tumors, there is an urgent need to establish a national retroperitoneal sarcoma registry and to form cooperative intergroup studies to evaluate, treat, and apply innovative multimodality combination therapies to these otherwise lethal tumors. \nAbsence of autoantibodies in primary fibromyalgia. Sera from patients with primary fibromyalgia (223 sera, 210 women; 13 men) were analyzed, by immunofluorescence microscopy, for the presence of antibodies directed against cell nuclei (ANA), smooth muscle, mitochondria and other tissue antigens present in cryostat sections of rat organs (liver, kidney and stomach). Sera from blood donors (255 sera, 75 women; 180 men) served as a comparative group. The occurrence of serum autoantibodies in patients with fibromyalgia did not differ significantly from the reference group. Our results differ from those of others, who have suggested a relation between fibromyalgia and inflammatory rheumatic diseases. \nCan decision analysis help in the management of giant hemangioma of the liver? [editorial] We explore the trade-off between the risk and expected benefits from resection of giant liver hemangioma (GLH), one larger than 4 cm in diameter. We searched the English-language literature for studies of the postoperative mortality after resection of GLH and of the outcome of expectantly treated patients. The results of the data synthesis showed an operative mortality of 1.5% (90% confidence intervals, 0.1-3.0%) and an early surgical morbidity of up to 13%. Mortality among the 37 reported cases with ruptured GLH was 78%. There were no cases of spontaneous or traumatic rupture of unresected GLH during a follow-up of a total of 282 patient years. The main source of ambiguity regarding the management of GLH is the uncertain risk of its rupture. Rough estimates of this risk based on published data suggest that surgical resection is not justified in asymptomatic GLH. Yet, although rare, rupture of GLH does occur with disastrous consequences. Future research may attempt to define patient subsets whose GLHs are at higher risk of rupture, and in whom preventive resection may improve survival. \nIsolation of a yeast artificial chromosome spanning the 8;21 translocation breakpoint t(8;21)(q22;q22.3) in acute myelogenous leukemia. The 8;21 translocation is one of the most common specific rearrangements in acute myelogenous leukemia. We have identified markers (D21S65 and a Not I boundary clone, Not-42, referred to as probe B) flanking the chromosome 21 translocation breakpoint (21q22.3) that demonstrate physical linkage in normal genomic DNA, by using at least three restriction endonucleases (Not I, Sac II, and BssHII), and that are located not more than 250-280 kilobases apart. Pulsed-field gel analysis of DNA from somatic cell hybrids containing the 8;21 translocation chromosomes demonstrates rearrangement of these markers. A 470-kilobase yeast artificial chromosome, YAC-Not-42, has been isolated that contains both probes. Mapping of lambda subclones constructed from YAC-Not-42 suggests that greater than 95% (25/26 probes tested) of the yeast artificial chromosome DNA is located on the proximal (D21S65) side of the breakpoint. In situ hybridization studies using metaphase chromosomes from five acute myelogenous leukemia patients with the 8;21 translocation confirmed these results and demonstrated the translocation of probe B to the derivative chromosome 8. A chromosome walk of approximately 39 kilobases from probe B has allowed identification of the breakpoint in DNA from a somatic cell hybrid containing the derivative chromosome 8. Since probe B contains conserved DNA sequences and is in close proximity to the translocation breakpoint, it may represent a portion of the involved gene on chromosome 21. \nPoliomyelitis-like paralysis during recovery from acute bronchial asthma: possible etiology and risk factors. A poliomyelitis-like paralytic disease during recovery from an attack of bronchial asthma is described in two young children. They presented at the age of 13 and 22 months, respectively, with acute flaccid paralysis of one or both lower limbs and preserved sensation. Cerebrospinal fluid examinations revealed mild protein elevation in both and pleocytosis in the second infant. Enteroviruses were isolated in a nasal swab and stools of the second patient. Acute onset of flaccid paralysis with absent motor action potential and normal sensory responses, detected by electrophysiologic studies, are highly suggestive of motor anterior horn cell disease in these infants. A multifactorial setup of immune suppression, stress, and neurotoxic drugs during an acute bronchial asthma attack triggered by a viral disease may render the patient vulnerable to viral invasion of the anterior horn cell with enteroviruses other than poliovirus. The overall experience of 22 patients with this serious complication is reviewed. \nPericardio-peritoneal window for malignant pericardial effusion. Pericardio-peritoneostomy for malignant and non-hemorrhagic pericardial effusion is effective. This method relieves the patients of their symptoms and enables them to be discharged within 24 hours. \nHealing assessment of osseous defects of periapical lesions associated with failed endodontically treated teeth with use of freeze-dried bone allograft. Freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) has been used extensively in periodontal surgery and in the treatment of pocket osseous defects resulting from inflammatory periodontal disease. No other endodontic investigation has used this type of graft material in the treatment of bony resorptive defects of the periapical lesions associated with failed endodontic therapy. Therefore this study was conducted with the use of FDBA, to assess healing ability of osseous defects after removal of periapical lesions associated with failed endodontically treated teeth. In all patients periapical lesions were surgically removed with retrograde amalgam seal and the graft material was then carefully packed without pressure into the bony defect. The lesions were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and prepared for histologic examination. Long-term recall demonstrated bone regeneration and good tolerance of allograft material by the periapical tissues. The periapical lesions were either periapical granulomas or apical periodontal cysts. We conclude that FDBA is a biocompatible material of osteogenic potential and can be used effectively in treating osseous defects of periapical lesions associated with failed endodontically treated teeth. \nA selective loss of somatostatin in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Although neuropeptides have been demonstrated to be hippocampal neuromodulators in laboratory animals, their role in human hippocampal physiology or pathophysiology remains to be defined. The concentrations of somatostatin, cholecystokinin octapeptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and dynorphin A 1-17 were determined in hippocampal tissue resected from patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy, a common seizure disorder originating in or near the hippocampus. Control tissue was obtained from cadavera or epilepsy patients in whom the hippocampus was removed during the resection of temporal lobe tumors. Peptide determinations were performed on extracts of punch biopsy specimens taken from six different hippocampal regions. A significant decrease in immunoreactive somatostatin concentration was identified in the dentate gyrus and in region cornu ammonis 4 of cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy specimens. No significant changes were present in any other hippocampal region or in the levels of other peptides. In situ hybridization studies performed on cryostat sections from similar patients confirmed a marked loss of neurons expressing the somatostatin gene, which was restricted to the dentate hilus. The density of specific 125I-somatostatin binding to cryostat sections, as determined by semiquantitative in vitro autoradiography, was significantly increased in the dentate gyrus of the cryptogenic epilepsy patients, compared with tumor control specimens. We conclude that a loss of somatostatin-producing interneurons with an upregulation of dentate somatostatin receptors is a specific and characteristic element in the pathophysiology of human cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy. \nAltered load dependence of postischemic myocardium Intermittent myocardial ischemia can produce areas of postischemic (\"stunned\") myocardium in the heart of the human with coronary artery disease. These areas are no longer ischemic, but have diminished contractile performance. Although the effects of loading conditions on systolic contraction of normal, ischemic, and failing myocardium have been investigated in great detail, the way in which load affects contraction of postischemic myocardium is not known. The aim of this study was to determine in anesthetized dogs how loading conditions affect the systolic function of a region of myocardium after 10 min of ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion. Sets of piezoelectric crystals were implanted in a test zone and in a remote zone of myocardium. Measurements of systolic wall thickening were made during nine combinations of left atrial pressure (3, 6, and 9 cmH2O) and mean arterial pressure (70, 90, and 110 mmHg). One set of measurements was made under baseline conditions, and a second set was made after 10 min of coronary occlusion and 1 h of reperfusion. Ischemia and reperfusion reduced wall thickening in the test zone 36 +/- 3% and diminished the response to increases in preload. In contrast, the response of the test zone to changes in afterload was unchanged. An interaction between the test zone (in which depressed contraction was observed) and the surrounding myocardium (in which enhanced function was observed) produced the appearance of a regional wall motion abnormality as afterload increased. These results emphasize that the load dependence of postischemic myocardium differs from that of normal myocardium and must be taken into account in clinical studies in which regional contraction is used to monitor the heart for ischemia. \nTransesophageal electrocardiography using a temporary pacing balloon-tipped electrode in acute cardiac care. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of obtaining esophageal ECGs using resterilized 3F temporary pacing balloon-inflated electrodes in place of the more expensive pill-electrode and its associated expensive preamplifier. SETTING: Tests were conducted in the emergency department and ICU. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were 12 acutely ill patients for whom standard 12-lead surface ECGs were insufficient to afford accurate, immediate arrhythmia diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS: Reasonable quality esophageal ECGs were obtained by use of the electrodes, generally with minimal patient discomfort. The test never required more than ten minutes. Of the 12 patients who participated in this preliminary study, esophageal ECGs enabled definitive diagnoses to be made in ten cases. CONCLUSION: The use of resterilized temporary pacing balloon-inflated electrodes enables esophageal ECGs to be obtained in an acute care setting. \nEmbolization with steel coils using a saline flush technique. A method using saline flush to push Gianturco steel coils through catheters is described, and has been successfully used in 45 patients. The saline flush technique requires no precise matching of coils and catheters, solves problems associated with the conventional method and simplifies the coil embolization procedure. \nAscites and pleural effusions associated with endometriosis. We report a case of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions associated with an endometrioma in a 26-year-old woman of Chinese descent. She had a right salpingo-oophorectomy and partial omentectomy performed, and she received leuprolide acetate depot injections after the operation. We believe this is the first description of use of a GnRH agonist to treat this rare condition. \nSodium-lithium countertransport and hypertension in Rochester, Minnesota. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether increased sodium-lithium countertransport is associated with essential hypertension in the general Caucasian population and to determine whether this association is independent of the effects of gender, age, body size, and plasma lipids. We studied 543 men and 589 women from the population of Rochester, Minnesota. Mean sodium-lithium countertransport was higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects in men (370 +/- 147 [mean +/- SD] versus 315 +/- 110 mumol/l red blood cells [RBC]/hr, p less than 0.001) and in women (339 +/- 114 versus 269 +/- 92 mumol/l RBC/hr, p less than 0.001). Interindividual differences in plasma triglycerides, body mass index (wt/[ht]2), and plasma total cholesterol explained 13.0% of sodium-lithium countertransport variation in men (p less than 0.001) and 20.2% in women (p less than 0.001). Age did not predict additional sodium-lithium countertransport variation in either gender. Slopes of the regressions of sodium-lithium countertransport on plasma triglycerides, body mass index, and plasma total cholesterol did not differ between diagnostic groups in men (p = 0.31) or in women (p = 0.29). After adjustment to remove sodium-lithium countertransport variation attributable to these covariates, mean sodium-lithium countertransport remained significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects in men (354 +/- 139 versus 319 +/- 104 mumol/l RBC/hr, p less than 0.01) and in women (311 +/- 103 versus 278 +/- 83 mumol/l RBC/hr, p less than 0.01). \nEffects of enteral fat emulsion on fat absorption in obstructive jaundiced rats. The effects of fat emulsion given enterally on fat absorption were studied with obstructive jaundiced rats (J group) as compared with jaundice-free rats (C group). The J and C groups were subdivided into JE and CE groups using emulsified fat for the fat absorption test, and JU and CU groups using unemulsified fat. Rats in all groups were fed for 7 days with regular rat chow. After fasting for 12 hours, 14C-labeled fat emulsion was infused to the JE and CE, and 14C-labeled unemulsified fat to the JU and CU groups through a gastrostomy for the absorption test. The hourly and cumulative output of 14CO2 by respiration, absorption rate of 14C-labeled fat in the intestine, and metabolic oxidation rate of the absorbed fat were determined during an 8-hour period after the gastroenteral administration of emulsified or unemulsified fat. The peak of hourly output was seen after the first 2 hours in the CE, JE, and CU groups, following which a remarkable decline was seen in the CE and CU groups. However, a more gentle descent in the JE, and fluctuation at a low level in the JU group were observed. The cumulative output in the JE was 61% of that in the CE, while the output in the JU was 16% of that in the CU group. The absorption rate in the JE was 81% of that in the CE group, while the rate in the JU was 22% of that in the Cu group. \nCongenital cystic eye with multiple ocular and intracranial anomalies. We describe a newborn with congenital cystic eye, contralateral persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, and cerebrocutaneous abnormalities. The cerebrocutaneous abnormalities consisted of agenesis of the corpus callosum, midbrain deformity, malformed sphenoid bone, right upper eyelid coloboma, and a left periocular hamartoma. The results of karyotype analysis of the patient and his parents were normal. The association of congenital cystic eye with contralateral persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. Although no unifying diagnosis exists for the collection of anomalies demonstrated in this patient, the term cranial ectodermopathy broadly classifies most of the defects. \nDetection of talocalcaneal coalitions by magnification bone scintigraphy. Fibrocartilaginous talocalcaneal coalitions are very difficult to identify on plain radiography in symptomatic children and adolescents before gross ossification occurs. Computed tomography (CT) has been successful in identifying osseous and some fibro-osseous coalitions. In this series, magnification imaging of the tarsus on bone scintigraphy in the medial-lateral projection correctly identified talocalcaneal coalitions, seven of the nine bars were fibrous or fibro-osseous. Three of the fibrous lesions were equivocal or normal on conventional radiography and CT. Physiologic accumulations of activity in the growing hind foot are also presented from a control pediatric population. Magnification scintigraphy of the hind foot is offered as an adjunct to plain radiography and CT in the diagnosis of elusive nonosseous subtalar bars. \nPrognostic significance of basement membrane deposition in operable squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. Tumor histology, stage of disease, and performance status are the most important prognostic factors in squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC). A potentially important descriptor is the pattern of tumor growth as reflected in the dissolution of preexisting or deposition of newly formed basement membrane (BM) around tumor cell nests. The possible correlation between the pattern of BM deposition and patient survival was investigated. Immunohistochemistry testing, using polyclonal antibodies to human type IV collagen, was done on tumor samples of 68 patients with operable Stages I or II SqCLC, and BM staining was scored semiquantitatively. More than 75% immunoreactivity was scored as extensive BM and less than 75% as moderate or limited BM. In six patients, no immunoreactivity could be detected. In 27 of 62 patients, extensive and, in 35 of 62 patients, moderate-limited BM deposition was found. This deposition had a significant effect on survival (P = 0.02). Cox regression analysis, including BM deposition and tumor stage, indicated that BM deposition might also have value as an additional independent prognostic indicator for survival (P = 0.02). Deposition of an appreciable amount of BM in the center of the SqCLC was a prognostically favorable sign, independent of tumor stage. \nGenes for epilepsy mapped in the mouse. The neurological mutant mouse strain E1 is a model for complex partial seizures in humans. The inheritance of epileptic seizures with seven conventional chromosomal markers and over 60 endogenous proviral markers was studied by means of back-crosses of E1 with two seizure-resistant strains, DBA/2J and ABP/LeJ. The major gene responsible for this epileptic phenotype (El-1) was localized to a region distal with respect to the centromere on chromosome 9. At least one other gene, El-2, linked to proviral markers on chromosome 2, also influences the seizure phenotype. In addition, a potential modifier of seizures was detected in the DBA/2J background. The location of El-1 on distal chromosome 9 may allow identification of an epilepsy candidate gene in humans on the basis of conserved synteny with human chromosome 3. \nThymic carcinoid. Carcinoid of the thymus is a rare neoplasm. Differentiation from thymoma is important because they have entirely different prognosis. A patient in whom a 19 x 18 x 12 cm carcinoid tumor of the thymus was surgically removed is presented. The tumor metastasized to peritracheal and internal mammary nodes, and invaded the SVC, pleura, lung, and pericardium. This is apparently the largest reported tumor of its kind. Prior to induction of anesthesia cardiopulmonary bypass and rigid bronchoscopy were readily available. Awake intubation was utilized. Even though long-term prognosis is poor, an aggressive surgical approach and adjuvant radiotherapy may achieve extended survival with excellent quality of life. Central aspects of the disease as well as pivotal therapeutic points are discussed. \nBacterial invasion of the biliary system by way of the portal-venous system. It has been suggested that bacteria in the intestine gain access into the biliary tract by entering the portal-venous blood. We have tested the hypothesis of hematogenous infection of the biliary system in cats. The animals were treated in three different groups: group A (no biliary obstruction), group B (acute biliary obstruction) and group C (chronic biliary obstruction). A mutant strain of Escherichia coli was infused into the splenic vein of cats at three different dosages (10(7), 10(5) and 10(3) with sham controls. In the unobstructed biliary system, the mutant E. coli was isolated from the bile 30 min and 90 min after the infusion of 10(7) and 10(5) E. coli, respectively. No bacteria were found in the bile with the infusion of 10(3) E. coli and in the control animals. Bile flow was significantly reduced with the infusion of bacteria. The biliary excretion of E. coli in group B was similar to that in group A. In group C, the bile output in the first hour was very high but declined rapidly. E. coli was excreted into the bile at all three dosages of infusion after 30 min. Histological sections of the liver showed that the infused bacteria entered the sinusoidal blood and that some were phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. The portal-venous blood was considered an important route of bacterial invasion into the biliary system, and the penetration of bacteria was facilitated in biliary obstruction. \nMedical treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Our understanding of PUD and its treatment has improved dramatically during the past 15 years. During this time, many new effective drugs have been approved by the FDA, and possibly even more potent and effective therapies are now being evaluated. The H2-blockers, sucralfate, and antacids heal over 90% of duodenal ulcers in 6 to 8 weeks, and H2-blockers heal about 80% of gastric ulcers by 8 weeks and over 90% by 12 weeks. The new, more potent pump blockers (omeprazole) promise to be even more effective drugs, even for the healing of patients who are taking NSAIDS. However, the potential hazards of marked, long-term acid suppression must still be evaluated. Maintenance therapy with H2-blockers or sucralfate, ideally used for patients who would otherwise have frequent symptomatic recurrences of duodenal ulcer disease or who have had complications, reduces the relapses, especially symptomatic relapses. Maintenance therapy with H2-blockers also seems to reduce the recurrences of GUD, but this use has not yet received FDA approval. Elimination of H. pylori infection with antibiotics may prove to reduce recurrent ulcer disease and negate the need for maintenance therapy. Colloidal bismuth subcitrate alone, which suppresses but does not eradicate H. pylori infection, seems to be an effective ulcer drug and may even reduce the rate of early recurrences. Effective ulcer therapy, especially if it prevents recurrent disease, may reduce the complications of PUD, but this expectation has yet to be established. The use of prophylactic cytoprotective prostaglandins (misoprostol) reduces the incidence of NSAID-induced GUD. \nSinusoidal portal hypertension in hepatic amyloidosis. Hepatic venous catheterisation and transvenous liver biopsy were performed in five patients with hepatic amyloidosis. In three patients, hepatic venous pressures were normal and histological examination of the liver biopsy specimen showed discrete and sparse perisinusoidal amyloid deposits. In the other two, however, the gradient between wedged and free hepatic venous pressures was increased (12 and 16 mmHg; normal 1-4 mmHg) and amyloid deposits were abundant and diffuse in the Disse's space. This study shows that portal hypertension in patients with hepatic amyloidosis is of the sinusoidal type and is related to the reduction of vascular space of hepatic sinusoids by massive perisinusoidal amyloid deposits. Furthermore, portal hypertension is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with hepatic amyloidosis. \nHelicobacter pylori infection and the risk of gastric carcinoma BACKGROUND. Infection with Helicobacter pylori has been linked with chronic atrophic gastritis, an inflammatory precursor of gastric adenocarcinoma. In a nested case-control study, we explored whether H. pylori infection increases the risk of gastric carcinoma. METHODS. From a cohort of 128,992 persons followed since the mid-1960s at a health maintenance organization, 186 patients with gastric carcinoma were selected as case patients and were matched according to age, sex, and race with 186 control subjects without gastric carcinoma. Stored serum samples collected during the 1960s were tested for IgG antibodies to H. pylori by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data on cigarette use, blood group, ulcer disease, and gastric surgery were obtained from questionnaires administered at enrollment. Tissue sections and pathology reports were reviewed to confirm the histologic results. RESULTS. The mean time between serum collection and the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma was 14.2 years. Of the 109 patients with confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma (excluding tumors of the gastroesophageal junction), 84 percent had been infected previously with H. pylori, as compared with 61 percent of the matched control subjects (odds ratio, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.3). Tumors of the gastroesophageal junction were not linked to H. pylori infection, nor were tumors in the gastric cardia. H. pylori was a particularly strong risk factor for stomach cancer in women (odds ratio, 18) and blacks (odds ratio, 9). A history of gastric surgery was independently associated with the development of cancer (odds ratio, 17; P = 0.03), but a history of peptic ulcer disease was negatively associated with subsequent gastric carcinoma (odds ratio, 0.2; P = 0.02). Neither blood group nor smoking history affected risk. CONCLUSIONS. Infection with H. pylori is associated with an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and may be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of this malignant condition. \nIschemic complications of abdominal aortic surgery. From 1982 through 1988, 634 consecutive patients underwent abdominal aortic reconstruction for occlusive (37%) or aneurysmal (63%) disease. We studied the ischemic problems affecting the branches of the aorta, excluding the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. Ischemic colitis (0.6%), spinal cord ischemia (0.16%), renal insufficiency (17%), and lower limbs ischemia (6.5%) were the major problems encountered. We identified the most significant factors associated with these complications such as hypotension, emergency, hypovolemia, preoperative renal function, suprarenal clamping, the quality of the preoperative investigation, and have suggested some specific preventive measures. \nThe role of bupivacaine in post-tonsillectomy pain. The peritonsillar tissues on one side of 45 consecutive patients undergoing tonsillectomy were infiltrated with bupivacaine and adrenaline, the opposite side serving as a control. Although a significant difference was noted between the two sides this was not a substantial difference in terms of pain relief. \nSonography of abnormal lymph nodes in vitro: correlation of sonographic and histologic findings. The sonographic evaluation of lymph nodes is based primarily on evaluation of their shape and size. Recently, however, the availability of high-frequency transducers has made consideration of internal structure possible. An important objective is to determine whether node enlargement is due to inflammatory or neoplastic processes. To determine the accuracy of sonography for this purpose, we obtained in vitro sonograms of 53 enlarged lymph nodes excised from 41 patients during surgery for neoplastic or nonneoplastic disease. The sonograms were obtained with 7.5- and 10-MHz transducers. They were interpreted by a radiologist who was unaware of the clinical diagnosis. The nodes were subsequently processed for anatomohistologic study; findings were compared side by side. In 26 of the 53 nodes, sonograms showed an identifiable central echogenic line, which on histologic specimen corresponded to the internal part of the medulla where the lymphatic sinuses converge. All these nodes were benign. Two other nodes had an echogenic internal structure not resembling the normal hilum; in one case this was caused by metastatic disease and in the other by fibrosis. Sonograms of the remaining 25 nodes showed no detectable hilar structure; 21 were involved by a tumor and four had diffuse fatty replacement. Our results suggest that the sonographic finding of a central echogenic line is a valid criterion of benignity. Absence of this finding may be due to factors other than neoplastic disease, such as fatty replacement. \nA generalized description of Wenckebach behavior with analysis of determinants of ventricular cycle-length variation during ambulatory electrocardiography. Although variation in ventricular cycle length during Wenckebach-type second-degree atrioventricular block traditionally has been explained by the direction of incremental change in PR lengthening preceding the blocked complex, changing PP intervals can also affect Wenckebach periodicity. A generalized algebraic solution was derived to define changing ventricular cycle length as a function of both changing PP and changing incremental PR interval behavior in Wenckebach block. Based on this solution, the determinants of cycle-length variation were examined for 65 episodes of Wenckebach block detected by ambulatory electrocardiography in 51 patients. As previously demonstrated, only 20% (13 of 65) of Wenckebach episodes were characterized by the \"classic\" shortening of RR intervals; in contrast, ventricular cycle length increased in 57% (37 of 65) and remained constant in 23% (15 of 65) of cases. Algebraic analysis of these episodes revealed that the direction of ventricular cycle-length change preceding the blocked complex was primarily determined by the direction of change of incremental PR intervals in only 35% (23 of 65) of Wenckebach episodes; RR change was governed by the direction of change of preceding PP intervals in 34% (22 of 65) and by equal change of PP and incremental PR intervals in 31% (20 of 65) of these episodes. Both inverse and concordant relationships between changing RP and PR intervals were primarily determined by the direction of PP variation during in vivo Wenckebach block. These data confirm that classic Wenckebach block is less common than \"atypical\" Wenckebach periodicity and demonstrate that RR variation in Wenckebach block is governed by the changing PP interval as often as by the changing incremental PR interval. \nVentilatory responses to chemoreceptor stimulation after hypoxic acclimatization in awake goats. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that exposure to prolonged hypoxia results in altered responsiveness to chemoreceptor stimulation. Acclimatization to hypoxia occurs rapidly in the awake goat relative to other species. We tested the sensitivity of the central and peripheral chemoreceptors to chemical stimuli before and after 4 h of either isocapnic or poikilocapnic hypoxia (arterial PO2 40 Torr). We confirmed that arterial PCO2 decreased progressively, reaching a stable value after 4 h of hypoxic exposure (poikilocapnic group). In the isocapnic group, inspired minute ventilation increased over the same time course. Thus, acclimatization occurred in both groups. In goats, isocapnic hypoxia did not result in hyperventilation on return to normoxia, whereas poikilocapnic hypoxia did cause hyperventilation, indicating a different mechanism for acclimatization and the persistent hyperventilation on return to normoxia. Goats exposed to isocapnic hypoxia exhibited an increased slope of the CO2 response curve. Goats exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia had no increase in slope but did exhibit a parallel leftward shift of the CO2 response curve. Neither group exhibited a significant change in response to bolus NaCN injections or dopamine infusions after prolonged hypoxia. However, both groups demonstrated a similar significant increase in the ventilatory response to subsequent acute exposure to isocapnic hypoxia. The increase in hypoxic ventilatory sensitivity, which was not dependent on the modality of hypoxic exposure (isocapnic vs. poikilocapnic), reinforces the key role of the carotid chemoreceptors in ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia. \nShower versus sink bath: evaluation of heart rate, blood pressure, and subjective response of the patient with myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a sitting shower versus a sitting sink bath in low-risk patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Heart rate, blood pressure (mean blood pressure and rate-pressure-product), ratings of perceived exertion, and occurrence of symptoms during the baths and between resting, bathing, and recovery periods were evaluated. Thirty patients with MI were tested during their first and second self-bath on 2 consecutive days between 2 and 9 days after MI. The bathing methods produced significant increases from the resting values in all the variables (p less than or equal to 0.05). No significant differences between the resting and recovery values existed (p greater than 0.05). Ten subjects experienced atypical responses to bathing as indicated by heart rate and blood pressures. Fatigue was the most frequently encountered symptom at rest and during the bathing activities. The findings suggest that low-risk patients with MI can choose between a sitting sink bath or a sitting shower as their first self-bath after MI, based on preferences. However, because the bathing activity (and not the bathing method) did produce some atypical responses in one third of the subjects, readiness to engage in bathing activities should be individually assessed by objective and subjective criteria. \nAcute leukemia after a primary myelodysplastic syndrome: immunophenotypic, genotypic, and clinical characteristics. We studied the nature of blast cells in 41 patients with acute leukemia following a previous primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by a combined multiparameter analysis including morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic (Igs, T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta, -gamma, and -delta and the major breakpoint cluster region [M-bcr]) investigations. In addition, the clinical and hematologic characteristics according to the immunophenotype of blast cells were analyzed. Our results show that, although the granulocytic and/or monocytic lineages are those most commonly involved in these acute leukemias, other cell components, including the megakaryocytic and lymphoid, may be present (12% and 15% of the cases, respectively). Moreover, both morphologic and phenotypic studies show the frequent coexistence of two or three cell populations. Interestingly, in all cases the lymphoblastic component constantly displayed an early B phenotype (CD19+, CD10-, TdT+). Upon analyzing whether the type of MDS conditioned any differences in the immunophenotype of blast cells, we observed that, although the lymphoid lineage may be involved in all MDS subgroups, some differences emerge within the myeloid leukemic transformations. Thus, the refractory anemias with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation displayed a significantly higher incidence of myeloblastic and megakaryoblastic transformations, while in the RA, RA with ring sideroblasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, the granulo-monocytic phenotype predominated. In addition, our results show that the clinical and hematologic characteristics of these patients may be partially related to the immunophenotype of the blast cells. Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements were found in two of 19 patients analyzed (11%), one with a hybrid leukemia (lymphoid-myeloid) and the other with a granulo-monocytic phenotype. Two other hybrid transformations analyzed were in germline configuration. Gamma and delta gene rearrangements were found in 21% and 37% of these acute transformation, respectively. The TCR-beta and M-bcr were in germline configuration in all 19 cases studied. In summary, immunophenotype and molecular studies point to a pluripotent stem cell with preferential myeloid commitment as the target cell of leukemias following a primary MDS. \nLow power laser biostimulation of chronic oro-facial pain. A double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study in 40 patients. The efficacy of low power laser stimulation in the treatment of chronic oro-facial pain conditions was investigated in a double-blind placebo controlled modified cross-over study in 40 patients. The laser was an invisible infrared (IR) diode laser with an emission at 904 nanometer (nm). Treatment effect was evaluated by means of VAS-scales and global assessment of pain. Outcome of treatment was correlated to changes in urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). The clinical impression was that placebo was superior to laser stimulation. No statistically significant difference between the analgesic effect of the laser and placebo irradiation was found on VAS-scales. A significant (P = 0.05) increase in 5-HIAA excretion was found in the placebo group. It is concluded that the possibility of a substantial placebo response should be taken into consideration using 904 nm (IR) lasers for pain treatment in patients with this type of chronic oro-facial pain. \nA randomized trial of carboplatin versus iproplatin in untreated advanced ovarian cancer. Between August 1984 and October 1987, 120 patients with stage IC to IV epithelial ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to receive carboplatin (400 mg/m2) or iproplatin (300 mg/m2) every 4 weeks as initial treatment. Stratification was made according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and according to size of residual disease after surgery. Response was evaluated after six courses when patients were restaged, with laparoscopy or laparotomy in clinical complete responders or those with no assessable disease. Treatment was then stopped in surgically proven complete responders. Patients with partial (PR) or minor response (MR) received a further six courses of their original drug at a reduced dose (carboplatin 300 mg/m2, iproplatin 225 mg/m2). Patients with stable (SD), progressive (PD), or recurrent disease were treated with cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2). The response rates were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 74%) for carboplatin and 38% (95% CI, 26% to 51%) for iproplatin. Fifteen patients were not assessable for response. The median survival was 114 weeks (95% CI, 82 to 233 weeks) for carboplatin patients and 68 weeks (95% CI, 48 to 82 weeks) for iproplatin patients (P = .008). The amount of residual disease after initial laparotomy was a prognostic factor for survival. Myelosuppression was the main toxicity and was greater with iproplatin. This study shows carboplatin to be more active than iproplatin in the treatment of ovarian cancer and less toxic. Few responses to cyclophosphamide occurred following either drug, implying resistance to the alkylating agent. \nDeterminants of late stage diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer: the impact of age, race, social class, and hospital type [published erratum appears in Am J Public Health 1991 Aug;81(8):980] Previous studies of the relationship between cancer stage, age, and race have not controlled for social class and health care setting. Logistic regression analyses, using information from the New York State Tumor Registry and area-level social class indicators, demonstrated that, in New York City, older Black, lower class women in public hospitals were 3.75 and 2.54 times more likely to have late stage breast or cervical cancer, respectively, than were younger White, high social class women in non-public hospitals. \nBreast conservation therapy. Severe breast fibrosis after radiation therapy in patients with collagen vascular disease. Two patients with collagen vascular disease (rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma) had extremely poor cosmetic results after breast radiation therapy (RT). The patient with rheumatoid arthritis received 5251 cGy at 210 cGy per day, followed by a 1600 cGy iridium-192 implant boost. Between 8 and 11 months post-RT she had severe breast fibrosis, retraction, and pain that required a mastectomy for relief. The patient with scleroderma received 5040 cGy at 180 cGy per day without a boost. Between 1 and 4 months post-RT the systemic symptoms of scleroderma progressed and the breast became hard and retracted. Both rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma are chronic systemic diseases characterized by severe inflammation and an autoimmune component. The presence of scleroderma at or before treatment should be considered a contraindication to breast RT, whereas the presence of active rheumatoid arthritis should be considered a relative contraindication. An autoimmune mechanism will be presented to explain both the fibrosis and the systemic progression of collagen vascular disease that was observed. \nAntiinflammatory and antiarthritic properties of a substituted quinoline carboxylic acid: CL 306,293. CL 306,293, a substituted quinoline carboxylic acid at a daily oral dose between 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg suppressed the inflammation and joint destruction (radiological criteria) associated with both developing and established adjuvant arthritis. When a weekly oral dosing regimen was used, joint destruction was attenuated when this agent was administered at a dose of 50 to 200 mg/kg. Inflammation associated with a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in dogs was suppressed at a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg or a weekly dose of 1 mg/kg. At efficacious doses, CL 306,293 had no effects on cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase activities nor did it have an effect on carrageenin induced paw edema. In acute tests, the compound was not ulcerogenic. The above observations indicate that the antiinflammatory effects of CL 306,293 are distinct from those observed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Mechanistic studies conducted and to be published indicate that CL 306,293 down regulates T cell function and this mechanism may account, at least in part, for the antiinflammatory and antiarthritic properties observed in animal models of inflammation and joint destruction. \nVascular complications of lumbar decompression laminectomy and foraminotomy. A unique case and review of the literature. The possibility of vascular injury should always be kept in mind during lumbar laminectomy. Patients with pre-existing vascular disease are predisposed to injury. Unexplained hypotension is highly suggestive of a vascular catastrophe and is an indication for more detailed examination, sometimes laparotomy. If the patient's clinical condition is stable, consider arteriography. The development of high-output cardiac failure in a patient who has recently undergone lumbar laminectomy is almost diagnostic of traumatic arteriovenous fistula. The best prognosis for recovery of acute vascular interruption occurs with immediate treatment within 24-48 hours. Continued awareness of the possible occurrence of these injuries and familiarity with their various manifestations will facilitate early diagnosis, prompt operative repair, and improved mortality. \nFulminant hepatic failure after repeated exposure to isoflurane anesthesia: a case report. A previously healthy but obese 26-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having hepatic dysfunction 17 days after the third of three consecutive exposures to isoflurane anesthesia for paranasal sinus surgery. Serum laboratory findings included elevated aminotransferases and bilirubin. Radiographical evaluations showed no evidence of extrahepatic disease. Serological studies were negative for acute viral infections, and serum copper was normal. The patient's condition deteriorated over the ensuing 17 days, with hyperreflexia, hypoglycemia and a rapid fall in serum aminotransferases with a concomitant rise in bilirubin level and prothrombin time despite maximal medical support. The liver volume as shown by computed tomography fell from 1,290 cm3 to 680 cm3 over 6 days. The patient underwent successful orthotopic liver transplantation 25 days after onset of symptoms. Histopathological examination of the resected liver showed submassive and massive necrosis, with a few foci of microvesicular steatosis and ultrastructural evidence of mitochondrial abnormalities. Although we found insufficient evidence to prove that this case was caused by isoflurane anesthesia, the clinical course and histopathological findings are similar to those in hepatic injury caused by halothane anesthesia. Therefore we report this as a possible case of fulminant hepatic failure resulting from isoflurane anesthesia. \nEndoscopy as an adjuvant to biliary radiologic intervention. Twenty-two patients underwent 24 percutaneous biliary procedures guided with choledochoscopy, an adjunctive percutaneous biliary technique. All but four procedures were performed through established percutaneous tracts; the others, through tracts less than 4 weeks old. The procedures were done for the following reasons: removal of calculi (n = 15), electrohydraulic lithotripsy (n = 1), biliary duct biopsies (n = 8), cauterization of a bleeding tract (n = 1), and evaluation of biliary-enteric anastomoses (n = 11). The only complication was one case of severe nausea after choledochoscopy. This patient required overnight hospitalization and medical treatment. All procedures were technically successful, except one case in which the tract was undersized. All patients received intravenously administered antibiotics before and after the procedure. It is concluded that choledochoscopy is a safe, atraumatic, and well-tolerated method of evaluating and treating biliary disease and that it markedly reduces radiation exposure. It can be performed rapidly with minimal sedation on an in- or outpatient basis. \nImplantation of human fetal ventral mesencephalon to the right caudate nucleus in advanced Parkinson's disease. Disaggregated ventral mesencephalic tissue from single aborted human fetuses of 11 to 18 weeks' gestation was implanted stereotaxically into a consistent striatal site in 12 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. All were receiving optimum levodopa therapy and were examined preoperatively and at 3,6,9, and 12 months postoperatively. Immunosuppression was not used. There were significant sustained improvements at 12 months in three patients; motor fluctuations were absent in two. There were modest group improvements up to 6 months, with increased quality of \"on\" and \"off\" phases, quantity of on times, and specific improvements in contralateral upper limb bradykinesia. Preoperative levodopa requirements were reduced to a mean of 64% at 6 months and 61% at 12 months. Deterioration below baseline ratings occurred in three of nine patients who had consistent follow-up to 12 months. Grafting of midgestational human fetal tissue can lead to improvement in Parkinson's disease. Individual disease severity may be critical, and further trials are needed to identify host factors influencing outcome. \nLaparoscopic nephrectomy: initial case report. A tumor-bearing right kidney was completely excised from an 85-year-old woman using a laparoscopic approach. A newly devised method for intra-abdominal organ entrapment and a recently developed laparoscopic tissue morcellator made it possible to deliver the 190 gm. kidney through an 11 mm. incision. \nThe assessment of visuo-spatial neglect after acute stroke. Forty four consecutive patients with acute hemispheric stroke and forty seven elderly controls with no neurological disease were assessed for visuo-spatial neglect, using a modified neglect test battery. Neglect was found to be equally common in patients with right hemisphere and left hemisphere stroke three days after stroke (72% versus 62%). It was more severe in those with a right hemisphere stroke and resolved more frequently in those with a left hemisphere stroke. The battery was validated against an occupational therapist's assessment of neglect on self-care tasks. The inter-observer reliability was good and it was possible to monitor changes over time with the battery. \nSecond-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and the risk of subsequent fetal death BACKGROUND. The finding of an elevated level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein during the second trimester of pregnancy may indicate that the fetus has died or is about to die. It is uncertain, however, whether the finding is associated with an increased risk of fetal death later in gestation independent of known causes of elevation, such as the presence of neural-tube defects or multiple gestation. METHODS. To address this question, we performed a case-control study of 612 women whose pregnancies ended in fetal death and 2501 women who gave birth to live infants, using reports from California vital statistics for 1987. All the women had signleton pregnancies and alpha-fetoprotein screening in the second trimester. RESULTS. Women with elevated levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester of pregnancy had an increased risk of fetal death, and the risk was increased until term. Women with the highest levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein--greater than or equal to 3.0 times the median value--had a very high risk of fetal death (odds ratio, 10.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.9 to 22.0) as compared with women who had normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels that were 2.0 to 2.9 times the median were also associated with an elevated risk of fetal death (odds ratio, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.4). Elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein were especially likely to be associated with fetal death in cases in which maternal hypertension or placental infarction was also present. CONCLUSIONs. An unexplained elevated level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of subsequent fetal death, up to four to five months after alpha-fetoprotein screening. \nIdentification and characterization of a cis-acting element that interferes with glucocorticoid-inducible activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. The rat hepatoma cell line M1.19 is stably infected by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), and the expression of the virus is induced by glucocorticoid treatment. However, in the 6.10.2 variant of M1.19, an increase in MMTV transcription is hardly detectable upon exposure to hormone. The mechanism of hormone-unresponsiveness in these cells has been unclear. In this study, we show that nuclear extract from 6.10.2 cells contains a specific DNA-binding activity that recognizes a sequence motif extending from positions -163 to -147 on the MMTV promoter. An oligonucleotide probe spanning this region binds a nuclear factor distinct from the glucocorticoid receptor. In vivo competition experiments, where increased amounts of a plasmid containing this element were transfected into 6.10.2 cells, showed a dose-dependent increase in hormonal inducibility of MMTV expression. Together, these results indicate that this sequence motif negatively modulates glucocorticoid-inducible activation of the MMTV promoter. Moreover, we have characterized a nuclear factor that preferentially binds to the coding strand of this element. \nAn alternative for nasal tip reconstruction: the bilateral rotation flap. A large percentage of the skin tumors that dermatologic surgeons treat are located on the nose. Of these, a significant percentage are located on the nasal tip. The nasal tip is notoriously difficult to reconstruct and we present a bilateral rotation flap that may be useful in some instances for reconstruction of this area. \nSimultaneous potentiation and fatigue in quadriceps after a 60-second maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Potential mechanisms of fatigue (metabolic factors) and potentiation (phosphate incorporation by myosin phosphorylatable light chains) were investigated during recovery from a 60-s maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) in the quadriceps muscle of 12 subjects. On separate days before and for 2 h after the 60-s MVC, either a 1-s MVC or electrically stimulated contractions were used as indexes to test muscle performance. Torque at the end of the 60-s MVC was 57% of the initial level, whereas torques from a 1-s MVC and 50-Hz stimulation were most depressed in the immediate recovery period. At this time, muscle biopsy analyses revealed significant decreases in ATP and phosphocreatine and a 19-fold increase in muscle lactate. Conversely, isometric twitch torque and torque from a 10-Hz stimulus were the least depressed of six contractile indexes and demonstrated potentiation of 25 and 34%, respectively, by 4 min of recovery (P less than 0.05). At this time, muscle lactate concentration was still 16 times greater than at rest. An increased phosphate content of the myosin phosphorylatable light chains (P less than 0.05) was also evident both immediately and 4 min after the 60-s MVC. We conclude that the 60-s MVC produced marked force decreases likely due to metabolic displacement, while the limited decline in the twitch and 10-Hz torques and their significant potentiation suggested that myosin phosphorylation may provide a mechanism to enhance contractile force under conditions of submaximal activation during fatigue. \nBlunt cervical spine Brown-Sequard injury. A report of three cases. Cervical spinal cord Brown-Sequard syndrome was diagnosed in three recent victims of blunt injury at the authors' Level II Trauma Center. While anatomic hemisection of the cord, resulting in ipsilateral motor and proprioception loss and contralateral pain and temperature deficit, is a fully understandable concept, in the context of the acute trauma evaluation, these findings may be confusing because they are unexpected. Penetrating trauma is far more likely to cause this uncommon syndrome than vehicular crash, fall, or crushing injury. Pediatric victims frequently have no fracture. Early neurosurgical consultation, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if plain film radiography is uninformative, and consideration for rapid decompression if the deficit and pathologic anatomy warrant, are the recommended approaches. Motor function recovery from blunt injury may be expected within six months, a better prognosis than for penetrating injury causing the syndrome. \nSerum iron and transferrin in acute neuroleptic induced akathisia. Thirty acute psychiatric patients were examined prospectively at the beginning of neuroleptic treatment for acute psychotic symptoms and on average 16 days later. Two alternative hypotheses were examined: 1) neuroleptic treatment affects the levels of serum iron and transferrin; 2) acute akathisia developing during the initial few weeks of treatment is associated with low levels of serum iron and transferrin, either initially or at follow up or both. Serum iron levels did not change on repeat measurement, while there was a small, but significant decrease of serum transferrin. There was a significantly greater decrease in iron and transferrin levels in patients with akathisia on follow up compared with non-akathisics. In addition, akathisia ratings were highly correlated with serum transferrin levels on follow up. \nPerineal excision of the rectum for prolapse in the elderly. A perineal operation is described for the treatment of rectal prolapse. The surgery improves functional outcome by correcting the anatomical anomalies associated with the condition. In 17 elderly women, there was one perioperative death and one recurrence. At a median follow-up of 24 months, 13 patients were able to control solid stool and three were profoundly incontinent. The operation may be an alternative to the more invasive abdominal procedures for the treatment of the majority of patients with prolapse. \nReactive occipital epileptiform activity: is it benign? Occipital epileptiform activity that is almost continuous and reactive to eye opening has been associated with a childhood epilepsy syndrome and basilar migraine with seizures. An association of these syndromes with a benign course had been disputed. In this study, a retrospective investigation of reactive occipital epileptiform activity (ROEA) was performed to determine the prognostic value of this distinctive EGG pattern. The EEG and hospital record of patients with ROEA were reviewed with an observation period of 6 months to 8 years. The patients were divided into good and poor outcome groups based on response to treatment. Of 33 patients, 12 (36.4%) had complete seizure control; 21 (63.6%) continued to have poorly controlled seizures. Only 3 (9.1%) patients were able to discontinue antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) without seizure recurrence. Analysis of clinical and EEG variables showed that a history of perinatal difficulties, abnormal neurologic findings, and abnormal EEG background activities occur significantly more frequently in the poor outcome group. This study suggests that ROEA is not uniformly associated with a benign course and that other factors are involved in determining prognosis of the epilepsy. \nStroke following oral trauma in children. Stroke after oral trauma in children is a rare but catastrophic event. We describe two cases of stroke in children after each child fell with a writing instrument in the mouth. Both children had a latent period prior to the onset of neurologic symptoms. Ischemic infarction in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery was present in both cases. Both children were left with permanent hemiparesis. The case reports are reviewed and diagnosis and therapy are discussed. Emergency physicians should be aware of the risk of neurologic complications following apparently asymptomatic oral trauma. \nThe effect of ERCP on circulating pancreatic enzymes and pancreatic protease inhibitors. The pathogenesis of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-induced pancreatitis is poorly understood. To elucidate a role for pancreatic enzymes in ERCP-induced pancreatitis, we measured serum amylase, lipase, trypsin, and elastase in 25 patients undergoing ERCP. Serum alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin, two major pancreatic protease inhibitors, also were measured. All pancreatic enzymes measured rose significantly after ERCP. Pancreatic duct cannulation was associated with a greater elevation in serum amylase and lipase. Circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin was reduced by 7% (p = 0.04) 6 h after ERCP, whereas circulating alpha 1-antitrypsin increased over the same time period. Papillotomy, stent placement, or underlying disease did not influence changes any further. Three patients developed ERCP-induced pancreatitis. All three patients had circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin levels below 243 mg/dl (p = 0.03). The ERCP-induced alterations in circulating pancreatic enzymes and their inhibitors are similar to changes seen in clinical pancreatitis. Low circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin levels may predispose to ERCP-induced pancreatitis. \nIs routine CT scanning necessary in the preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy? To evaluate the usefulness of CT scanning before carotid endarterectomy, a prospective study was performed on 469 consecutive patients considered for carotid endarterectomy during a 5-year period. All patients underwent carotid duplex scanning and CT scanning before carotid arteriography. Two hundred thirty-seven patients (51%) had transient ischemic attacks, 109 (23%) had a prior stroke, and 122 (26%) were asymptomatic. Results of the CT scan were abnormal in 68 (62%) of the 109 patients with stroke. Fifty-one of the 360 patients (14%) without a clinical history of stroke had an abnormal CT scan outcome. Of patients with a stroke documented by CT scanning, 27 had lacunar infarcts, and 92 had cortical infarcts; these findings did not change surgical management in any patient. CT scanning did not reveal any unsuspected infarcts or tumors. Two hundred thirty carotid endarterectomies were performed on 206 patients. Forty-seven patients (23%) in the operative group had abnormal CT scan findings, but the scan did not influence operative decisions or timing in any case. Seventy-two patients (27%) in the nonoperative group had abnormal CT scan results, but CT scan findings did not exclude any patient from arteriography or surgery. Three perioperative strokes (1.3%) occurred. CT scan findings did not correlate with postoperative neurologic complications. Cost of CT scanning was one-half million dollars in our study alone. Routine CT scanning is unnecessary before carotid endarterectomy and is not cost-effective. \nPeptide selection by MHC class I molecules. Synthetic peptides have been used to sensitize target cells and thereby screen for epitopes recognized by T cells. Most epitopes of cytotoxic T lymphocytes can be mimicked by synthetic peptides of 12-15 amino acids. Although in specific cases, truncations of peptides improves sensitization of target cells, no optimum length for binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules has been defined. We have now analysed synthetic peptide captured by empty MHC class I molecules of the mutant cell line RMA-S. We found that class I molecules preferentially bound short peptides (nine amino acids) and selectively bound these peptides even when they were a minor component in a mixture of longer peptides. These results may help to explain the difference in size restriction of T-cell epitopes between experiments with synthetic peptides and those with naturally processed peptides. \nNo causal relationship between transdermal scopolamine and seizures: methodologic lessons for pharmacoepidemiology. Because of case reports suggesting that use of transdermal scopolamine might be associated with the subsequent development of seizures, a retrospective cohort study was performed with computerized Medicaid claims data. Patients receiving transdermal scopolamine were compared with patients receiving diphenhydramine, meclizine, prochlorperazine, and promethazine. A four-fold increased risk of seizures after transdermal scopolamine use was observed in the claims data. However, this was not supported by the primary medical records. All patients who had seizures after using transdermal scopolamine either had seizures before receiving the drug as well or did not really suffer from seizures. The original finding appeared to be the result of the use of transdermal scopolamine for \"dizziness, rule out seizures\"; the ICD-9-CM coding system does not include \"rule out\" diagnoses. Thus these data do not confirm the existence of an association between seizures and the use of transdermal scopolamine. In addition, this study demonstrates the usefulness of pharmacoepidemiology studies in documenting drug safety and the importance of obtaining primary medical records when performing pharmacoepidemiologic studies with claims data. \nA longitudinal study of respiratory symptoms in aluminum potroom workers. The influence of occupational work exposure and host factors on the incidence of dyspnea and wheezing as reported in questionnaires was examined in 1,301 new employees in aluminum electrolytic potrooms. The incidence appeared to decrease after 2 yr of exposure, and the estimated probability of development of symptoms was nearly 20% after 4 yr. A total of 105 subjects developed dyspnea and wheezing. Of 78 symptomatic subjects who were interviewed, 76% experienced improvement or absence of symptoms when off work. In 523 subjects who were assigned to specific levels of exposure at the end of follow-up, a dose-response gradient was found between the development of symptoms and fluoride exposure. Increased risk with increasing amounts of tobacco was also observed, but childhood allergy and a family history of asthma were not significantly related to the outcome variable. We conclude that both total fluoride exposure and smoking are related to asthmatic symptoms in potroom workers, and the suggestion of a dose-response gradient was found for both variables. However, a causal relationship between fluorides and symptoms should be investigated further by specific bronchial provocation testing and by research for specific antibodies and other immunologic markers. \nPreclinical detection in studies of the etiology, natural history, and treatment of Parkinson's disease. The development of reliable preclinical detection procedures for idiopathic Parkinson's disease may be the fundamental advance required for the establishment of the cause, the natural history, and ultimately, the prevention of this neurodegenerative disorder. The usefulness of these preclinical markers in efforts to better understand the etiology and development of this disorder will relate to whether they are direct measures of dopamine production or indirect measures such as metabolic changes or comorbidity, whether they can be used in the first or later decades of life, whether they are invasive, and whether they are expensive and sophisticated or simple and cheap. An overview of the criteria for evaluation of the utility of specific markers, as well as an assessment of the importance of early markers in future research, is presented. \nOpportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension. The cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension depends on the pretreatment level of blood pressure, age and sex of the patient, presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, long-term control of blood pressure, and the annual costs of treatment. Treatment of very mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, 90-94 mm Hg), even if the benefits do exceed the risks, does not appear to be particularly cost-effective. Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of hypertension management lie in 1) avoidance of patient mislabeling by careful documentation of blood pressures on multiple occasions in the office and during usual activities outside the office before the diagnosis is made and treatment is begun; 2) efforts to increase adherence to scheduled visits and medication regimens; 3) attempts to step-down dosages or discontinue medications after periods of good blood pressure control; 4) explicit consideration of costs, as well as benefits, in decisions on the needed frequency of office visits, choice of medications, and use of laboratory tests; and 5) efforts to improve practice efficiency. Future practice guidelines for hypertension management should take these factors into account and should make trade-offs between benefits, risks, and costs explicit for specific types of patients. \nPrevalence and clinical spectrum of skin diseases in kidney transplant recipients. Cutaneous lesions can be a significant problem in kidney transplant recipients. Factors such as climate and skin types have been implicated as modifiers of these clinical manifestations. With the purpose of determining the prevalence and clinical spectrum of skin diseases in a group of Hispanic kidney transplant recipients in a tropical climate, 82 serial unselected patients were examined. Seventy-eight were found to have some type of skin disease. Infections of the skin were the most common, followed by drug-induced changes and malignant or premalignant cutaneous tumors. Except for the preponderance of superficial mycotic infections, the overall results in our population are in agreement with other series. \nHelicobacter pylori infection induces antibodies cross-reacting with human gastric mucosa. The authors' previous observation that many of the monoclonal antibodies against Helicobacter pylori cross-react with the cells of the human gastric mucosa prompted them to investigate the possibility that gastric self-antigens cross-reacting with H. pylori could be involved in the immune response against this organism. It was found that three antibodies against H. pylori, CB-4, CB-10, and CB-14, that cross-react with the human gastric mucosa also intensely cross-reacted with murine gastric epithelial cells. A strong reaction against autologous mucosa was also evident in the sera of mice immunized with H. pylori but not with other bacteria. A serological study performed in a group of 82 patients undergoing gastroscopy showed that the presence of seropositivity against H. pylori was strongly correlated with the presence of autoantibodies against human antral gastric mucosa. This activity was neutralized after absorption of the sera with H. pylori but not with other gram-negative bacteria. The antibodies in the mouse and in the human did not react with other segments of the gastrointestinal tract or with most of the other organs. Mice bearing hybridomas secreting a cross-reacting antibody (CB-4) had histopathologic abnormalities in their stomachs. These lesions were absent in the stomachs of mice bearing hybridomas secreting a non-cross-reacting antibody (CB-26). It was concluded that H. pylori infection can stimulate antibodies cross-reacting with gastric autoantigens and that this immunologic mechanism may represent a pathogenic link between H. pylori and gastritis. \nIntraoperative identification of cardiac patients at risk to develop postoperative atrial fibrillation. Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complication occurring in 11% to 36% of patients after cardiac operations, which results in increased morbidity and hospital costs. A new electrophysiologic screening test was developed to identify those patients at risk for development of postoperative AF. The test was validated in 50 patients (43 men and 7 women) with a mean age of 59.6 +/- 1.3 years who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with or without other cardiac surgical procedures. After aortic and venous cannulation, but before initiation of bypass, the mid-right atrium was stimulated with a bipolar probe at 25 microA for 3 seconds. Alternating current was increased by 25 microA until AF was induced or up to a maximum of 200 microA. Postoperative AF occurred in 18 patients (36%), 17 of whom had inducible AF (sensitivity = 0.94). Of the remaining 32 AF-free patients, 13 had negative tests (specificity = 0.41). Age and sex were not factors affecting inducibility, although patients who developed AF were older than those who were AF free (63.6 versus 57.3 years, p = 0.02). Length of stay in the intensive care unit was longer for those with postoperative AF than for AF-free patients (3.6 versus 1.9 days, p = 0.02). The negative predictive value of the test was 0.93, and the positive value was 0.47. These data show that this new intraoperative technique may be used to identify patients at risk for postoperative AF. Prophylactic therapy can therefore be directed to only those patients at risk for postoperative AF. \nComparison of morbidity and function after colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis or restorative proctocolectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis. Restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal reservoir (RPC) should prevent colorectal cancer in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Until this is confirmed its role compared with total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) will depend on the relative morbidity and postoperative bowel function after the two procedures. This was analysed in 99 patients (37 RPC, 62 IRA) operated on between 1977 and 1989. Morbidity was greater after RPC with subsequent ileostomy closure (median hospital stay, 24 versus 11 days; complications, 60 versus 21 per cent; reoperation, 29 versus 3 per cent; return to normal activity; 31 versus 14 weeks). There was little difference in bowel function; after IRA median frequency was 3/24 h and urgency (unable to wait 15 min) occurred in 50 per cent, compared with 4.5/24h and 17 per cent after RPC. Night evacuation occurred in 10 and 43 per cent respectively. IRA was performed in younger patients (median 19 versus 31 years) who had fewer bowel motions before operation (2 versus 5/24 h). The greater morbidity of RPC suggests that it should be restricted to patients at higher risk of developing later rectal cancer, including those unavailable for follow-up and those with large or confluent rectal polyps or with curable colon cancer at the initial colectomy. \nAnaphylactic reactions during general anesthesia among pediatric patients--United States, January 1990-January 1991. From March 1990 through January 1991, nine patients at one children's hospital in Wisconsin (hospital A) had onset of anaphylactic reactions (ARs) within 30 minutes following the start of general anesthesia; no patient had had a surgical incision at the time of their reaction. Eight of these patients required admission to the intensive care unit for supportive care. To determine the extent and potential source of the problem, an epidemiologic investigation was conducted at hospital A. \nIdentification of a missense mutation in one allele of a patient with Pompe disease, and use of endonuclease digestion of PCR-amplified RNA to demonstrate lack of mRNA expression from the second allele. Infantile-onset glycogen storage disease type II, or Pompe disease, results from a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha glucosidase (GAA). Sequencing of the cDNA from a cell line (GM 244) derived from a patient with Pompe disease demonstrated a T953-to-C transition that predicted a methionine-to-threonine substitution at codon 318. The basepair substitution resulted in loss of restriction-endonuclease sites for NcoI and StyI. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed both a normal and an abnormal NcoI fragment, indicating that the patient was a genetic compound. NcoI and StyI digestion of cDNA, amplified by PCR from reverse-transcribed RNA, demonstrated that greater than 95% of the GAA mRNA in GM 244 was derived from the allele carrying the missense mutation. The missense mutation was uncommon, since it was not detected in 37 additional GAA-deficient chromosomes, as determined by digestion of genomic DNA with NcoI and hybridization. The amino acid substitution predicts a new potential site for N-linked glycosylation, as well as major changes in secondary structure of the protein. We could confirm that the mutation was responsible for the enzyme deficiency by demonstrating that a hybrid minigene containing the mutation did not express GAA enzyme activity after transient gene expression. We have therefore now provided the first identification of a single-basepair missense mutation in a patient with Pompe disease and furthermore have demonstrated that the patient is a genetic compound with the second allele barely expressing mRNA. \nInflammatory bowel disease. Part I: Nature and pathogenesis. Once regarded as medical curiosities, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have achieved a remarkable change in status recently and today are among the more compelling of all human illnesses. The cause(s) of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not known. Genetic, environmental, microbial, and immunologic factors are involved, but the precise mechanisms are obscure. The incidence of ulcerative colitis is relatively stable, while Crohn's disease continues to increase in frequency. In 10% to 15% of patients, it is hard to differentiate between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis; however, problems with diagnosis usually resolve with time and repeated examinations. In part I of his two-part monograph on IBD, Dr. Kirsner addresses the nature and pathogenesis of the disease. Increased study of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in recent years has generated new knowledge regarding their etiology. Part I focuses on microbial, immunologic, and genetic mechanisms and the inflammatory processes involved in the disease. In part II, which will be presented in next month's issue of Disease-a-Month, Dr. Kirsner deals with the clinical features, course, and management of IBD, based on the author's 55 years of experience with these problems and supplemented by critical examination of the recent (1988-1990) literature. Particular attention is directed to the symptoms and physical findings of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the laboratory, radiologic, endoscopic, and pathologic features, and the many systemic complications. The IBDs are mimicked by several enterocolonic infections and other conditions, making differential diagnosis necessary. Inflammatory bowel disease in children and the elderly conforms to conventional clinical patterns modified by the health circumstances of the respective age groups. Because the cause of IBD has not been established, current medical therapy is facilitative and supportive rather than curative. The principles of medical treatment are approximately the same for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Treatment emphasizes a program rather than a drug and also considers the individuality of the therapeutic response. A clearer understanding of dietary and nutritional needs, including hyperalimentation and electrolyte and fluid balance, aids treatment. Antidiarrheal and antispasmodic preparations and sedatives are prescribed for symptom relief. The bowel inflammation is controlled with sulfasalazine or the newer 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, antibacterial drugs for complications of Crohn's disease and IBD, adrenocortical steroids, and the immunosuppressive compounds 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine, and cyclosporine, as determined in each patient. The surgical procedures available for treatment of ulcerative colitis include total proctocolectomy and ileostomy or ileoanal anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nCerebrovascular CO2 reactivity in migraine: assessment by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 inhalation was studied by transcranial Doppler sonography in 30 patients with classic or common migraine and 39 healthy controls without clinical or ultrasonic signs of arteriosclerosis. Systolic and diastolic Doppler frequencies of the middle cerebral artery were plotted against end-tidal CO2 partial pressure; the reactivity index (I x R) was defined as relative frequency change during a PCO2 increase of 5 mmHg. In the normal subjects, I x R was 20.0 +/- 6.3 for systolic velocities, and 26.0 +/- 8.2 for diastolic values. Migraineurs during their headache-free interval had significantly higher I x R values on the affected side (mean: 41.6 systolic, 61.2 diastolic), compared with either controls (P less than 0.01) or the contralateral side (mean: 28.3 systolic, 30.8 diastolic; P less than 0.01). During the headache attack, CO2 reactivity was significantly lower than normal only for systolic velocities (mean: 8.3; P less than 0.05). Increased CO2 reactivity is thought to be one phenomenon of migraine. Transcranial Doppler CO2 testing of cerebrovascular reactivity is a reliable method that may be of interest for the diagnostic evaluation and management of migraine patients. \nMethotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin in metastatic breast cancer. A phase II trial of the Hoosier Oncology Group. Forty-six eligible patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were treated with a combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC) as first-line chemotherapy. Of 44 patients evaluable for response, 28 (64%) had an objective response, including seven (16%) who had a complete response. The median duration of response was 4 months (range, 0 to 38 months), and the median survival from the time of entry was 14 months (range, less than 1 to greater than 45 months). Myelosuppression was the most common dose-limiting toxicity, with 54% of patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia (including 28% with granulocytopenic fever and one septic death), and cumulative Grade 3 anemia occurred in 28% of patients. Grades 3 to 4 stomatitis was observed in 18% of patients. An active, although highly toxic regimen when used as first-line therapy in MBC, M-VAC has a response rate and survival duration similar to existing, less toxic combination regimens. As such, M-VAC cannot be recommended in preference to other combination chemotherapy regimens in this clinical setting. \nUrodynamic evaluation of the patient with an imperforate anus: a prospective study. Prospective urodynamic evaluation of 14 patients with an imperforate anus revealed detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in 4. Subsequent contrast voiding cystourethrograms demonstrated radiographic changes in all 4 cases, consisting of bladder trabeculation, new onset of vesicoureteral reflux or hydroureteronephrosis. Of the 4 patients 3 had a high (supralevator) imperforate anus, while 1 had a low (infralevator) lesion. Two patients had bony vertebral abnormalities and 2 had normal plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine. Therefore, early urodynamic study is recommended for all patients with an imperforate anus and it should complement neonatal uroradiographic evaluation. The finding of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia should alert the urologist to the need for adjunctive management. \nCentral arteriovenous malformations of the maxillofacial skeleton: case report. Central arteriovenous malformation of the maxillofacial skeleton, though rare, is a well-documented entity. Past treatments have usually included some form of surgical intervention. Surgical resection as an attempt to cure has been effective but costly, ie, in relationship to patient morbidity and hospital expenditures. A case of vascular malformation is presented in which selective angiography and embolization as a primary treatment were used rather than ablative surgery. The patient tolerated the procedures well, with complete resolution of bleeding. \nComparison of the results of electrophysiologic testing after short-term and long-term treatment with amiodarone in patients with ventricular tachycardia. The results of electrophysiologic testing after short-term and long-term treatment with amiodarone were compared in 71 patients with ventricular tachycardia. Electrophysiologic testing was performed in the baseline state after 11 +/- 3 days of treatment with 1.2 to 2.4 gm/day of amiodarone, and after 13 +/- 4 weeks of therapy with a daily amiodarone dose of 400 mg. After short-term therapy, 62% of the patients had an adequate response to amiodarone. In 27 patients who were hemodynamically unstable, ventricular tachycardia was induced and became noninducible or hemodynamically stable after combination therapy with a class I agent. Among 18 patients who did not have inducible ventricular tachycardia after short-term therapy, eight (44%) had inducible, hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia after long-term treatment with amiodarone. On the other hand, six of the 27 patients who had hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia after short-term therapy had an adequate response after long-term treatment with amiodarone. Therefore an adequate electrophysiologic response after short-term therapy does not guarantee a similar response after long-term treatment, and an inadequate response after short-term therapy does not always predict a similar response after long-term therapy. \nStress analgesia: the opioid analgesia of long swims suppresses the non-opioid analgesia induced by short swims in mice. In mice, room temperature swimming for as short a period as 15 sec has been found to induce a non-opioid analgesia with a time course of 10-12 min. As the duration of the swim is increased, an opioid analgesia develops with a longer persistence (25-30 min); the development of the opioid analgesia appears to suppress the expression of the non-opioid analgesia so that none of the latter is evident after 3 min swims. The characteristics of the tail-flick nociceptive test are also described. \nHealth inequalities among British civil servants: the Whitehall II study The Whitehall study of British civil servants begun in 1967, showed a steep inverse association between social class, as assessed by grade of employment, and mortality from a wide range of diseases. Between 1985 and 1988 we investigated the degree and causes of the social gradient in morbidity in a new cohort of 10,314 civil servants (6900 men, 3414 women) aged 35-55 (the Whitehall II study). Participants were asked to answer a self-administered questionnaire and attend a screening examination. In the 20 years separating the two studies there has been no diminution in social class difference in morbidity: we found an inverse association between employment grade and prevalence of angina, electrocardiogram evidence of ischaemia, and symptoms of chronic bronchitis. Self-perceived health status and symptoms were worse in subjects in lower status jobs. There were clear employment-grade differences in health-risk behaviours including smoking, diet, and exercise, in economic circumstances, in possible effects of early-life environment as reflected by height, in social circumstances at work (eg, monotonous work characterised by low control and low satisfaction), and in social supports. Healthy behaviours should be encouraged across the whole of society; more attention should be paid to the social environments, job design, and the consequences of income inequality. \nMagnesium sulfate reverses experimental delayed cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats. We induced experimental delayed cerebral vasospasm by the intracisternal injection of greater than 0.5 ml blood in 30 rats. Seventy-two hours later the basilar artery was exposed via the transclival approach and photographed at high-power magnification through an operating microscope. We then evaluated the effect of topical (n = 30) and intravenous (n = 20) magnesium sulfate on the spastic artery by computerized image analysis. A greater than 50% reduction in baseline diameter of the basilar artery was observed in the rats subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage compared with the 10 controls (p less than 0.0001). Intravenous magnesium sulfate dilated the spastic artery to approximately 75% of the baseline diameter in control rats (p less than 0.0001). Topical magnesium sulfate caused dramatic dilation of the basilar artery in both the control and the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups to near 150% of the baseline diameter in the controls (p less than 0.001). All rats receiving intravenous magnesium sulfate reached therapeutic plasma levels of the ion. Hemodynamic effects were mild and immediately reversible upon cessation of magnesium sulfate administration. We suggest that magnesium has a role in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm in humans. \nComparison of the predictive characteristics of heart rate variability index and left ventricular ejection fraction for all-cause mortality, arrhythmic events and sudden death after acute myocardial infarction.
