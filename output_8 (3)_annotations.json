        "text": "December 1983 had not been previously treated, and were treated at eight cancer centers. When the prognosis of all patients was examined by age, a definite change in the pattern of survival first appeared in the 60- to 69-year-old cohort. The entire older group (60 to 79 years) experienced twice the risk of dying from Hodgkin's disease and four times the risk of dying from other causes than did the younger group. In both groups, stage of disease was the strongest factor in predicting adjusted survival. Delay in treatment and advanced stage at presentation were not characteristic of Hodgkin's disease in older patients as has been postulated. Older patients responded to therapy with a similar complete remission rate (84% v 88% in the younger group, P = .24). From this study, we conclude that (1) Hodgkin's disease in the older adult does not have a different natural history, its major risk factors are similar to those known in other age groups, and thus should be amenable to existing therapeutic approaches; and (2) the prognosis of older patients with Hodgkin's disease has been obscured in previous studies by the inclusion of deaths due to other causes in survival estimates. \nSomatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide and gastrin in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and insulinoma. Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and gastrin were measured in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, insulinoma-bearing rats and their respective controls. Rats injected with streptozotocin exhibited hyperphagia, insulinopenia and severe hyperglycemia. Stomach weights, and the concentrations and total amounts of GRP and gastrin in the stomach, were similar to nondiabetic control rats. The concentration of somatostatin in the stomach of diabetic rats was 25% greater, but the total stomach content of somatostatin was similar to that of control rats. Insulinoma-bearing rats exhibited hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Concentrations of GRP and gastrin in the stomach were 72% and 19% lower, respectively, than in control rats. Despite 45% greater stomach weight, the total stomach content of GRP was 61% lower. Stomach concentrations of somatostatin, and total stomach contents of somatostatin and gastrin, were similar in insulinoma-bearing and control rats. The results demonstrate abnormalities in the stomach concentrations of regulatory peptides in rats with diabetes and insulinoma. These abnormalities are not attributable to changes in food intake alone, suggesting specific effects of these metabolic diseases on gastric regulatory peptides and gastric function. \nPeriorbital hematoma secondary to sinusitis in a child. Periorbital abscess secondary to sinusitis is a well-recognized entity in children. However, subperiosteal hematoma is extremely rare and has been reported in only four adult patients. This article presents the case of a 4-year-old girl with sinusitis, proptosis, and decreased visual acuity. Surgical exploration of the orbit revealed the presence of a large organizing subperiosteal hematoma that was drained. The presence of a periorbital hematoma should be suspected in patients with acute onset of proptosis and findings of a periorbital mass and sinusitis on computed tomographic scan. \nHypoxia-mediated in vivo release of dopamine in nucleus tractus solitarii of rabbits. A wide variety of neuroactive substances have been suggested to be involved in the respiratory depression observed in response to severe hypoxia. By use of the technique of microdialysis, the release of dopamine (DA) was measured in the nucleus tractus solitarii during severe hypoxic provocations (6% O2 in N2) in the adult pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbit. DA release was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Such hypoxic provocations caused pronounced phase of depression in the phrenic nerve activity and enhanced release of DA. After bilateral carotid sinus nerve denervation, acute severe hypoxia did not give rise to enhanced release of DA or to phrenic nerve depression. Mild hypoxic (9% or 12% O2 in N2) or hypercapnic (6% CO2) stimuli resulted in an increased phrenic nerve activity without any concomitant changes in DA release. Decerebration at the midcollicular level in rabbits prevented an enhanced release of DA in the nucleus tractus solitarii during severe hypoxia. The results suggest that 1) DA is involved in the central ventilatory response to severe hypoxia, 2) not only the initial excitatory but also the second depressive phase in response to severe hypoxia is mediated partially by the peripheral chemoreceptors, and 3) the depressive phase is dependent on intact connections from suprapontine structures. \nGliomatosis peritonei with malignant transformation: a case report and review of the literature. Gliomatosis peritonei is the implantation of glial tissue within the peritoneal cavity associated with ovarian teratomas. Previous reports have emphasized improved outcomes when these implants are found to be mature, even if the ovarian component is immature. A 16-year-old female with grade 3 immature teratoma was found on two subsequent laparotomies to have extensive peritoneal implantation of mature glial tissue. More than 5 years after the original surgery she was found to have a malignant abdominal glial neoplasm. This case illustrates a rare finding of malignant transformation of previously mature gliomatosis peritonei. \nGlucagon-induced alteration of serum bile acid level in patients with liver cirrhosis. Percent changes in serum total bile acid level after IV administration of 1 mg glucagon were measured in 61 cirrhotics. Thirty-three of 38 cases with Child's grade A disease showed a reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes; this level was maintained in the majority of them until 120 minutes. A similar mode of serial changes in total bile acid level was also shown in the cases with Child's grade B disease. On the other hand, only 2 of 10 cases with Child's grade C showed a reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes. Reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes after glucagon administration was mimicked by infusion of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate. However, in 3 of 6 cases with elevated total bile acid level at 15 minutes after glucagon administration, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate induced a reduction of total bile acid level. Also, it was confirmed that glucagon enhances the uptake of taurocholate into freshly isolated rat hepatocytes by activating Na(+)-dependent, carrier-mediated membrane transport system and observed that its effect is associated with elevation of Vmax (0.6114 nmol.min-1 x 10(6) cells-1 without glucagon; 0.975 nmol.min-1 x 10(6) cells-1 in glucagon added) but not with affecting Km (13.58 mumol/L without glucagon; 13.71 mumol/L with glucagon) or protein synthesis which is inhibited by cycloheximide. These observations suggest that glucagon enhances Na(+)-coupled membrane transport of bile acids in the liver and causes the reduction of serum total bile acid level and that a lack of this response may be indicative of membrane dysfunction in the liver. \nChimeric BCR-abl messenger RNA as a marker for minimal residual disease in patients transplanted for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We correlated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-detectable BCR-abl fusion transcripts with cytogenetic status in 24 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Of 10 Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) patients, only one was found to exhibit a BCR-abl fusion transcript. Fourteen patients with Ph+ ALL, including eight in clinical remission, exhibited PCR-detectable BCR-abl rearrangements. A detectable Ph chromosome was present in only five of the eight patients in clinical remission. Of the three cytogenetically negative, BCR-abl-positive patients, two eventually succumbed to post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) relapse. The third died of early transplant complications. Serial PCR analyses were performed on four Ph+ ALL patients in clinical remission who underwent allogeneic BMT. One patient who was PCR negative on post-BMT days 21 and 75 became PCR-positive on day 116 and died in relapse on day 154. One patient was weakly positive for BCR-abl on day 23, negative on day 56, but died of transplant complications on day 124. Two patients exhibited no post-BMT BCR-abl rearrangements and remain well on days 279 and 371. Our findings suggest that PCR analysis may be useful in the early identification of relapse in patients transplanted for Ph+ ALL. \nBilateral internal mammary artery grafts in reoperative and primary coronary bypass surgery Bilateral internal mammary artery grafting is recognized as a preferred method of myocardial revascularization. However, its efficacy in coronary bypass reoperation has not been clearly established. From January 1982 through June 1989, 88 patients underwent coronary bypass reoperation with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts. Results were compared with those for a subset of 88 patients receiving primary revascularization with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts who were computer matched for sex, age, left ventricular function, anginal classification, and left main coronary artery disease. In each group, 62.5% (55 patients) had unstable angina, 43.2% (38 patients) had reduced ejection fraction, and 21.6% (19 patients) in the reoperation group and 20.5% (18 patients) in the reference group had left main coronary artery disease. Hospital mortality for the reoperation group was 6.8% (6 patients) and for the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients). No significant difference was found in the incidence of reoperation for bleeding, sternal infection, or stroke in the two groups. The incidence of respiratory insufficiency in the reoperation group was 13.6% (12 patients) and in the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients) (p less than 0.015). Recurrent angina occurred in 13.7% (10 patients) of patients in the reoperation group and 13.3% (10 patients) in the reference group. The long-term survival at 5 years for the reoperation group was 85.3% +/- 5.6% (+/- standard error of the mean) and for the reference group, 91.6% +/- 3.1%. No significant difference was found in the equality of survival distribution for the two groups. \nOccurrence of neoplasia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis enrolled in a DMARD Registry. Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine Registry Steering Committee. The Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine Registry (RAAR) was established in 1982 to examine the safety of azathioprine (AZA) and other disease modifying agents (DMARD) in the treatment of RA. In yearly followup over the past 7 years, 20 malignant conditions have been reported in 530 DMARD treated adult patients with RA. Incidence density ratios (IDR) and standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were calculated to assess cancer risk. For all cancers the SMR was 1.52 (95% CI 0.90-2.60). For men the SMR was 1.71 (95% CI 0.84-3.52); for women the SMR was 1.52 (95% CI 0.89-2.60). Adjusted for age, the IDR was highest in the 70-79-year-old study population (3.41). The age and sex adjusted SMR for lymphoproliferative disorders and myeloma was 8.05 (95% CI 3.30-20.81). The SMR for lung cancer (n = 6) was also increased (3.37; 95% CI 1.58-7.34). Compared with the general population, patients with RA requiring DMARD therapy may be at increased risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders. The RAAR is an important prospective technique which will ultimately permit assessment of neoplasia risk by type and duration of DMARD therapy. \nAdenosine in myocardial perfusion imaging using positron emission tomography. Because of its unique ability to demonstrate the metabolic consequences of myocardial ischemia, positron emission tomography (PET) is extremely valuable in assessing myocardial viability. PET imaging can identify the myocardial segments that are likely to improve after revascularization and may be more sensitive and specific for the detection of coronary artery disease compared with thallium perfusion imaging. Adenosine has several advantages over dipyridamole as a pharmacologic stress agent for use with PET. It produces maximal vasodilation in a significantly greater percentage of patients, is a more potent coronary vasodilator, and its very short half-life may be ideal for use with the very short half-life radioactive tracers used in PET. When combined with metabolic studies, adenosine may be useful for the assessment of patients who received thrombolytic therapy for an acute myocardial infarction. \nColovesical fistula secondary to vesical gangrene in a diabetic patient. We present a case of colovesical fistula secondary to vesical gangrene. Precipitating factors were diabetes and vesical distension caused by the obstruction of an indwelling catheter. This complication is an exceptional outcome in gangrenous cystitis and it requires emergency surgical treatment. \nBeneficial effect of the atrial natriuretic factor analog A68828 in postischemic acute renal failure. Short-term administration of atrial peptides has been reported to improve renal function in several animal models of acute renal failure. We designed experiments that determined the effect of a 13-amino acid analog of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), A68828, on renal function in the postischemic model of acute renal failure. Experiments were conducted using euvolemic, male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) under Inactin anesthesia. Acute renal failure was induced by complete occlusion of both renal arteries for 30 min. After release of the clamp, vehicle (0.1% bovine serum albumin in saline), A68828 (3, 10 or 30 micrograms/kg/min), dopamine (10 micrograms/kg/min), A68828 (10 micrograms/kg/min) plus dopamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) or ANF (1-28) (0.5 micrograms/kg/min) were infused i.v. for a 2-h period. A68828 at 10 micrograms/kg/min produced a significant increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared with vehicle controls (0.39 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g; P less than .05) despite a lower arterial pressure (87 +/- 5 vs. 101 +/- 5 mm Hg; P less than .05). A subpressor dose of dopamine had no effect on GFR during the postischemic period (0.25 +/- 0.11 ml/min/100 g). Dopamine in combination with A68828 prevented the decrease in arterial pressure seen with A68828 alone but did not potentiate the beneficial effects on GFR (0.28 +/- 0.05 ml/min/100 g). ANF (1-28) at 0.5 micrograms/kg/min increased GFR to levels nearly identical to those induced by A68828 (0.40 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g). These results indicate that infusion of a reduced-size analog of ANF improves renal function in the immediate postischemic period. Furthermore, prevention of the hypotensive effects of the analog with dopamine provides no additional beneficial effect. \nClear cell cribriform hyperplasia of the prostate. Immunohistochemical and DNA flow cytometric study. Clear cell cribriform hyperplasia (CCCH) of the prostate is an unusual form of benign prostatic hyperplasia characterized by a nodular proliferation of clear cells with small, uniform nuclei. The authors studied 15 cases of CCCH by immunohistochemistry and 13 of them by DNA flow cytometry to establish the immunohistochemical and DNA profile of this lesion. Patients ranged in age from 58 to 88 years (mean, 68 years). Follow-up of a mean of 22 months showed all patients alive with no evidence of malignant prostatic disease. All 13 CCCHs showed diploid DNA content; in contrast, among 4 papillary/cribriform carcinomas of the prostate used for comparison, 3 were aneuploid and 1 was diploid. A basal cell layer was demonstrated in all 15 CCCHs by the use of the 34 beta E12 anti-high-molecular-weight keratin antibody (EAB-903) that reacts with the basal cells but not with the acinar cells of the prostate. A continuous basal cell layer was not evident in the carcinomas. The blandness of the epithelium, the well-defined nodular configuration, the presence of a basal cell layer demonstrable by immunocytochemistry, and the lack of aneuploidy as determined by DNA flow cytometry together lend support to the concept that CCCH is a benign lesion. \nCramp-fasciculation syndrome: a treatable hyperexcitable peripheral nerve disorder. We report nine patients with muscle aching, cramps, stiffness, exercise intolerance, and peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Neurologic examination showed calf fasciculations in seven, quadriceps myokymia in two, and deltoid myokymia in one patient. Two patients had mild increase in serum creatine kinase. Muscle biopsy showed either no abnormality (three patients) or mild neurogenic changes (four patients). Fasciculations were the only abnormality on routine electrodiagnostic studies. Supramaximal stimulation of the median, ulnar, peroneal, and posterior tibial nerves at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 Hz produced showers of electrical potentials following the M response in at least one nerve. In three patients, the fasciculations and evoked electrical potentials were abolished by regional application of curare but not nerve block. Carbamazepine therapy caused moderate-to-marked reduction of symptoms and nerve hyperexcitability. We designate this hyperexcitable peripheral nerve disorder as the \"cramp-fasciculation syndrome.\". \nAcid peptic disease in adolescents. How to avoid misdiagnosis and undertreatment. Acid peptic disease in adolescents may be more common than previously recognized. However, appropriate medical attention is often delayed because of misdiagnosis and undertreatment. Thorough questioning of adolescent patients is important to elicit a complete description of symptoms. Endoscopy or intraluminal pH monitoring may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer. Therapy with histamine receptor antagonists, especially ranitidine (Zantac), is recommended. Antireflux surgery may be needed to prevent potential long-term gastrointestinal damage. Patients with duodenal ulcer should also be advised to make life-style changes to avoid recurrence of disease later in life. \nRegimen compliance two years after myocardial infarction. Two-years postinfarction, the effect of a nursing intervention at 30 days postinfarction, and intentions, attitudes, and perceived beliefs of others on regimen compliance of myocardial infarction patients was investigated. The sample was comprised of 51 patients (E = 29, C = 22) who participated in a five-phase study over 2 years. No differences were found between experimental and control groups for regimen compliance to activity, stress, and medication prescriptions. The experimental group was significantly more compliant to the diet prescription than the control group. The control group was significantly more compliant than the experimental group with cessation from smoking. Perceived beliefs of others were predictive of compliance for all regimen prescriptions at 2 years. Attitude was also predictive of compliance with the diet, smoking, and stress regimens. \nAllergic reactions to long-term benzathine penicillin prophylaxis for rheumatic fever. International Rheumatic Fever Study Group. 1790 patients from 11 countries were enrolled in a prospective international study to determine the incidence of allergic reactions to monthly intramuscular benzathine penicillin (penicillin G benzathine) injections to prevent recurrences of rheumatic fever. After 32,430 injections during 2736 patient years of observation, 57 of the 1790 patients (3.2%) had an allergic reaction. 4 had anaphylaxis, an incidence of 0.2% (1.2/10,000 injections), all in patients over 12 years of age, and 1 patient died, a fatality incidence of 0.05% (0.31/10,000 injections). These rates are similar to those described for patients without rheumatic fever who receive short-term treatment with parenteral penicillin. Rheumatic fever recurred in 8 of 1790 patients (0.45%) who received benzathine penicillin prophylaxis compared with 11 of 96 (11.5%) who did not comply with treatment. Life-threatening allergic reactions are rare in patients on long-term parenteral benzathine penicillin to prevent recurrences of rheumatic fever; the long-term benefits of such prophylaxis by far outweigh the risk of a serious allergic reaction. \nBlood flow reactivity to hypercapnia in strictly unilateral carotid disease: preliminary results. To show relationship between degree of carotid arterial stenosis and cerebral blood flow reactivity (RES%) to induced hypercapnia, fluorine-18-fluoromethane and positron emission tomography (PET) was used to study 18 patients with carotid distribution transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), all free of stroke, who had angiographic-proven unilateral arterial disease. Non-involved carotid arteries were either normal or had non-stenotic plaque. Either normal arteries or nonstenotic ulcerations in the symptomatic carotid arteries were present in five of 18 (28%), ipsilateral carotid stenosis from 50-99% was present in eight of 18 (44%), and ipsilateral internal carotid occlusion was present in five of 18 (28%) patients. In comparison with 14 normal controls, all patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow territories had significantly lower mean (SEM) RES% [5.0' (0.2) vs 4.0 (0.9), p less than 0.04]. Symptomatic anterior borderzone (ABZ) RES% was also significantly lower [4.6 (0.4) vs 3.3 (0.9), p less than 0.04], than controls. In patient subgroup comparisons, the 50-99% stenosis subgroup clearly had the lowest MCA RES% [3.4 (0.2)] as well as the lowest ABZ RES% [2.8 (0.4)] on their symptomatic sides. Age, expired pCO2, mean arterial blood pressure, serum glucose, serum haematocrit and number, type and estimated duration of TIAs were not significantly different between subgroups. Linear regression showed a significant relationship between RES% and both measured percentage-stenosis (p = 0.04) and residual luminal diameter (p = 0.05) in symptomatic MCA territories. This approached significance in symptomatic ABZ regions. This preliminary data set suggests that unilateral carotid stenosis can and does result in impaired CO2 reactivity following hypercapnia. \nProtein kinase C is involved in PTH-induced homologous desensitization by directly affecting PTH receptor in the osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells. We have investigated mechanisms of PTH-induced homologous desensitization reflected in the refractoriness of cAMP response to the second exposure to PTH in the clonal rat osteosarcoma cell line, UMR-106. Preincubation with 10(-7) M rat (r) PTH-(1-34) for 6 h caused the desensitization, resulting in a 65% decrease in cAMP accumulation in response to further exposure to rPTH. This desensitization was apparent at 10(-10) M rPTH and maximal at 10(-7) M rPTH. UMR-106 cells treated with protein kinase C (PK-C) activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10(-6) M) for 6 h also induced desensitization manifested by a loss of rPTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation to 50% of that in the control cells. On the other hand, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, incapable of activating PK-C, failed to induce desensitization. Fifty micromolar H-7 (PK-C inhibitor) significantly blocked both rPTH- and PMA-induced desensitization. Thus, PK-C seemed to play a major role in rPTH-induced desensitization. Pretreatment with neither rPTH nor PMA changed the cAMP responsiveness to 10 micrograms/ml cholera toxin or 100 microM forskolin. Islet activating protein failed to influence the desensitization in this cell line. PTH receptor binding, assessed by using 125I-labeled [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]PTH-(1-34) as a radioligand, was decreased along with PTH receptor numbers by pretreatment with rPTH or PMA. These data indicate that rPTH-induced homologous desensitization occurs at least in part through the activation of PK-C and that PK-C directly affects PTH receptor in UMR-106 cells. \nThe benefit of the Hemonetics cell saver apparatus during cardiac surgery. This retrospective chart review of 155 patients having coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) over a two-month period determined whether the use of a cell saver apparatus (CSA) (1) reduced or increased the requirements for homologous blood; (2) increased the incidence of post-surgical bleeding; (3) was cost-effective. Two groups of patients were identified. Group 1 (n = 99) received both CSA processed red blood cells and homologous blood components. Requirement for homologous blood products was reduced in the first 24 hr after surgery (0.5 +/- 1.0 vs 1.3 +/- 1.8 units; P less than 0.05) when compared with Group 2 (n = 56) in whom only homologous blood products were utilized. More patients in Group 1 had no transfusion requirements (45 vs 8; P less than 0.05) and there was no increased risk of major haemorrhage. When the capital costs are included, utilization of the CSA was not cost-effective. We conclude that utilisation of a CSA was safe, with no increased risk of bleeding, reduced requirements for homologous blood transfusions, but added to the cost of the procedure. \nAbnormal responses to orthostatic testing in children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope. Syncope in the pediatric age group is a frequent event. Most often the cause is readily apparent--i.e., orthostatic hypotension or a vasovagal event. However, there are a large number of children with frequent recurrent unexplained syncope. Neither history, physical examination, nor standard testing reveals a cause. One hundred four consecutive patients were evaluated by orthostatic testing after standard methods found no cause for the recurrent syncope. Forty-seven (44%) of these 104 patients had syncope produced by orthostatic testing. Twenty-six of the 47 (55%) became syncopal within 5 minutes of testing initiation and 21 of the 47 (45%) after 5 to 11 minutes of testing. These patients had an average decrease of 81.5 mm Hg in blood pressure and a 25 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Of 12 control subjects, none lost consciousness with standing times as long as 14 minutes. Pacing was ineffective in preventing syncope, as two patients with a previously implanted normally functioning pacemaker had recurrent syncope clinically. Syncope was also induced by orthostatic testing, with the pacemaker showing a normal response with pacing as the patient became bradycardic. The syncopal event produced by orthostatic testing occurred with a downward blood pressure trend and a narrowing of the pulse pressure without a significant increase in heart rate. This was followed by a sudden drop in blood pressure and then by bradycardia. There is a group of children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope due to abnormal orthostatic control mechanisms. Orthostatic testing appears helpful in identifying these patients. \nLumbar epidural diamorphine following thoracic surgery. A comparison of infusion and bolus administration. Twenty-two patients received a single dose of diamorphine 5 mg through a lumbar epidural catheter before thoracic surgery. The patients were transferred after surgery to a high dependency unit where they were allocated randomly to receive either an infusion of epidural diamorphine at a rate of 1 mg/hour (group 1) or bolus doses of epidural diamorphine 5 mg on demand (group 2). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in visual analogue pain scores in the first 18 postoperative hours. Arterial carbon dioxide tension was elevated in both groups and was consistently higher in group 1 than in group 2, with a statistically significant intergroup difference 12 hours after operation. Respiratory rate was not a useful index of respiratory depression. The commonest nonrespiratory side effect was urinary retention, but the incidences of this and other minor side effects were similar in the two groups. \nCarcinoma of the prostate: MR images obtained with body coils do not accurately reflect tumor volume. MR imaging with a body coil is unreliable in directly demonstrating tumor spread through the prostatic capsule. However, the likelihood of extracapsular spread of prostatic cancer rises with increasing tumor volume. The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy of MR with a body coil in diagnosing capsular penetration indirectly via an estimation of prostatic tumor volumes. Twenty-six patients with proved prostatic cancer that was clinically confined to the gland underwent MR imaging before radical prostatectomy and whole-mount pathologic sectioning of the specimen. Twenty of 31 lesions prospectively outlined on the MR images corresponded to cancers outlined on the pathology slides, and tumor volumes were calculated by using a voxel summation technique. On MR, tumor volume was underestimated in 11 of 20 cases and overestimated in nine of 20 cases. Only two of 20 size estimates based on MR findings were within 10% of actual tumor volume. Overlap in MR tumor volumes was significant between lesions with and without capsular penetration at microscopy. Factors contributing to inaccuracies in measurements of tumor volume on MR images included the variable histologic make-up of the tumors. Our results show that, although knowledge of the size of a prostatic lesion is important in predicting the behavior of the tumor, MR imaging with a body coil is not reliable for accurate estimation of tumor volume. \nPurification of parathyroid hypertensive factor from plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Parathyroid hypertensive factor (PHF) is a newly described hypertensive factor that may be related to elevation of blood pressure in 30-40% of North American essential hypertensive patients. PHF is also found in several animal models of hypertension, including spontaneously hypertensive rats, and deoxycorticosterone acetate salt hypertensive rats. Plasma collected from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was used in the present study for purification of PHF. Plasma was dialyzed at a molecular mass cutoff of 1 kDa, and then ultrafiltered at a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa. PHF activity, as determined by bioassay (characteristic delayed hypertensive response in normotensive rat) was retained in the fraction that was greater than 1 kDa and less than 5 kDa. Dialyzed and ultrafiltered SHR plasma was fractionated by molecular-exclusion chromatography, either with Bio-Gel P-6 liquid chromatography, or TSK 2000 SW HPLC. The biological activity was detected in a discrete region corresponding to a molecular mass of 2.5-3 kDa. When the molecular-exclusion fraction was subsequently fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC, biological activity was located in a single discrete peak, which did not occur in plasma from normotensive rats prepared in a similar manner. The biologically active fraction of PHF was inactivated by trypsin; this and its UV spectrum indicate the presence of a peptide structure. \nNasal schwannoma. A 36-year-old man with a nasal septal mass is presented. The diagnosis of a benign neoplasm arising from peripheral nerve Schwann cells was made by excisional biopsy. A benign nerve sheath tumor may be either a schwannoma or neurofibroma. Schwannomas may be distinguished from neurofibroma by clinical and histologic criteria. Malignant degeneration and intracranial extension may complicate the course of a nasal schwannoma. Complete excision is the preferred therapy. \nEssential fatty acid deficiency associated with the use of a medium-chain-triglyceride infant formula in pediatric hepatobiliary disease. Serum phospholipid fatty acid patterns were determined by gas chromatography in four infants with hepatobiliary disease receiving a formula with a high content of medium-chain-triglyceride (MCT) oil. All four infants demonstrated signs of essential fatty acid deficiency, characterized by decreased arachidonic acid and increased palmitoleic and oleic acids. All had substantial concentrations of the pathologic triene 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid. Three of four had decreased linoleic acid concentrations and abnormal ratios of triene to tetraene (5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid: arachidonic acid), greater than 0.38. One patient may have experienced growth failure due to abnormal essential fatty acid status. Infants with the potential for fat malabsorption should only receive MCT-oil feedings with well above the generally recommended requirements for linoleic acid (3% of total caloric intake). \nPostoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia. A technique for relief of postoperative pain following major extremity surgery. A new technique using postoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia (PICRA) for postoperative pain relief was investigated in 23 surgical patients treated by amputation (12 patients) or by limb-salvage resection operations (11 patients). Bupivacaine was delivered into peripheral nerve sheaths via catheters placed therein at the time of surgery. Only patients in whom the nerves were easily accessible were treated. Catheters were placed in the axillary sheath, the lumbosacral trunk, and the femoral nerve sheaths of patients treated with shoulder girdle and pelvic procedures (resections and amputations), and within the sciatic nerve sheath of those treated with lower extremity procedures. The anesthetic agent was delivered at controllable rates. Regional analgesia was obtained in the operative site with minimal motor or sensory decrease. To assess the efficacy of this technique, the results of this study group were compared with those of a matched group of 11 patients treated with similar surgical procedures but who received epidural morphine. Eleven of the 23 patients on PICRA required no supplemental narcotic agents. The mean level of the narcotic agents required by the remaining 13 PICRA patients was approximately one third of that required by the matched group of 11 patients receiving epidural morphine. Overall, the patients on PICRA had an 80% reduction of narcotic requirements when compared to the historical controls. The technique is reliable and can be performed by the surgeon, requiring about a ten-minute increase in operating time. It has potentially wide application in orthopedics in procedures in which the major nerves are easily accessible (e.g., pelvic fractures and revision hip surgery) and for patients with intractable pain of the extremities. \nExtracellular binding sites of IgA anti-jejunal antibodies on normal small bowel detected by indirect immunoelectronmicroscopy. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) have IgA deposition in the papillary dermis and in the lamina propria of the small bowel. In addition, most of DH patients' sera contain IgA class anti-reticulin antibodies, anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA), and anti-jejunal antibodies (JAB) during times of gluten intake. In previous studies, JAB and EMA seemed to be identical and related to the group of anti-reticulin antibodies. In the present study, pre-embedding en bloc immunoelectronmicroscopic methods were applied for analysis of the ultrastructural binding sites of JAB on monkey and rabbit small bowels. These substrates were incubated with sera from DH patients strongly positive for JAB. Simultaneous investigations with the PAP technique and with 5 nm gold-labeled protein A or second antibodies visualized the bound IgA identically: it was associated with collagen fibrils underlying the epithelial and cryptal basement membranes and with collagen fibrils around capillaries. Staining was also detected along the endomysial collagen fibrils of smooth muscle layers, around elastica and smooth muscle cells of blood vessel walls, and along collagen fibrils near smooth muscle cells in the lamina propria. Neither the peroxidase product nor gold deposition was detected directly on the fibers, but was associated with amorphous material surrounding collagen fibers of different diameters. The distribution of JAB-stained structures corresponded to the localization of reticulin network of the small bowel. Our data indicate that JAB recognize an antigen or antigens associated with an amorphous component of the reticulin-collagen structure of jejunum and may have identical binding sites, as anti-reticulin antibodies and EMA. \nAmenorrhoea in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease. Amenorrhoea is common in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease, but little is known about its causes or consequences. We investigated 12 young women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease and amenorrhoea and compared them with 11 healthy age matched controls studied in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. None of the patients had raised serum concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone suggesting primary gonadal failure, but the variance in serum concentrations of testosterone, oestradiol, prolactin, and luteinising hormone were significantly greater in chronic liver disease patients than control subjects (p less than 0.01). Seven of the 12 chronic liver disease patients had low serum luteinising hormone concentrations, and compared with controls these patients also had significantly reduced median values of oestradiol (64 pmol/l), testosterone (1.1 nmol/l), and follicle stimulating hormone, and were significantly underweight as assessed by skinfold thickness measurements (all comparisons p less than 0.025). In the group with chronic liver disease skinfold thickness was significantly correlated with serum luteinising hormone (p less than 0.02). The five patients with normal serum luteinising hormone had higher median values of both oestradiol (237 pmol/l) and testosterone (3.0 nmol/l) than the control subjects (oestradiol: 113 pmol/l, testosterone: 1.9 nmol/l) but were not more obese or hirsute. Amenorrhoea was unrelated to the duration or severity of liver disease. The metacarpal cortical bone area (an index of bone density) was inversely related to the duration of amenorrhoea (p less than 0.02). We conclude that amenorrhoea in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease arises from hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction and can occur at any stage. \nComputer-assisted superimposition of magnetic resonance and high-resolution technetium-99m-HMPAO and thallium-201 SPECT images of the brain. A method for registering three-dimensional CT, MR, and PET data sets that require no special patient immobilization or other precise positioning measures was adapted to high-resolution SPECT and MRI and was applied in 14 subjects (five normal volunteers, four patients with dementia (Alzheimer's disease), two patients with recurrent glioblastoma, and three patients with focal lesions (stroke, arachnoid cyst and head trauma]. T2-weighted axial magnetic resonance images and transaxial 99mTc-HMPAO and 201Tl images acquired with an annular gamma camera were merged using an objective registration (translation, rotation and rescaling) program. In the normal subjects and patients with dementia and focal lesions, focal areas of high uptake corresponded to gray matter structures. Focal lesions observed on MRI corresponded to perfusion defects on SPECT. In the patients who had undergone surgical resection of glioblastoma followed by interstitial brachytherapy, increased 201Tl corresponding to recurrent tumor could be localized from the superimposed images. The method was evaluated by measuring the residuals in all subjects and translational errors due to superimposition of deep structures in the 12 subjects with normal thalamic anatomy and 99mTc-HMPAO uptake. This method for superimposing magnetic resonance and high-resolution SPECT images of the brain is a useful technique for correlating regional function with brain anatomy. \nSurvival of patients with dementia. The evidence on survival in dementia is summarized. There are no reliable data on survival after onset of dementia or after first contact with medical services. People with dementia in outpatient clinics and nursing homes have 2-year survival rates of 75% (range 60%-95%) and 50% (range 30%-65%), respectively. Differences in survival between patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT) and multi infarct dementia (MID) are small. Women in nursing homes have a better prognosis than men (2-year survival rates, 60% vs 40%). Dementia patients have a considerable excess mortality when compared to the vital statistics. There is no evidence for improvement of survival rates during recent decades. Recommendations for future studies are made. \nPercutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty of lesions not ideal for balloon angioplasty BACKGROUND. Excimer laser coronary angioplasty is a new, investigational technique for treating coronary artery stenoses. Initial reports have demonstrated acute efficacy and relative safety of this procedure, but have not addressed the effect of lesion type on acute success and complication rates. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the first 100 patients undergoing percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty at our institution, acute laser success was obtained in 84% and procedural success was obtained in 94%. There were six acute closures during laser angioplasty and one myocardial infarction. Two patients required emergency coronary bypass surgery. Sixty-five percent of patients had lesions not ideal for balloon angioplasty because of lesion morphology (tubular, diffuse, or chronic total occlusion) or ostial location. There were 10 tubular stenoses, 29 diffuse lesions, 18 chronic total occlusions, and eight ostial lesions, including five aorto-ostial lesions. In this nonideal subgroup, the acute success rate with laser was 86% (72% of chronic total occlusions and 91% of non-totally occluded lesions), and the procedural success rate was 94%. There were three acute occlusions during laser angioplasty but no myocardial infarctions, emergency bypass surgeries, or deaths. One coronary artery perforation occurred without clinical sequelae. Laser angioplasty was successful in four of six lesions (67%) in which balloon angioplasty had failed. Laser success was obtained in 10 of 11 (91%) moderately or heavily calcified stenoses. Eight eccentric lesions and two lesions on bends were successfully treated without dissection or perforation. No side branch occlusions occurred in the 15 patients in whom one or more major branches originated within the lesion treated. Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed in 47% of cases, usually to obtain a larger final luminal diameter. Need for adjunctive balloon angioplasty decreased to 36% after a larger (2.0 mm) laser catheter became available. Twenty-eight percent of the 105 lesions treated were American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification type A, 47% were type B, and 25% were type C. Laser and procedural successes were obtained in 83% and 97% of type A, 88% and 96% of type B, and 85% and 88% of type C lesions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. In our initial experience, excimer laser angioplasty was found to be acutely effective and safe therapy for lesions identified as not ideal for balloon angioplasty. This technique may provide a useful adjunct or alternative to balloon angioplasty in selected patients. \nThe postmenopausal adnexal mass: correlation between ultrasonic and pathologic findings. One hundred two postmenopausal women underwent ultrasonographic evaluation of adnexal masses before surgery. Twenty-nine (28%) had malignant tumors and 73 (72%) had benign tumors. Two of 33 patients with a \"simple cyst\" smaller than 5 cm in diameter by ultrasound had malignant ovarian tumors. Twenty-two of the 52 women (42%) with \"complex masses\" by ultrasound and five of the 17 (29%) with solid tumors had ovarian cancer. For predicting malignancy in ovarian tumors, abdominal ultrasonography had a positive predictive value of 39% and a negative predictive value of 94%. If a negative sonogram had been relied upon, 6% of malignant ovarian tumors in postmenopausal women might have been missed. \nA comparison of enalapril with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure BACKGROUND. To define better the efficacy of vasodilator therapy in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure, we compared the effects of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate with those of enalapril in 804 men receiving digoxin and diuretic therapy for heart failure. The patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive 20 mg of enalapril daily or 300 mg of hydralazine plus 160 mg of isosorbide dinitrate daily. The latter regimen was identical to that used with a similar patient population in the effective-treatment arm of our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial. RESULTS. Mortality after two years was significantly lower in the enalapril arm (18 percent) than in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arm (25 percent) (P = 0.016; reduction in mortality, 28.0 percent), and overall mortality tended to be lower (P = 0.08). The lower mortality in the enalapril arm was attributable to a reduction in the incidence of sudden death, and this beneficial effect was more prominent in patients with less severe symptoms (New York Heart Association class I or II). In contrast, body oxygen consumption at peak exercise was increased only by hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate treatment (P less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction, which increased with both regimens during the 2 years after randomization, increased more (P less than 0.05) during the first 13 weeks in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate group. CONCLUSIONS. The similar two-year mortality in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arms in our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (26 percent) and in the present trial (25 percent), as compared with that in the placebo arm in the previous trial, (34 percent) and the further survival benefit with enalapril in the present trial (18 percent) strengthen the conclusion that vasodilator therapy should be included in the standard treatment for heart failure. The different effects of the two regimens (enalapril and hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate) on mortality and physiologic end points suggest that the profile of effects might be enhanced if the regimens were used in combination. \nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation. Five patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation are reported. Four had severe clinical symptoms, whereas 1 was asymptomatic. Mechanical ventilatory support was necessary in 1 because of respiratory distress. Pneumocystis carinii infection developed in 4 patients within the first 4 postoperative months, and 1 patient had clinical disease 1 year after transplantation with a recurrence 9 months later. All were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole either orally or intravenously (10 to 20 mg.kg-1.day-1 of trimethoprim). All patients recovered from infection and received the same drug prophylactically for 2 to 20 months after the infection. All patients are doing well after Pneumocystis carinii infection except 1 who died after an acute myocardial infarction 4 years after infection. We conclude that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an effective agent for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation. \nDetection of single copies of Epstein-Barr virus in paraffin wax sections by non-radioactive in situ hybridisation. A highly sensitive non-isotopic in situ hybridisation technique was developed for the localisation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in paraffin wax embedded tissue sections. The method uses a repeated sequence of the EBV genome as a probe, labelled with the novel reporter molecule, digoxigenin. The method can identify individual copies of EBV by detection of both EBV DNA and highly localised RNA transcripts. A combination of careful proteolytic digestion of tissue sections, high temperature denaturation of probe and target DNA, and sensitive immunocytochemical detection are used to attain single copy sensitivity. The technique is quicker and simpler to perform than some other methods used for the identification of EBV, and provides simultaneous morphological information which cannot be obtained by methods using tissue extracts. This method permits the investigation of the role of EBV in neoplastic conditions of lymphoid and epithelial cells, and may prove valuable in determining the sites of latent virus in healthy subjects. \nIntrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis: case report. The authors present a case of intrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis. Computed tomography with metrizamide myelography proved valuable in locating the lesion, thus facilitating surgical intervention. With the preoperative diagnosis established and the severity of the meningocele known, the surgeons safely employed a subpleural approach at thoracotomy. \nMechanism of cyclosporine-induced hypertension. Cyclosporine is a common immunosuppressive agent used in solid organ and bone marrow transplants and the treatment of some immunological diseases. It has been established that treatment with cyclosporine can cause a patient to develop hypertension within a few weeks of treatment. This review will examine this effect and effective ways to treat it. \nMucosal and systemic IgA anti-gliadin antibody in celiac disease. Contrasting patterns of response in serum, saliva, and intestinal secretions. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody estimation is a recognized screening method for celiac disease. However, celiac disease is primarily a small intestinal mucosal disorder, and so we have examined the possibility that secreted, mucosal IgA anti-gliadin antibody might provide a more relevant measure of gluten sensitivity than that obtained from serum tests. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody and serum, salivary, and small intestinal aspirate IgA anti-gliadin antibody were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IgA and IgG anti-gliadin antibody were markedly increased in untreated celiacs (N = 31) as compared to normals (N = 20) or disease controls (N = 39) (P less than 0.0001). Levels were lower in treated (N = 30) than untreated celiacs (P less than 0.001). In intestinal aspirates both untreated and treated patients had similar levels of IgA anti-gliadin antibody (P = 0.48), but both were significantly higher than in controls (P less than 0.01). Salivary IgA anti-gliadin antibody, by contrast, was not increased in celiac patients as compared to controls. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody was the most sensitive (84%) and specific (95%) test for detecting untreated celiac disease. It was also the most useful in patient follow-up where it provides an early objective indicator of adherence to a gluten-free diet. Mucosal IgA responses to gliadin in celiac disease appear to be compartmentalized, with different portions of the gastrointestinal tract functioning as separate immunological organs. Our results also demonstrate that serum and secretory IgA production are under independent control. \nIntraaortic balloon pumping as the postangioplasty strategy in acute myocardial infarction. To assess the usefulness of intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 114 patients with anterior AMI undergoing emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery were studied. After successful PTCA 66 patients were treated with conventional therapy (group I), and 48 patients were treated with IABP for 25 +/- 8 hours (group II). The reocclusion rate was significantly lower in group II (2.4% vs 17.7% p less than 0.05). An increase in ejection fraction in group II compared with group I was marginally significant (4.5 +/- 12.2% vs 9.2 +/- 13.0%, p = 0.08). Vascular complications occurred in two patients, but there were no deaths from IABP. These results suggest that after successful PTCA for acute myocardial infarction, IABP prevents reocclusion and may add strength to reperfusion in the improvement of left ventricular function. \nIIB osteosarcoma. Current management and survival statistics in the USSR. Three hundred and ninety-three patients with IIB osteosarcoma were treated at the author's institution between 1955 and 1986. In the first stage of the study, 88 patients were treated with surgery only. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 7%. In the second stage of the study, the efficacy of preventive chemotherapy after radical surgery was studied in 55 patients. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 34.4%. In the third stage of the study, the efficacy of combination therapy consisting of preoperative treatment, limb-saving surgery, and preventive chemotherapy was studied in 66 patients. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 35.5%. The authors examined results in 21 patients with Grade IV responses to evaluate the relationship between prognosis and morphogenic changes after preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 57.9%. In the fourth stage of the study (conducted in 1986), two regimens of preoperative chemotherapy were initiated. The first regimen consists of intraarterial platinum infusions to patients with lower extremity bone damage. The second regimen consists of high-dose methotrexate infusions. The preliminary conclusion is that primary tumor damage is significantly more marked after intraarterial cisplatin infusion. \nSingle motor end-plates in myasthenia gravis and LEMS at different firing rates. The jitter and frequency of blocking was studied at single motor end-plates in 10 patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and in a patient with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), using single fiber EMG (SFEMG) with axonal microstimulation at rates varying from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz. While some myasthenic motor end-plates showed lowest degrees of transmission disturbance at the lowest rates and most pronounced abnormality at the highest rates of stimulation, over one-half were most abnormal at intermediate rates and improved at higher rates. In 1 patient, all end-plates behaved in this way. On the other hand, all end-plates in the LEMS patient showed the expected improvement of the abnormal jitter and blocking on increasing the stimulation rate. It is argued that improvement of jitter and blocking at higher rates, unless dramatic, does not necessarily suggest a presynaptic abnormality. \nTreatment of esophageal varices: low versus high dose of 5% ethanolamine oleate. Twenty-four patients, undergoing sclerotherapy for esophageal varices, were injected with 10-20 ml of ethanolamine oleate 5% in the first treatment session (group A). Fourteen patients were injected with 40 ml of the same sclerosant in the first session (group B). Retrospective analysis was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two doses. Variceal eradication was achieved in group B in significantly fewer sclerotherapy sessions. Rebleeding occurred in 16% of patients in group A, compared with no rebleeding in group B. There was no significant difference in the incidence of various complications. We conclude that the use of 40 ml of 5% ethanolamine oleate in the first session is more effective and as safe as the use of 20 ml of the same sclerosant. \nProarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death in young patients receiving encainide and flecainide. The Pediatric Electrophysiology Group The potential for proarrhythmic responses to the class IC sodium channel-blocking drugs encainide and flecainide has not been well described in young patients. Therefore, data were retrospectively collected from 36 institutions regarding 579 young patients who were administered encainide or flecainide for treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (encainide 86 patients, flecainide 369 patients) or ventricular arrhythmias (encainide 21 patients, flecainide 103 patients) to assess the frequency of proarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death during therapy (adverse events). The two drugs were similar in regard to efficacy (flecainide 71.4%, encainide 59.8%) and rate of proarrhythmic responses (flecainide 7.4%; encainide 7.5%). However, patients receiving encainide more frequently experienced cardiac arrest (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.3%, p less than 0.05) or died during treatment (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.1%, p less than 0.05). Detailed data were provided for 44 patients experiencing one or more adverse events. Patient age, previous drug trials, concomitant therapy and days of inpatient monitoring were similar for patients receiving encainide or flecainide. However, echocardiographic left ventricular shortening before treatment was lower among patients receiving encainide (0.23 +/- 0.09) than among those receiving flecainide (0.34 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.05). Plasma drug concentrations were rarely elevated. Cardiac arrest (12 patients) and deaths (13 patients) occurred predominantly among patients with underlying heart disease, particularly among patients receiving flecainide for supraventricular tachycardia (8.3% vs. 0.3%, p less than 0.001). Fifteen patients with an ostensibly normal heart and normal ventricular function experienced proarrhythmia during treatment for supraventricular tachycardia, but only 3 of the 15 had a cardiac arrest or died. The relatively high incidence of adverse events should be considered when contemplating treatment with encainide or flecainide, particularly among patients with underlying heart disease. \nEffect of plasma glucose on infarct size in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Although hyperglycemia has been shown to consistently exacerbate ischemia brain injury following global or diffuse cerebral ischemia, the effect of hyperglycemia in unilateral focal cerebral ischemia remains controversial. Recent advances in thrombolytic therapy have enhanced the clinical significance of postischemic reperfusion. We studied the effect of plasma glucose on ischemic brain injury in a newly developed focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model. Rats allowed free access to food until ischemic insult developed intra- and postischemic hyperglycemia and cortical infarction. Rats fasted for 24 hours had blunted hyperglycemic responses. Infarct volumes were correspondingly smaller. The protective effect of fasting was partially abolished by glucose loading during ischemia to induce intra-ischemic hyperglycemia. Glucose loading immediately or 3 hours after focal cerebral ischemia did not significantly alter the protective effect of fasting. Insulin treatment in fed rats before ischemia also reduced hyperglycemic responses and infarct volume. Timing of insulin treatment was also critical in the reduction of ischemic injury. These findings indicate that plasma glucose during the period of ischemia is an important determinant of brain injury in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion and there is a therapeutic window for normalization of plasma glucose to be efficacious. \nThe role of albumin in human physiology and pathophysiology, Part III: Albumin and disease states. The serum albumin level is one of several clinical parameters of the status of general health. There is a marked correlation between low albumin levels and the incidence of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that hypoalbuminemia is a common finding among hospitalized patients. This results from alterations in the catabolic or anabolic rates, losses of albumin, or redistribution between the various fluid compartments of the body. Somewhat less well defined than the role of albumin as a prognostic indicator is its role in compounding pathophysiology. Hypoalbuminemia is known to be associated with delayed wound healing. The hypoalbuminemic state interferes with the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. Qualitative changes in the albumin molecule which occur in renal disease may damage the nephron. Low serum albumin levels may adversely affect the coagulation system. Further investigation into the role of albumin in pathophysiology is warranted. \nBlood pressure as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The Framingham Study--30 years of follow-up Data from 30 years of follow-up of the original Framingham Study cohort of 5,070 men and women aged 30-62 years who were first examined during the period 1948-1952 and who were free of cardiovascular disease reveal that blood pressure is a strong and consistent predictor of the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and congestive heart failure. Other factors related to blood pressure like obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy as demonstrated on electrocardiograms, and heart enlargement as shown by x-ray radiography made several selective additional independent contributions to risk; heart enlargement by x-ray radiography was the best predictor of congestive heart failure. \nCrohn's colitis complicated by superimposed invasive amebic colitis. The clinical characteristics and endoscopic appearance of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be very similar to those of amebic colitis. Physicians, especially in areas in which amebiasis is endemic, are familiar with this difficulty. Moreover, in individual cases, it may even be impossible to distinguish between the two conditions, since stool specimens, bowel biopsies, and serological studies may be negative for Entamoeba histolytica, even in the presence of invasive amebic colitis. Invasive amebiasis may rarely be superimposed on IBD, which further complicates the issue. We report here a young patient with a 7-yr history of Crohn's colitis proven histologically who developed invasive amebic colitis during steroid and 6-mercaptopurine treatment for active disease. Stool specimens, mucosal biopsies, and serological studies were negative for E. histolytica, and the diagnosis was established on pathological examination of a surgically resected bowel. Anti-amebic therapy should be considered in endemic areas in cases of persistent IBD. \nMalignant melanoma occurring in those aged under 30 in the west of Scotland 1979-1986: a study of incidence, clinical features, pathological features and survival. The study population consisted of the 95 patients who presented with cutaneous malignant melanoma in the west of Scotland between 1979 and 1986 and who were aged under 30 at the time of diagnosis. Over this 7-year period, 1299 melanomas were diagnosed in all age groups in this geographical area, increasing in incidence by 82% from 135 in 1979 to 246 in 1986. The proportion of melanomas diagnosed before the patients' thirtieth birthday remained constant at 6%. None were diagnosed in the under-15 age-group, and none developed on giant congenital naevi. Forty-two of the 95 melanomas (44%) in the under-30 group developed on a small naevus present either from birth or early childhood. These melanomas were thicker than those apparently developing on normal skin, but once controlled for tumour thickness and sex the presence of a pre-existing naevus did not affect 5-year survival. The overall 5-year survival was 76% with poorer survival associated with thicker tumours and male sex. This study suggests that small early onset naevi may have a higher potential for post-pubertal malignant change than has been previously recognized. \nHaemodynamic changes during the apnoea test for diagnosis of brain death. Haemodynamic responses to the apnoea test for the diagnosis of brain death were investigated in nine patients with severe head injury or cerebrovascular disease. To prove apnoea, the ventilator was disconnected for ten minutes and oxygen was insufflated to avoid hypoxaemia. No respiratory movement was seen in any patient. Ten minutes after disconnecting the ventilator, PaCO2 was increased to 78 +/- 3 mmHg and pH was reduced to 7.17 +/- 0.02. Adequate oxygenation was maintained in all patients. Cardiac output increased from 4.8 +/- 0.7 to 5.7 +/- 0.8 L.min-1 (P less than 0.05), and mean pulmonary artery pressure increased from 11 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01). However, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and right atrial pressure did not change. Plasma catecholamines were measured in three patients. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased in all three patients but the changes in plasma epinephrine were minimal. These circulatory responses to acute hypercapnia were less than those reported in awake volunteers and in patients during general anaesthesia. However, since plasma norepinephrine concentration increased during the test, some sympathoadrenal response, probably of spinal origin, was present, and may have prevented the direct depressant circulatory effects of acute hypercapnia. In conclusion, the apnoea test did not produce haemodynamic disturbances when respiratory acidosis was limited to a pH 7.17 +/- 0.02 and PaCO2 60-80 mmHg. \nTraumatic facial injuries with steering wheel loading. This study was conducted to evaluate the biomechanics of facial fractures caused by steering wheel loading. Twelve intact fresh human cadaver heads were impacted onto standard or energy-absorbing steering wheels with a custom-designed and validated vertical-drop apparatus. Either zygoma was impacted once at a velocity of 2.0-6.9 m/s. The specimens were oriented to permit a direct comparison between pretest and posttest radiography, and two-dimensional and three-dimensional CT images. Bone mineral content was determined, and biomechanical forces, accelerations, and deformations were recorded. More severe fractures were associated with higher forces on the zygoma. With increasing velocities, fractures initiated at the zygomatic region propagated to other unilateral regions such as the mandible and orbit or to the contralateral side. Less facial trauma was observed with energy-absorbing steering wheels compared with standard wheels at similar impact velocities. Bone mineral content did not correlate well with specimen age or with fracture severity. Clinically significant fractures were identifiable on 3-D CT images. The flexibility of 3-D CT in evaluating the spatial extent of facial abnormalities in different orientations may have significant impact in planning surgical procedures. \nErythropoietin concentrations in obstructive sleep apnoea. Eight patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and a normal haemoglobin concentration underwent nocturnal studies during which oxyhaemoglobin saturation was recorded continuously with an ear oximeter and serum erythropoietin concentration was measured hourly by means of a radioimmunoassay. Serum erythropoietin concentrations remained within the normal range throughout the study despite falls in oxyhaemaglobin saturation in individuals to 33-78%. There was no relation between the degree of nocturnal hypoxaemia and serum erythropoietin concentrations. The brief cyclical episodes of hypoxaemia typical of obstructive sleep apnoea may not be a sufficient stimulus for erythropoietin secretion. \nA frameless, armless navigational system for computer-assisted neurosurgery. Technical note. A computer-assisted neurosurgical navigational system has been developed which displays intraoperative manipulation on the preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance (MR) images. The system consists of a three-dimensional digitizer, a personal computer, and an image-processing unit. Utilizing recently developed magnetic field modulation technology, the three-dimensional digitizer determines the spatial position and orientation angles of the resin probe, triangle-shaped pointer, or suction tube with a small attached magnetic field sensor. Four fiducial markers on the scalp were used to translate the spatial data of the probe onto the preoperative CT scans or MR images of the patient. With this frameless, armless navigational system, CT or MR-imaging stereotaxy can be applied to conventional open neurosurgery without limiting the operative field or interfering with the surgical procedures. \nDiclofenac delays healing of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions. Double-blind, placebo-controlled endoscopic study in healthy volunteers. The effects of the water-soluble and delayed-release formulations of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, diclofenac, on the healing of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions were compared in a double-blind, double cross-over, placebo-controlled endoscopic study conducted in 14 healthy volunteers. Severe endoscopic lesions (petechiae, erosions, ulcers, and esophageal candidiasis) were found only in the group taking the soluble formulation of diclofenac (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). The endoscopic healing of biopsies at one week was delayed by both preparations in comparison to placebo (P less than 0.05 vs placebo). Neither formulation produced significantly more histological inflammation or minor endoscopic lesions (erythema, red striae) than placebo. Both formulations were equally well tolerated and produced no more symptoms than placebo. This study suggests that soluble diclofenac acts topically to delay gastroduodenal healing and produce gastroduodenal injury; it thus provides a model for future studies of the production, perpetuation, and healing of peptic lesions. \nProgressive congestive heart failure. Ways to approach office management. Treatment of congestive heart failure depends on the cause, precipitating factors, and symptoms of the disease in each patient. Dr Kahn outlines the use of the three main types of pharmacologic agents given for heart failure--diuretics, vasodilators, and digoxin. He describes a stepwise regimen, whereby agents are added as needed to improve symptoms and prolong life. \nCombined evaluation of total and functional liver plasma flows and intrahepatic shunting A diagnostic protocol was studied, designed to evaluate the main parameters of liver circulation in man. A water solution of D-sorbitol (S) and indocyanine green (ICG) was infused intravenously in six controls and nine cirrhotics. Steady-state renal and hepatic S clearances as well as hepatic ICG clearance were calculated. In controls the values (mean +/- SD) of the independent measurements of S and ICG hepatic clearance were 978 +/- 107 and 519 +/- 142 ml/min, respectively, while in cirrhotic patients they were 554 +/- 238 and 231 +/- 90 ml/min. Owing to the kinetic properties of S, its hepatic clearance may be regarded as a measure of functional liver plasma flow (FLPF). The total liver plasma flow (TLPF) values (mean +/- SD), calculated according to Fick's principle, were 1091 +/- 157 ml/min (S method) and 1033 +/- 153 ml/min (ICG method) in controls, and 1251 +/- 554 and 1284 +/- 677 ml/min in cirrhotics. In controls, FLPF was found to be very close to TLPF. In cirrhotic patients the difference between TLPF and FLPF (ranging from 169 to 2093 ml/min when measured by S method) was considered as an approximate estimate of intrahepatic shunting. The procedure is safe and simple and may add a new dimension to the investigation of hepatic circulation. \nTreatment of superior vena cava thrombosis with recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator. Thrombotic occlusion of the superior vena cava is an uncommon but serious complication of chronic indwelling venous catheters. Several reports have shown thrombolytic therapy with intravenous streptokinase or urokinase to be effective in the treatment of this condition. We report a case of superior vena cava thrombosis in a 53-year-old woman receiving chemotherapy for breast carcinoma through a subcutaneously implanted venous access catheter who was successfully treated with peripheral infusion of recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (rtPA). \nThe aphasic isolate. A clinical-CT scan study of a particularly severe subgroup of global aphasics. This paper outlines the clinical and CT scan features of a subtype of global aphasia, characterized by an extreme loss of communicative abilities, verbal as well as nonverbal. Three to four weeks after a left hemisphere stroke, 17 patients were completely unable to communicate with people addressing them. Though there were differences in their willingness to interact with the environment, they were characterized by complete loss of speech output and by inaccessibility to any kind of message, whether given verbally or through gestures. Patients who survived were reassessed 6 and 12 mos later and half of them were still found in a state of complete communicative isolation. The remainder had somewhat improved, but remained globally aphasic. The attempt to find a CT scan basis for this picture was disappointing. Only 35% of patients had a lesional pattern in agreement with the traditional view that ascribes global aphasia to the involvement of Broca's and Wernicke's areas. The location of lesion in the other cases spanned from anterior cortical damage, to posterior cortical damage, to deep nuclei damage and none of the lesions that have been proposed to account for subcortical global aphasia was consistently observed. \nClinical factors affecting the immediate outcome of PTCA in patients with unstable angina and poor candidates for surgery. Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has been successfully applied in unstable angina to carefully selected patients. In this study, PTCA was performed in 277 consecutive patients suffering from unstable angina and for whom bypass surgery was not a valid alternative because either of inoperable conditions or of emergency, or because surgery was not the best option. All patients were admitted first to the intensive care unit where an attempt was made to control unstable angina under conventional medical therapy using at least iv nitroderivative, heparin, and calcium blockers. After a standardized preparation PTCA was performed either as an emergency procedure in medically refractory unstable angina (107 cases) or as an elective procedure in controlled situations after a 7 to 10 days symptom-free period. Three hundred fifty-three coronary vessels were attempted. Results of this group are compared with those of a control group made of 670 consecutive stable patients recruited during the same period, and clinical characteristics are envisaged as potential predictive factors. Unstable angina is undoubtedly associated with a higher overall complication rate, but the immediate outcome is strongly affected by the clinical context. As an example, respective success and mortality rates are: 93% and 0% when a full revascularization is attempted; 91% and 0% in elective procedures in patients under 60; 87% and 1.2% in elective PTCA for multiple vessel disease; 80% and 6.5% in emergency PTCA; 80% and 11% in the overall triple vessel disease; 84% and 16% in patients with deeply altered ejection fraction; and 58% and 26% in triple vessel disease with 2 previously occluded coronary arteries. \nHemodynamic effects of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy. BACKGROUND. The somatostatin analogue, ectrootide, is being used to treat postprandial hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Although the therapeutic effect of the drug is presumably secondary to a splanchnic vasoconstrictor action, its effect on splanchnic hemodynamics has never been characterized in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Moreover, it is unknown whether octreotide acts on other vascular beds in this group of patients or whether it affects cardiac output. We, therefore, measured splanchnic, forearm, and systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output before and after administering octreotide (0.4 microgram/kg s.c.) to patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy and diabetic autonomic neuropathy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Splanchnic blood flow was determined from the clearance of indocyanine green in seven patients. We observed that octreotide decreased splanchnic blood flow (from 850 +/- 77 to 664 +/- 48 ml/min, p less than 0.005), increased mean blood pressure (from 97 +/- 6 to 115 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.005), and increased splanchnic vascular resistance (from 0.118 +/- 0.012 to 0.18 +/- 0.018 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.005). Forearm blood flow was measured by plethysmography in 13 patients. Octreotide increased forearm vascular resistance in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (n = 8) from 19.1 +/- 1.0 to 27.2 +/- 3.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml forearm volume (p less than 0.01) and from 25.2 +/- 3.9 to 41.0 +/- 6.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.01) in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (n = 5). Cardiac output was measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Octreotide administration increased cardiac output in five of six patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.5 l/min, p less than 0.02) and five of five patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (from 3.8 +/- 0.4 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 l/min, p less than 0.02). Systemic vascular resistance increased in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy from 21.2 +/- 2 to 24.9 +/- 2.6 (p less than 0.05) but did not change in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. CONCLUSION. The pressor effect of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy is associated with increased splanchnic and forearm vascular resistance and with increased cardiac output. \nMedical aspects of delayed convalescence. Disease and illness are not synonymous. In most instances, disease is demonstrable by anatomic, physiologic, biochemical, microbiologic, or immunologic abnormalities. Disease is a pathologic process. Not all persons with a disease are sick or ill. Symptoms of illness associated with a disease may be manifest or persist after the disease has disappeared. The absence of demonstrable disease, however, does not necessarily mean that symptoms of illness are unreal. Recovery from disease and recovery from illness are not always equated. Many factors, including personal characteristics and social circumstances, can be responsible for recovery from disease and illness. Chronic fatigue syndrome or symptoms of illness can persist in some patients but not in others after many different diseases. \nHow to identify psychogenic disorders of stance and gait. A video study in 37 patients. Thirty-seven patients with psychogenic disorders of stance and gait were clinically evaluated, recorded on video, and analysed with regard to clinical phenomenology. Characteristic, suggestive and unspecific features were identified. Six characteristic features proved most valuable for diagnosis of psychogenesis, as they occurred alone or in combination in 97% of patients: (1) momentary fluctuations of stance and gait, often in response to suggestion; (2) excessive slowness or hesitation of locomotion incompatible with neurological disease; (3) \"psychogenic\" Romberg test with a build-up of sway amplitudes after a silent latency or with improvement by distraction; (4) uneconomic postures with wastage of muscular energy; (5) the \"walking on ice\" gait pattern, which is characterized by small cautious steps with fixed ankle joints; (6) sudden buckling of the knees, usually without falls. Seventy-three percent of patients had additional suggestive features. Classification into characteristic subtypes was not found useful because predominant features varied from patient to patient and occurred in various combinations. Factitious impairment of stance and gait was studied in 13 healthy drama students. Simulated gait dysfunction appeared less conspicuous and more difficult to diagnose than the clinical psychogenic disorders. \nAn analysis of thirty cases of orbital lymphangioma. Pathophysiologic considerations and management recommendations. Thirty cases of orbital lymphangioma were reviewed. Clinical, imaging, and microscopic findings were integrated to develop a pathophysiologic construct and management guidelines. The basic lesion might be considered an abortive vascular system which arborizes among normal structures. Intrinsic hemorrhage expands portions of the small-caliber network into large blood cysts, prompting clinical recognition. While major hemorrhage led to early surgery in 12 cases, long pretreatment intervals could be analyzed in 17 others. Twelve patients had second hemorrhages of varied magnitude, from 2 weeks to 15 years after initial recognition; five patients did not in an average of 6.8 years. Some blood cysts contracted spontaneously. Among 23 operated cases, 12 patients had major new bleeds from 4 days to 12 years after initial surgery; 11 patients did not in an average of 4.2 years. Poor final visual acuity was associated with multiple surgeries. The authors advocate conservatism in surgical case selection and in operative dissection. \nPercutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted angioplasty: initial multicenter experience in 141 patients. Initial multicenter clinical experience with percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted angioplasty is described for 158 lesions in 141 patients. Using a xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer laser generator and 1.5 to 1.75 mm catheters, excimer laser angioplasty was attempted at 135 ns pulse width, 25 to 40 Hz repetition rate, 2 to 5 s laser delivery time and 30 to 60 mJ/mm2 energy fluence. Laser success (greater than 20% improvement in luminal diameter) was achieved in 138 (87%) of 158 lesions, with a reduction to less than 50% stenosis noted in 77 lesions (49%). Overall, laser-assisted balloon angioplasty success (less than 50% residual stenosis without major complication) was observed in 129 (91%) of 141 patients. Procedural complications (abrupt closure 1.3%, side branch occlusion 1.9%, intimal dissection 6.3%, embolization 1.3%, filling defect 1.3%, perforation 1.9% and spasm 1.3% and major complications (non-Q wave myocardial infarction 4.8%, emergency coronary bypass surgery 3.5% and death 0%) were infrequent and predominantly related to subsequent balloon angioplasty. In the early follow-up period (range 1 to 10 months, mean 7), 111 (79%) of the 141 patients remain asymptomatic, whereas symptoms have recurred in 27 (19%) and 3 patients (2.1%) have died. Thus, percutaneous coronary excimer laser angioplasty appears to be a feasible and safe procedure. Assessment of the impact of this technology on the acute complications of and restenosis rates after angioplasty awaits further follow-up analysis. \nLong-term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use and Helicobacter pylori infection. This study investigates whether patients who take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are more likely to have Helicobacter pylori gastritis than age-matched individuals who do not take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and whether patients who take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs who are also infected with H. pylori are more likely to have dyspepsia, mucosal damage, or ulcers than those who are not infected. Two studies were performed, one serological and the other endoscopic, both in arthritis patients receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs chronically. The presence of H. pylori was identified with a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. One hundred eighty-three patients participated in the serological study and 75 patients in the endoscopic study. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased with age, independent of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use; the age-adjusted frequency of H. pylori infection in arthritis patients paralleled that of 351 asymptomatic individuals without arthritis. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased from 30.7% in age group 21-30 years to 73.4% in age group 61-75 years. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced mucosal injury, either hemorrhages or erosions, was more frequent in those without H. pylori infection than with infection (61% vs. 32% for hemorrhages and 57% vs. 34% for erosions for those without and with H. pylori infection; only the difference in the frequency of hemorrhages was significant, P less than 0.05). No difference was observed in the presence of dyspeptic symptoms between those with and without H. pylori infection. These data suggest that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced damage to the gastroduodenal mucosa does not increase the susceptibility to H. pylori infection. \nEffects of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on respiratory resistance in normal and asthmatic subjects. The effects of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on respiratory resistance were studied in 15 healthy subjects and 30 asthmatic subjects. Respiratory resistance (impedance) was measured with the pseudo-random noise forced oscillation technique while the subjects rebreathed from a wet spirometer in a closed respiratory circuit in which end tidal carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) could be controlled. Hypercapnia was induced by partially short circuiting the carbon dioxide absorber, and hypocapnia by voluntary hyperventilation. The circulating air was saturated with water vapour and kept at body temperature and ambient pressure. A rise of end tidal PCO2 of 1 kPa caused a significant fall in respiratory resistance in both normal and asthmatic subjects (15% and 9% respectively). A fall of PCO2 of 1 kPa did not cause any significant change in impedance in the control group. In the asthmatic patients resistance increased by 13%, reactance fell by 45%, and the frequency dependence of resistance rose 240%. These findings confirm that hypocapnia may contribute to airway obstruction in asthmatic patients, even when water and heat loss are prevented. \nGliofibroma. Case report. The case history of an infant with a large gliofibroma is presented. Gliofibromas are rare mixed glialmesenchymal tumors that have been poorly characterized. The computerized tomography appearance and a detailed light and electron microscopic description are presented, along with immunoperoxidase studies of this tumor. This case is compared with gliofibromas described elsewhere in the literature. \nMidgut volvulus in infants: diagnosis with US. Work in progress. The authors present findings from ultrasound (US) studies that can alert sonologists to the possibility of midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus in neonates and infants. A fluid-filled, distended duodenum seen at US examination in infants is a nonspecific sign of duodenal obstruction, as well as one of the signs of midgut malrotation. In addition, dilated, thick-walled bowel loops, mainly to the right of the spine, and peritoneal fluid were found at abdominal US examinations of three infants with midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus. In one infant with uncomplicated midgut malrotation, only signs of duodenal obstruction were present. The findings at US of duodenal obstruction associated with thickened bowel loops to the right of the spine and peritoneal fluid should lead the sonologist to suspect midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus, a potentially fatal condition, and an upper gastrointestinal series should then be performed to confirm the diagnosis. \nOptimal dose of neuroleptic in acute schizophrenia. A controlled study of the neuroleptic threshold and higher haloperidol dose. After individual determination of neuroleptic threshold (NT) doses of haloperidol, 106 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (Research Diagnostic Criteria) were treated openly at such doses (mean, 3.7 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for 2 weeks. Ten responding patients were discharged and unavailable for follow-up or refused subsequent randomization, and one non-responding patient refused randomization. The remaining 95 responding or nonresponding patients were then randomly assigned, double-blind, to a dosage of haloperidol two to 10 times higher (mean, 11.6 +/- 4.7 mg/d) or to a continuing NT dosage (mean, 3.4 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for another 2 weeks. Of the 58 patients exposed only to NT dosages of haloperidol, 72% clinically recovered within the 5-week trial. Higher dosages given to 47 patients did not lead to greater improvement in measures of psychosis, but did produce slightly greater declines in measures of hostility. Higher dosages did regularly lead to significant increases in distressing extrapyramidal side effects. \nPhysiology and pathophysiology of colonic motor activity (2). The basic motor function of the colon is to mix and knead its contents, propel them slowly in the caudad direction, hold them in the distal colon until defecation, and provide a strong propulsive force during defecation. Infrequently, it also produces mass movements in the proximal colon. These motor functions are achieved in most species by three different types of contractions: the individual phasic contractions that include the short- and long-duration contractions, organized groups of contractions that include the migrating and nonmigrating motor complexes, and special propulsive contractions (giant migrating contractions). The spatial and temporal patterns of all of these contractions are controlled by myogenic, neural, and chemical control mechanisms. The individual phasic contractions are highly disorganized in time and space in the colon. For this reason, they are effective in mixing and kneading and slow distal propulsion. The underlying cause of the disorganization of short duration contractions is the irregularity in the frequency and waveshape of colonic electrical control activity and its phase unlocking throughout the colon. The individual contractions in many species occur in cyclic bursts called contractile states. At least in some species, these contractile states exhibit mostly caudad and sometimes orad migration. However, there are also nonmigrating or randomly migrating contractile states in the colon. These two patterns of contractile states are called colonic migrating motor complexes and colonic nonmigrating motor complexes, respectively. The giant migrating contractions provide the strong propulsive force for defecation and mass movements. The neural control of colonic contractions is organized at three levels--enteric, autonomic, and central. The enteric nervous system contains cholinergic and peptidergic neurons and plays a major role in the control of colonic contractions. The autonomic nerves, the vagi, pelvic, lumbar colonic, hypogastric, and splanchnic nerves, seem to continuously monitor the state of the colon and provide a modulatory input when necessary. These nerves play a major role in the reflexive control of colonic motor function. The voluntary input from the central nervous system coordinates the motor activity of the colon, rectum, anal canal and sphincters for orderly evacuation of feces during defecation. The role of acetylcholine, nonadrenaline, and the yet to be completely identified nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitter, possibly VIP, in the control of contractions is fairly well established. Besides these, there are several other peptides and chemicals that are localized in the colonic wall; their physiological roles remain unknown. Colonic motor activity has been studied in several disease states. The findings have not always been consistent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nAssessment of the role of the glucocorticoid system in aging processes and in the action of food restriction. The Glucocorticoid Cascade Hypothesis of Aging and the hypothesis that food restriction retards the aging processes by preventing the development with age of hyperadrenocorticism were investigated. A longitudinal life span study of the daily concentration pattern of plasma corticosterone was conducted in male Fischer 344 rats fed ad libitum or restricted to 60% of the mean food intake of ad libitum fed rats. In another group of ad libitum fed and food-restricted rats, the influence of age on the response of plasma corticosterone levels to restraint stress was measured as was the time course of the return of plasma corticosterone to basal levels following the stress. The findings do not support the hypothesis that food restriction retards the aging processes by preventing the development of hyperadrenocorticism with advancing age. They also indicate that the Glucocorticoid Cascade Hypothesis does not describe a major aspect of the aging processes. Rather, the results suggest the possibility that a lifetime of daily periods of mild hyperadrenocorticism may, if anything, retard the aging processes. \nEffects of calcium-free solution, calcium antagonists, and the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 on mechanical responses of skeletal muscle from patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if alteration in the function of the dihydropyridine receptor may in turn modify halothane-induced contractures in muscle bundles from patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH). The effects of Ca(2+)-free Krebs Ringer (KR) solution, 5 microM verapamil, 5 microM nifedipine, and 10 microM of the Ca2+ agonist BAY K 8644 on halothane-induced contracture were therefore investigated. The halothane-induced contracture was prevented in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and significantly reduced in the presence of verapamil or nifedipine. BAY K 8644 significantly enhanced the 0.5-, 1.0-, and 1.5-vol % halothane-induced contracture in MH-susceptible muscle bundles. When BAY K 8644 was dissolved in Ca(2+)-free KR solution, no contracture was observed in MH-susceptible muscle bundles. These results on cut MH-susceptible human muscle bundles support the hypothesis that halothane-induced contracture in MH can be modified by the binding of Ca2+ agonists or antagonists to the dihydropyridine receptor. The role of Ca2+ entry phenomena remains unclear, but the results suggest that extracellular Ca2+ is required to reprime or to bind to some sites of the dihydropyridine receptors. \nRegulation of MHC class II antigen expression. Opposing effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced HLA-DR and Ia expression depends on the maturation and differentiation stage of the cell. MHC class II induction by cytokines has been suggested to play a major role in the initiation and propagation of immune and autoimmune processes. TNF-alpha has been found both to enhance and also to inhibit IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression. In the present studies, the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma induced MHC class II expression was tested in various cell lines. On the basis of the data, we propose that, depending on the stage of differentiation and maturation of the cells, TNF-alpha might synergize or antagonize the affects of IFN-gamma on the regulation of MHC class II expression. Thus, in immature cells such as HL-60 or THP-1, TNF-alpha enhances IFN-gamma-induced class II expression. However, when differentiation was induced in these cells by TPA or IFN-gamma, the additive effect of TNF-alpha on the IFN-gamma induced DR expression was eliminated. Furthermore, TNF-alpha down-regulates the IFN-gamma-induced class II expression in differentiated cells such as human skin fibroblasts or activated macrophages. In bone marrow cells induced to differentiate in vitro, TNF-alpha decreased the IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression in a maturation-dependent fashion. These results provide a rational explanation for the conflicting reports regarding the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced class II expression. But more importantly they may be relevant to the biologic function of TNF-alpha. Thus, we show that TNF-alpha-treated mice have reduced level of Ia expression on peritoneal macrophages and in vivo treatment with TNF-alpha antagonizes the ability of IFN-gamma to induce class II expression on these macrophages. \nA comparison of enalapril with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure BACKGROUND. To define better the efficacy of vasodilator therapy in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure, we compared the effects of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate with those of enalapril in 804 men receiving digoxin and diuretic therapy for heart failure. The patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive 20 mg of enalapril daily or 300 mg of hydralazine plus 160 mg of isosorbide dinitrate daily. The latter regimen was identical to that used with a similar patient population in the effective-treatment arm of our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial. RESULTS. Mortality after two years was significantly lower in the enalapril arm (18 percent) than in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arm (25 percent) (P = 0.016; reduction in mortality, 28.0 percent), and overall mortality tended to be lower (P = 0.08). The lower mortality in the enalapril arm was attributable to a reduction in the incidence of sudden death, and this beneficial effect was more prominent in patients with less severe symptoms (New York Heart Association class I or II). In contrast, body oxygen consumption at peak exercise was increased only by hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate treatment (P less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction, which increased with both regimens during the 2 years after randomization, increased more (P less than 0.05) during the first 13 weeks in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate group. CONCLUSIONS. The similar two-year mortality in the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate arms in our previous Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (26 percent) and in the present trial (25 percent), as compared with that in the placebo arm in the previous trial, (34 percent) and the further survival benefit with enalapril in the present trial (18 percent) strengthen the conclusion that vasodilator therapy should be included in the standard treatment for heart failure. The different effects of the two regimens (enalapril and hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate) on mortality and physiologic end points suggest that the profile of effects might be enhanced if the regimens were used in combination. \nEndoscopic injection sclerotherapy versus conservative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding esophageal varices. We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the treatment of 37 patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results were compared with those in another 33 HCC patients treated only conservatively, without EIS, during the same period. A majority of both groups died within 3 weeks after treatment. Comparing the two groups, there was no significant difference in fatal bleeding (66% vs 75%), but significantly fewer of the EIS patients died of the index hemorrhage (43% vs. 83%; p less than 0.01). Also, in the absence of portal vein thrombosis, EIS significantly reduced the risk of fatal bleeding (31% vs. 73%; p less than 0.25). The mean days of survival were 32 +/- 15 (range, 2 to 320) in the EIS group and 10 +/- 14 (range, 2 to 270) in the compared group (p less than 0.001). We conclude that EIS provides temporary control of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with unresectable HCC. The major factors contributing to EIS failure are the lethal propensity of the underlying disease and portal vein thrombosis. \nA relationship between proteinuria and acute tubulointerstitial disease in rats with experimental nephrotic syndrome. The relationship between tubulointerstitial nephritis and proteinuria was characterized in experimental nephrosis in rats. In one group, proteinuria induced by aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) was reduced by using an 8% protein diet and adding the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril to the drinking water. Two control groups were injected with saline and PAN, respectively, and fed a 27% protein diet. The first group had significantly reduced albuminuria and a definite attenuation of tubular cell injury. There was a strong positive correlation between the number of interstitial macrophages and albuminuria. The beneficial effect was reproduced by dietary-protein restri",
