        "text": "lational levels. Both type I and type II fibroblasts synthesized normal amounts of C1r and C1s. These data suggest that the lower than expected amounts of functionally active C1 INH in type I HANE may be due, in part, to a decrease in rate of synthesis of the protein, and that the expressions of the normal C1 INH allele in HANE is influenced by the type of abnormal allele present. \nOrbital exenteration with eyelid sparing: indications, technique, and results. Of 22 orbital exenterations performed from January 1980 to December 1989, 16 were performed by an eyelid-sparing technique, and six were allowed to heal by spontaneous granulation. Reviewing these procedures, we conclude that the eyelid-sparing method is indicated mainly for advanced primary orbital malignancies and for certain secondary orbital malignancies such as orbital extension of uveal melanoma, conjunctival melanoma, and conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma. It is not usually applicable to orbital invasion of malignant eyelid tumors such as basal cell carcinoma and sebaceous gland carcinoma. Advantages of the eyelid-sparing method are more rapid healing and earlier fitting of a prosthesis. \nCarotid cavernous fistula after minimal facial trauma. Report of a case. The carotid cavernous fistula has historically been associated with extensive facial trauma as a result of direct or indirect forces. Most fistulas of traumatic origin develop as a result of a fracture through the base of the skull, which produces a force causing laceration of the internal carotid artery in the region where it approximates the cavernous sinus. We report a case in which apparently minimal head trauma resulted in the development of a carotid cavernous fistula. The rather innocuous presentation of this complication requires particular attention by the caregiver in assessing the patient sustaining maxillofacial trauma. \nOutcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction who are ineligible for thrombolytic therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine what proportion of patients with acute myocardial infarction are not eligible for thrombolytic therapy and to assess their natural history. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A large community-based hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized during a 27-month period. MEASUREMENTS: Of 1471 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 230 (16%) received thrombolytic therapy according to the protocol and an additional 97 (7%) received nonprotocol thrombolytic therapy, primary coronary balloon angioplasty, or both because of contraindications. The other 1144 patients (78%) did not receive reperfusion therapy. MAIN RESULTS: The patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy were older, more likely to be women, and more likely to have a history of hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, or chronic angina (all comparisons, P less than 0.002). An average of 1.9 reasons for exclusion were identified per patient among the ineligible patients. Mortality was fivefold higher among ineligible patients (19%; Cl, 16% to 21%) than among protocol-treated patients (4%; Cl, 1% to 6%) (P less than 0.001). In-hospital mortality rates for excluded patients were 28% (Cl, 23% to 32%) in elderly patients (age, greater than 76 years; n = 396); 29% (Cl, 23% to 35%) in patients with stroke or bleeding risk (n = 209); 17% (Cl, 14% to 20%) in patients with delayed presentation (greater than 4 hours after the onset of chest pain; [n = 599]); 14% (Cl, 11% to 16%) in patients with an ineligible electrocardiogram (ECG) (n = 673); and 26% (Cl, 21% to 32%) in patients with a miscellaneous reason for exclusion (n = 243). Independent predictors of increased mortality were: age greater than 76 years, stroke or other bleeding risk, ineligible ECG, or the presence of two or more exclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy is currently used in the United States for only a minority of patients with acute myocardial infarction: those who have low-risk prognostic characteristics. \nPatellofemoral pain caused by overactivity. A prospective study of risk factors in infantry recruits. A prospective study of 390 infantry recruits revealed that the medial tibial intercondylar distance and that the isometric strength of the quadriceps, tested at 85 degrees of flexion of the knee, had a statistically significant correlation with the incidence of patellofemoral pain caused by overactivity. Increased medial tibial intercondylar distance and increased strength of the quadriceps were therefore deemed to be risk factors for this syndrome. \nEffect of intrathoracic pressure on plasma arginine vasopressin levels. Abdominal distention during pneumoperitoneum results in a marked increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels, which has been ascribed to an increase in intrathoracic pressure. Because of this relationship, tense ascites could contribute to nonosmotic release of antidiuretic hormone, to the development of hyponatremia, and eventually to further ascites formation. The effect of pneumoperitoneum, thoracocentesis, and paracentesis on plasma arginine vasopressin levels was studied in three groups of patients, and the mechanism by which these maneuvers may induce these changes was investigated. Patients with pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or ascites showed a significant increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels, and thoracocentesis or paracentesis resulted in a decrease in these levels. Plasma vasopressin levels increased significantly during pneumoperitoneum, as did intrathoracic and atrial pressures; the atrial transmural pressure gradient declined. However, no changes in plasma levels of norepinephrine, aldosterone, and renin activity were observed during pneumoperitoneum. Changes in plasma arginine vasopressin levels correlated with the changes in intrathoracic and atrial pressures and transmural pressure gradient. The authors conclude that increased intrathoracic pressure is associated with an increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels and propose that ascites could be a factor promoting vasopressin release by acting on intrathoracic volume receptors in decompensated cirrhotics. \nToxic effects of cisplatin alone and in combination with gentamicin in stria vascularis of guinea pigs. The toxic effects on the stria vascularis of treatment with cisplatin alone and combined with the aminoglycoside antibiotic, gentamicin, were studied in guinea pigs. The toxicity induced in albino and pigmented guinea pigs was investigated morphologically with light and transmission electron microscopy, and functionally by brainstem-evoked response audiometry. The results of hearing thresholds were variable, ranging from no change in one ear in some of the animals to a hearing loss of 20 dB in one or both ears when treated with low-dose cisplatin alone or in combination with gentamicin. Bilateral deafness resulted from high-dose cisplatin combined with gentamicin. The combined treatment produced prominent structural damage in the stria vascularis. The results should be considered when aminoglycoside therapy is required in conjunction with cisplatin. \nMalignant melanoma arising in a dermoid cyst of the ovary. Autopsy findings of primary malignant melanoma arising in an ovarian dermoid cyst in an 86-year-old woman are presented. The right ovary was replaced by a dermoid cyst, 14 x 9 x 9 cm in size, in which several nodular tumors with diameters less than 3.2 cm were localized. They comprised diffusely proliferating anaplastic cells with prominent nucleoli. Some of them contained melanin pigments in the cytoplasm. The tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein and ultrastructurally showed melanosomes. In addition, several benign pigmented lesions resembling dermal nevus, pigmented schwannoma, or cellular blue nevus were present in the dermoid cyst, one of which contained a malignant melanomatous component. Histologic transition between benign and malignant components and the presence of another small focus of atypical melanocytes in the benign lesion suggested that the malignant melanoma arose in close association with the previously existing benign pigmented lesions in the dermoid cyst. \nElective coronary artery bypass surgery without homologous blood transfusion. Early results with an inexpensive blood conservation program. Restriction of donor blood transfusions in cardiac surgery should reduce risks of infective contamination and antigenicity. We report a systemic, simple and inexpensive blood conservation program used for 121 consecutive patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass surgery without need for homologous blood transfusion. The left internal mammary artery was grafted in all cases, in addition to saphenous vein grafts. Autologous, heparinized blood was removed intraoperatively, pre-bypass, and returned to the patient at conclusion of the extracorporeal circulation. The volume remaining in the oxygenator and the tubing set was returned without cell processing or hemofiltration. Using the hard-shell cardiotomy reservoir from the heart-lung machine, autotransfusion of the shed mediastinal blood was continued hourly up to 18 hours after surgery. The mean postoperative mediastinal bleeding was 551 +/- 206 ml, of which 505 +/- 218 ml was autotransfused. No re-exploration for bleeding was required and no homologous red-cell transfusions were given. Five patients each received 1-2 units of fresh frozen plasma because of prolonged bleeding time. Morbidity was low and mortality nil. At discharge the mean hemoglobin was 12.0 +/- 1.4 g/dl and the hematocrit 36.0 +/- 4.2%. \nInsect paralysis by baculovirus-mediated expression of a mite neurotoxin gene. Female mites of the species Pyemotes tritici inject an extremely potent venom into their insect prey that causes muscle-contraction and paralysis. These mites are able to paralyse insects 150,000 times their size and their venom is effective in a broad range of insect species. A toxin (TxP-I) associated with the mite venom apparatus causes immediate muscle-contractive paralysis when injected into insects but not mice. In this report, we describe the cloning, sequencing and expression of a complementary DNA (Tox-34) encoding TxP-I. Insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus (vEV-Tox34) expressing Tox-34 secrete three polypeptides related to TxP-I which cause paralysis on injection. Larvae infected with vEV-Tox34 become paralysed during infection, thus reflecting the potential application of this toxin gene in insect biocontrol methods. The toxin gene expression system will also allow further exploration of the neurophysiological basis of its insect-specific effects. \nVogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. Clinical course, therapy, and long-term visual outcome. We reviewed data from 26 patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome who presented at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between March 1969 and February 1990. Visual outcomes were good, with final visual acuity of better than 20/30 in 29 (66%) of 44 eyes and of worse than 20/400 in only three (7%) of 44 eyes. A poor prognosis was associated with the development of choroidal neovascular membranes or chronic uveitis. All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroid therapy averaged 6 months, but was prolonged (48 months) in patients who developed chronic uveitis. Disease recurred in nine (43%) of 21 patients in the first 3 months, usually in association with a rapid tapering of steroid dosage. We recommend the early, aggressive use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and a gradual tapering of drug dosage for 6 months after presentation. \nSplenosis presenting as a left renal mass indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. Splenosis following splenic trauma is a common but underdiagnosed entity before surgical exploration. In all previously reported cases the ectopic splenic tissue was distinctly separate from the kidney. To our knowledge we report the first known case in which the splenic tissue was located in direct apposition with the kidney. Using conventional imaging techniques, including renal ultrasonography, abdominal computerized tomography and selective renal arteriography, this ectopic splenic tissue appeared to be part of the left kidney and was indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. The pathophysiology, clinical presentation and diagnostic studies of splenosis are reviewed. \nMetabolic consequences of (regional) total pancreatectomy. Little information has been reported on the metabolic characteristics of the totally pancreatectomized patient or the efficacy of medical management after radical pancreatic surgery. The prospective evaluation of 49 such patients, with 31% followed for 48 or more months, forms the basis of this report. The major immediate postoperative challenge is control of diarrhea and weight stabilization. Chronically patients have an increased daily caloric requirement (mean +/- SE, 56 +/- 1 kcal/kg), not wholly explained by moderate steatorrhea (fecal fat excretion, 16% +/- 2% of unrestricted fat intake). Despite persistent malabsorption, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamin, magnesium, and trace element serum levels can be prevented in most patients. Pancreatogenic diabetes is characterized by (1) absence of the major glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon, (2) instability, and (3) frequent hypoglycemia, with the latter parameters improving with rigorous home glucose monitoring. No patient has developed clinically overt diabetic micro- or macrovascular disease. Performance status in long-term survivors has been reasonable. However adverse chronic sequelae of the operation occur and include an unusual frequency of liver disease, characterized by accelerated fatty infiltration, and osteopenia, with an 18% reduction in radial bone mineral content noted in pancreatectomized patients studied more than 5 years after surgery. \nCorrelation of nuclear morphometry and DNA ploidy in rectal cancer. Several investigators have used morphometric measurements to determine differences in the nuclear size and shape of normal and neoplastic colorectal tissue. Changes in nuclear morphometric parameters have also been shown to correlate with prognosis in a variety of noncolorectal cancers. The association of nuclear morphometry with prognostic indicators in rectal cancer has not been well studied. Measurements of the nuclear area, perimeter, longest cord, and circularity factor from 39 primary rectal adenocarcinomas were compared with DNA content, degree of tumor differentiation, Dukes' class, and patient survival. Nuclear circularity was found to correlate with DNA ploidy. Nondiploid tumors with a DNA index greater than 1.3 had significantly more circular nuclei than tumors with diploid or near-diploid DNA content. There was no correlation between nuclear morphometry and Dukes' class or patient survival. Significant increases in DNA content of rectal cancers appear to be reflected by measurable changes in nuclear shape. Nuclear morphometric measurements may provide useful information in the study of the progression of neoplastic changes in colorectal cancer. \nChondrosarcoma of the parapharyngeal space. Chondrosarcoma is rarely found arising in the head and neck region. An unusual case arising in the parapharyngeal space in a male is reported and the differential diagnosis, pathology and treatment are discussed. \nCoronary angioplasty in single-vessel complex lesions: short- and long-term outcome and factors predicting acute coronary occlusion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of complex coronary lesions (plaque ulceration and/or thrombus) has an increased risk of procedural complications. To assess the influence of these angiographic features on immediate and long-term results of PTCA, we prospectively compared the success rate, incidence of procedural complications, and restenosis rate in two groups of patients selected on the basis of the presence (study group = 30 patients) or absence (control group = 200 patients) of complex morphology at the time of angioplasty. The two groups were similar with regard to extent of coronary artery disease and site of coronary stenosis. Patients in the study group had a higher incidence of periprocedural acute coronary occlusion (47% vs 6%; p less than 0.01), which in 78% of the cases was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty and intracoronary thrombolysis. Univariate correlates of this complication were Canadian Cardiovascular Society class IV (57% vs 19%; p less than 0.05) and recent (less than 30 days) onset of worsening of symptoms (71% vs 31%; p less than 0.05). The incidence of acute myocardial infarction was slightly higher in the study group (6.7% vs 2%; p = NS), and the success rate with redilatation was the same (90%). Clinical and angiographic follow-up data were obtained from all patients in whom the procedure was successful; the restenosis rate was 55% in the study group compared with 36% in the control group (p less than 0.05). \nIntravascular ultrasound imaging of human coronary arteries after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: morphologic and quantitative assessment. An intravascular ultrasound catheter system was used in patients to assess the effect of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In 14 out of 16 patients, the intravascular ultrasound catheter could be successfully advanced to the site of a previous dilatation. Qualitative assessment of the cross-sectional images revealed intimal thickening and an increase of ultrasound reflectance and calcification at atherosclerotic coronary arteries. A disruption of the obstructing plaque and evidence for local dissections (11 of 14 cases) were observed after angioplasty. The quantitative comparison between angiography and the ultrasound measurement showed a close correlation for vessel sites distant to the dilatation (r = 0.91 for vessel diameter; r = 0.86 for luminal area; p less than 0.001). After angioplasty, the quantitative evaluation of the dilated area was possible in 11 cases. The correlation of angiographic and sonographic measurements of these segments was good for the assessment of the vessel diameter (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001), but poor for the determination of the luminal area (r = 0.48, p = 0.10). This difference reflected the complex morphology of the vessel lumen after angioplasty, which would be better assessed by the cross-sectional sonographic technique than by contrast angiography. The intravascular imaging of coronary arteries provides a new and unique method to obtain information on the plaque morphology and composition, and to assess the local effects of interventional procedures and their complications. \nSmoking and mortality among older men and women in three communities. BACKGROUND. Although cigarette smoking is the leading avoidable cause of premature death in middle age, some have claimed that no association is present among older persons. METHODS. We prospectively examined the relation of cigarette-smoking habits with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular causes, and cancer among 7178 persons 65 years of age or older without a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cancer who lived in one of three communities: East Boston, Massachusetts; Iowa and Washington counties, Iowa; and New Haven, Connecticut. At the time of the initial interview, prevalence rates of smoking in the three communities ranged from 5.2 to 17.8 percent among women and from 14.2 to 25.8 percent among men. During five years of follow-up there were 1442 deaths, 729 due to cardiovascular disease and 316 due to cancer. RESULTS. In both sexes, rates of total mortality among current smokers were twice what they were among participants who had never smoked. Relative risks, as adjusted for age and community, were 2.1 among the men (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 2.7) and 1.8 among the women (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.4). Current smokers had higher rates of cardiovascular mortality than those who had never smoked (as adjusted for age and community, the relative risk was 2.0 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.9] among the men and 1.6 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.3] among the women), as well as increased rates of cancer mortality (relative risk, 2.4 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.1] among the men and 2.4 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.9] among the women). In both sexes, former smokers had rates of cardiovascular mortality similar to those of the participants who had never smoked, regardless of age at cessation, whereas the rates for all cancers, as well as smoking-related cancers, remained elevated among men who had once smoked. CONCLUSIONS. Our prospective findings indicate that the mortality hazards of smoking extend well into later life, and suggest that cessation will continue to improve life expectancy in older people. \nTissue polypeptide antigen activity in cerebrospinal fluid: a marker of central nervous system metastases of breast cancer. Tissue polypeptide antigen (TPpA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured in 59 consecutive breast cancer patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subsequently, we determined that 13 patients had parenchymal brain metastases, 10 had leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and 36 had no CNS involvement. The concentration of TPpA, which is a nonspecific marker for cell proliferation, was significantly higher in patients with CNS metastases than in those without it (P less than .0001; Mann-Whitney test). A tentative cutoff value for CNS metastases was set at 95 U/L TPpA; the upper limit of values indicating absence of CNS metastases was 89 U/L. Given these cutoff points, the sensitivity of TPpA as a marker for CNS metastases was 74% and the specificity was 100%; the predictive values of positive and negative tests were 100% and 86%, respectively. In 16 patients with CNS metastases, no correlation was found between TPpA activity in corresponding CSF and blood samples (correlation coefficient, Spearman's rho = .4; P greater than .1). In three patients treated for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the measurements of CSF TPpA showed correlation between the presence of tumor cells in the CSF and neurological clinical function. TPpA concentrations decreased in parallel with the clinical response and increased prior to CNS disease progression. As a marker for CNS metastases, the level of TPpA in the CSF in breast cancer patients appears to be superior to the level of protein, lactate dehydrogenase, or glucose, which showed very low sensitivity (41%, 47%, and 8%, respectively). For quantitative evaluation of treatment for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the TPpA level appears to be valuable and superior to CSF cytology, because tumor cells are not always present in CSF samples from patients with this condition. \nHuman papillomavirus type-related DNA and c-myc oncogene alterations in colon cancer cell lines. Although squamous-cell epithelium is the most frequent target site of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, a similar infection is demonstrated in columnar epithelial cells in this paper. The papillomavirus expression in three cell lines was detected in colorectal adenocarcinoma of Chinese patients. The HPV-16 and HPV-18 DNA sequences were found in colorectal cancer cell lines, which might suggest the correlation of HPV to the etiology of colorectal cancers. In addition, c-myc oncogene was identified by amplification in all three colorectal cancer cell lines, but only normal germ-line fragments were found in control tissue. The correlation between HPV and c-myc, and the implications of these findings in colorectal cancers are also discussed. \nParathyroiditis associated with hyperparathyroidism and branchial cysts. A 57-year-old man had renal stones, and biochemical investigation led to a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. Surgical exploration revealed bilateral inferior parathyroid enlargement. Both glands were removed; macroscopically, small cysts were seen on cut sections. Histologic examination showed broad bands of fibrosis, lymphoid follicles, and plasma cells that diffusely effaced the parathyroid architecture. Such features--if seen in the thyroid gland--would be reminiscent of an autoimmune process. The cysts were lined by respiratory and squamous epithelia and contained lymphoid follicles in their walls. Less affected areas of the parathyroid tissue were hyperplastic. It is believed that the inflammatory response in the parathyroid glands that is described in this article may be characteristic. It may result from the cysts or their contents or from an autoimmune reaction. \nIntraoperative ultrasonography: an important surgical adjunct for intramedullary tumors. The echographic characteristics of 186 suspected intramedullary spinal cord tumors were reviewed. Ultrasonography was found to be specific in distinguishing the tumor type, the extent of the lesion, and the presence and type of associated cysts. Ultrasonography greatly facilitates the selection of respective sites for the placement of a myelotomy, and for initiation of the resection. Additionally, this indispensable adjunct provides ongoing images that allow the preoperative plan to be precisely followed in a surgical field where anatomical landmarks are limited and the margin for error is minimal. \nMolecular basis of the enhanced susceptibility of the erythrocytes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria to hemolysis in acidified serum. When incubated in acidified serum, the erythrocytes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are hemolyzed through activation of the alternative pathway of complement (APC), but normal erythrocytes are resistant to this process. PNH cells are deficient in decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a complement regulatory protein that inhibits the activity of both the classical and the alternative pathways. However, deficiency of DAF alone does not account entirely for the aberrant effects of acidified serum on PNH cells. Recently, we have shown that PNH erythrocytes are also deficient in another complement control protein called membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL) that restricts complement-mediated lysis by blocking formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). To determine the effects of the DAF and MIRL on susceptibility to acidified serum lysis, PNH cells were repleted with the purified proteins. DAF partially inhibited acidified serum lysis by blocking the activity of the amplification C3 convertase. MIRL inhibited acidified serum lysis both by blocking the activity of the MAC and by inhibiting the activity the C3 convertase. When DAF function was blocked with antibody, normal erythrocytes became partially susceptible to acidified serum lysis. By blocking MIRL, cells were made completely susceptible to lysis, and control of C3 convertase activity was partially lost. When both DAF and MIRL were blocked, the capacity of normal erythrocytes to control the activity of the APC and the MAC was destroyed, and the cells hemolyzed even in unacidified serum. These studies demonstrate that DAF and MIRL act in concert to control susceptibility to acidified serum lysis; of the two proteins, MIRL is the more important. In addition to its regulatory effects on the MAC, MIRL also influences the activity of the C3 convertase of the APC. Further, in the absence of DAF and MIRL, the plasma regulators (factor H and factor I) lack the capacity to control membrane-associated activation of the APC. \nPrevention of heterotopic ossification in high-risk patients by radiation therapy. Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a frequent occurrence after cemented and cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA). Patients at risk for this complication include those with preexisting ipsilateral or contralateral HO, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, hypertrophic osteoarthrosis, posttraumatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Low-dose radiation therapy effectively prevents HO in this high-risk group when treatment is begun early in the postoperative period. A prospective evaluation has established the efficacy of fractionated and single-dose radiation therapy protocols. Limited radiation portals are used in patients receiving cementless prostheses. A rectangular radiation portal obliquely oriented to the prosthesis enables radiation treatment of the periarticular soft tissues while avoiding exposure of the bone-prosthesis interface. Radiation therapy to this interface may inhibit or delay bony ingrowth. Radiation therapy is the only treatment used to prevent HO that is delivered locally and not systemically. Low-dose radiation therapy using a limited radiation portal is the treatment of choice to prevent HO in high-risk patients after cementless THA. \nLong-term inhibition of tumor growth by tumor necrosis factor in the absence of cachexia or T-cell immunity. The relationship between detrimental (cachectic) and beneficial (antitumor) effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was studied in mice bearing murine tumors transfected to secrete human TNF. In vitro, the TNF-producing transfectants were resistant to the secreted TNF and grew at rates similar to those of untransfected cells or transfected cells that did not secrete TNF. However, tumors formed by the TNF-secreting cells in vivo remained much smaller than the nonsecreting (transfected and untransfected) tumors. This inhibition of tumor growth required only relatively low serum levels of TNF, persisted for many weeks, and was independent of T cells since it occurred in nude mice. Growth of the TNF-secreting tumors increased dramatically after treatment with anti-human TNF antibody, indicating that extracellular TNF secreted by the tumor cells was necessary for the tumor inhibition. Severe weight loss characteristic of cachexia only occurred in animals with very high serum TNF levels (250 pg/ml) and could be prevented or reversed by anti-TNF antibody treatment. These data are consistent with the existence of a therapeutic window in which persistent exposure to human TNF can lead to prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in the absence of T-cell immunity or severe weight loss and without development of resistant tumor variants. \nDemonstration of osteonectin mRNA in megakaryocytes: the use of the polymerase chain reaction. Platelets have been shown to release osteonectin on thrombin stimulation. The origin of platelet osteonectin was unclear as it may have been synthesized by megakaryocytes or it may have been endocytosed from plasma as other platelet alpha-granule constituents are. Platelet osteonectin has a larger apparent molecular size than the bone species, although the molecular basis for this difference has not been elucidated. These two issues have been addressed here by (1) examining the potential for osteonectin biosynthesis in human megakaryocytes by demonstrating the presence of osteonectin mRNA in purified megakaryocytes, and (2) comparing the coding portion of osteonectin transcript in megakaryocytes to the size of its bone counterpart. Because of the limitations of cell population purity and in obtaining sufficient numbers of megakaryocyte cells for Northern analysis, we have used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of human osteonectin mRNA in megakaryocyte and megakaryocyte-depleted bone marrow cells. Isolation of RNA, cDNA synthesis, and PCR were performed on human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells, enriched megakaryocytes, and megakaryocyte-depleted cells. Restriction enzyme analysis of PCR DNA products confirmed the identity of the products as those encoding osteonectin for all three cell populations studied. In addition, the sizes of DNA indicate that osteonectin genomic DNA, nuclear RNA, or altered transcript were not amplified, and that the transcript from megakaryocytes is the same size as that from bone cells. These data suggest that the difference in protein size between platelet and bone osteonectin is due to posttranslational modification. To overcome the possibility that megakaryocyte signal originated from contaminating cells (less than 5% by cell count), all three cell populations were diluted to less than one cell per tube and PCR amplification was performed. Limiting dilution analyses demonstrated the presence of osteonectin mRNA in single megakaryocytes as well as in single cells from the cell population depleted of megakaryocytes, suggesting the capacity for osteonectin biosynthesis in all cells studied. The procedure we describe in this report can be used to examine specific characteristics of mRNA molecules in heterogeneous cell populations and in situations where only small quantities of cells can be obtained. \nThe double-balloon and Inoue techniques in percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty: comparative results in a series of 232 cases. Immediate hemodynamic results of percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty were compared in two consecutive series of unselected patients from the same institution undergoing valvuloplasty with the double-balloon (161 patients) or the Inoue balloon (71 patients) technique. Before valvuloplasty, the patient series were comparable with regard to average age, gender repartition and most clinical, electrocardiographic, X-ray and hemodynamic variables. Poor anatomic forms of mitral stenosis were equally distributed in both series (41% vs. 45%, p = NS). The magnitude of mitral valve area increase and of mean mitral gradient decrease during percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty did not differ significantly in the Inoue balloon and double-balloon series (mean +/- SEM 1.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.95 +/- 0.5 and 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.97 +/- 0.5 cm2, respectively, for mitral valve area and 12 +/- 3 to 5 +/- 2 and 13 +/- 4 to 5 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, for mean mitral gradient). Four cases of 3+ mitral regurgitation occurred in the Inoue balloon series and 7 in the double-balloon series (p = NS). A good immediate result--defined as mitral valve area greater than or equal to 1.5 cm2 with greater than or equal to 25% in mitral valve area gain and mitral regurgitation less than 2+ at the end of the procedure--was observed in 78% of patients in both series. Three cases of tamponade due to chamber perforation and 14 cases of transient air embolism in the right coronary system due to balloon rupture were observed in the double-balloon series. \nMutational analysis of an archaebacterial promoter: essential role of a TATA box for transcription efficiency and start-site selection in vitro. By using a recently developed in vitro transcription assay, the 16S/23S rRNA-encoding DNA promoter from the archaebacterium Sulfolobus sp. B12 was dissected by deletion and linker substitution mutagenesis. The analysis of 5' and 3' deletion mutants defined a core promoter region between positions -38 and -2 containing all information for efficient and specific transcription. Further characterization of this region by linker substitution mutagenesis indicated two sequence elements important for promoter function--one located between positions -38 and -25 (distal promoter element) and the other one located between positions -11 and -2 (proximal promoter element). The distal promoter element encompassed the TATA-like \"box A\" element located approximately 26 nucleotides upstream of the majority of transcription start sites in archaebacteria (Archaeobacteria). All mutations within this box A motif virtually abolished promoter function. Complete inactivation of the proximal promoter element was dependent on extensive mutagenesis; this element is not conserved between archaebacterial promoters except for a high A + T content in stable RNA gene promoters from Sulfolobus. Mutants containing insertions or deletions between the distal and proximal promoter elements were only slightly affected in their transcription efficiency but displayed a shift in their major initiation site, retaining an essentially fixed distance between the distal promoter element and the transcription start site. Thus, efficient transcription and start-site selection were dependent on a conserved TATA-like sequence centered approximately 26 nucleotides upstream of the initiation site, a situation unlike that of eubacterial promoters but resembling the core structure of most eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (and some RNA polymerase III) promoters. This finding suggests a common evolutionary origin of these promoters consistent with the known similarities between archaebacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases. \nDecreased CD45RA T cells in B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia patients: correlation with disease stage. T-cell subsets CD4, CD8 and suppressor-inducers (CD45RA) were determined in 20 patients with B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (B-CLL). The proportion of CD4 and CD45RA was decreased when compared with T cells from normal subjects. CD8 was markedly increased. The activity of concanavalin A-induced suppressor cells was not significantly different from that of normal controls and was negatively correlated to the percentage of CD4 of B-CLL patients. The selective loss of CD45RA cells was more prominent in patients in advanced Rai stages of the disease (III to IV) than in early stages (0 to II). Six patients of the advanced stages group suffered from autoimmune hemolytic anemia, whereas no patient in the early stages of disease showed an autoimmune phenomenon. Our results may indicate a mechanism of autoimmunity in B-CLL similar to that of patients with autoimmune diseases. \nRole of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography after orthotopic liver transplantation. Twelve of 178 (7%) liver transplant patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after transplantation. The indications for ERCP were persistent or late onset cholestasis, recurrent cholangitis, and suspected biliary leaks or strictures. The time between transplantation and ERCP ranged from 44 to 330 days (median 153 days). Biliary complications diagnosed by ERCP included biliary sludge in the form of casts, calculi, or debris (n = 7); bile leaks (n = 2); a biliary stricture (n = 1), and complete biliary obstruction (n = 1). One patient had a normal cholangiogram after transplantation. Biliary sludge was detected by ultrasound before ERCP in only one of six patients. Eight patients underwent endoscopic papillotomy, followed by clearance of biliary sludge in four and dilatation of a biliary stricture in one. Two patients bled after papillotomy but neither required surgical intervention. At a median follow up of 1.2 years (range 0.5-2.8 years), nine patients are well and three have died. ERCP provides both accurate diagnosis of biliary complications after liver transplantation and treatment that obviates the need for additional surgery in selected patients. \nThe JH/LVOH method in the quantification of aortic regurgitation: how the cardiac sonographer may avoid an important potential pitfall. Color flow Doppler allows for methods in which to quantitate the severity of valvular regurgitation. In particular, the regurgitant jet height/left ventricular outflow tract height (JH/LVOH) method of quantitating the severity of aortic regurgitation has been validated and is routinely used in the adult echocardiography laboratory. A potential pitfall exists in the measurement of the LVOH. This article points out this potential source of error and, in addition, proposes steps that may be taken by the cardiac sonographer to avoid this potential measurement pitfall. \nThe double-stapled ileal reservoir and ileoanal anastomosis. A prospective review of sphincter function and clinical outcome. Fifteen consecutive patients (nine males and six females) who underwent construction of a double-stapled ileoanal reservoir (DS-IAR) were prospectively evaluated. Mean and maximal resting pressures preoperatively, before ileostomy closure, and at 12 months, were 53 and 84 mm Hg, 39 and 62 mm Hg, and 62 and 81 mm Hg. Mean and maximal squeeze pressures at those same time periods were 96 and 153 mm Hg, 111 and 173 mm Hg, and 95 and 168 mm Hg. There were no significant decreases in either resting or squeeze pressure between preoperative values and those obtained 12 months after surgery. However, the length of the high pressure zone decreased from 3.8 cm preoperatively to 2.3 cm at 12 months. This reflects the sacrifice of the cephalad 1.5 cm of the internal anal sphincter necessary to effect this anastomosis at a mean of 1.4 cm from the dentate line. However, this maneuver did not result in poor continence. Eleven patients whose ileostomies were closed for a mean of 9 months, ranging from 3 to 15 months, were evaluated regarding functional outcome. Only one patient had any incontinence and this patient had incomplete circular-stapled tissue rings, which necessitated transanal suture repair of the anastomotic defect. Similarly, three of the four patients who sometimes or rarely use a pad at night had transanal-suture reinforcement. Ten of the 11 patients never wear a pad during the day. No pelvic or perianal sepsis occurred. Stratified squamous epithelium was found in 6 of the 13 distal stapler \"donuts\" that were examined. In addition, 10 patients underwent biopsy of the tissue immediately caudad to the circular staple line at the time of ileostomy closure; in five, only stratified squamous epithelium was noted. The DS-IAR is associated with excellent objective physiologic and subjective functional results. \nAdverse effect of therapeutic vasoconstrictors in experimental acute pancreatitis. Alpha-adrenergic drugs commonly are used to treat hypotension resulting from severe acute pancreatitis. It was shown previously that although systemic arterial pressure is increased by phenylephrine, pancreatic microcirculatory perfusion is decreased. Because inadequate tissue perfusion may be critical in the progression of edematous pancreatitis to parenchymal necrosis, it was hypothesized that vasoconstrictors might be harmful in pancreatitis. Therefore the effect of phenylephrine on cerulein-induced mild pancreatitis were studied. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 54) were randomly allocated to 6 experimental groups and subjected to the following infusion regimens: (1) cerulein (cae) + phenylephrine (phe), (2) cae + saline (NS), (3) NS + phe, (4) cae + phenoxybenzamine (pbz) + phe, (5) NS + pbz + phe, and (6) NS. Initial and terminal hematocrit, serum amylase activity, and blood ionized calcium concentration were determined. The animals were killed 9 hours after starting the infusion. Macroscopic and histologic changes were scored by a 'blinded' pathologist. Phenylephrine increased the severity of cerulein-induced pancreatitis as manifested by statistically significant adverse changes in serum amylase, hematocrit, ionized calcium, peripancreatitic soap formation, and acinar cell vacuolization. These changes were antagonized by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that phenylephrine is deleterious in acute experimental pancreatitis, the first demonstration of such an effect by a pharmacologic vasoconstrictor, and suggested that microcirculatory changes may be important in the transition of mild to severe pancreatitis. Caution in the use of vasoconstrictor drugs in patients with acute pancreatitis is recommended. \nClinical effect of continuous gastric cooling for massive GI bleeding in uremia. Continuous gastric cooling (CGC) with dialysate was done in nine hemodiaysis patients with massive gastro-intestinal (GI) bleeding. Eight patients were treated by direct irrigation using a double-lumen naso-gastric (NG) tube without balloon. Four patients with bleeding from the duodenum (B-f-D) had complete hemostasis, and there was only one recurrence. However, two out of four patients with bleeding from the stomach (B-f-S) had complete hemostasis, but all four suffered recurrence. The NG tube had to be reinserted in three patients with B-f-S because of obstruction by clots. The direct irrigation method of CGC thus appears to be more effective for the treatment of B-f-D than B-f-S, so we investigated a three lumen, single-balloon catheter (3L-SBC) with which the bleeding site in the stomach can be cooled and pressed without removing coagula. CGC using the 3L-SBC was done in one patient with B-f-S, and complete hemostasis was obtained without recurrence. \nPreliminary results of left heart bypass in pigs using a heparin-coated centrifugal pump. To assess the feasibility of left ventricular assist without systemic heparinization, we used a commercially available (Sarns 3M) centrifugal pump with tubing set and cannulas, all internally precoated for the purpose of this study with heparin, to bypass the left ventricle in 12 pigs for periods of either 1 or 3 hours. There was no significant activation of clotting and there was no sign of generalized embolization. However, on postmortem studies, 5 kidneys out of 22 examined showed signs of minimal thromboembolism. This experiment shows that artificial left ventricular assist, free of systemic heparinization but using heparin precoating, is feasible and safe, at least for a short period of time. \nDetection of clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis using light reflection rheography. Venography is the current standard for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Noninvasive tests have differing sensitivity and specificity, are technically demanding, and may be subject to variability in interpretation. Light reflection rheography (LRR) is a noninvasive method utilizing light-emitting diodes and a sensor to measure light reflected from the skin surface. The intensity of reflected light establishes a graphic pattern that indirectly quantifies parameters of venous function by measuring changes in the microcirculation. Seventy-two patients who underwent contrast venography at our institution were also evaluated with LRR. Twenty-four patients were found to have DVT as demonstrated by venography. Of these, 23 also had DVT detected by LRR. No evidence of thrombus was seen in 45 patients studied by venography; in this group, 35 had normal venous emptying indicated by LRR. Using LRR, a sensitivity of 96% was achieved in the evaluation of clinically suspected DVT. This sensitivity is comparable with other noninvasive tests. In addition, LRR is easy to operate, portable, inexpensive, and not technically demanding. Further investigation is needed to confirm these data and further define the role of LRR in the evaluation of clinically suspected DVT. \nEffect of ischemia on protein synthesis in the septic liver. The effect of ischemia on hepatic protein synthesis during sepsis is not known, but is of clinical relevance, since hepatic blood flow decreases during the late phase of sepsis. In this study, synthesis of acute-phase proteins was measured in perfused livers of rats 16 hours after sham operation or cecal ligation and puncture. Livers from each group had 45 minutes of complete ischemia or control perfusion. Protein synthesis was measured during two hour perfusion after the ischemia or control period, by determining incorporation of 3H-leucine into total secreted trichloracetic acid precipitated proteins, immunoprecipitated complement component C3 and albumin and phosphotungstenate-precipitated alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Lactate, glutamine-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels in the perfusate were measured during preischemic and postischemic perfusion. Tissue glutathione levels were measured at the end of the perfusion. Synthesis of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was increased by 100 per cent and albumin synthesis decreased by 46 per cent in septic livers, consistent with an acute-phase response and apparent downregulation of albumin synthesis during early sepsis. Synthesis rates were reduced by 50 to 60 per cent after ischemia in perfused livers from sham operated rats and 70 to 80 per cent in livers from septic rats. Hepatic production of interleukin-1 was not different between the groups during perfusion. GOT and GPT levels increased significantly during ischemia of both nonseptic and septic livers and rapidly returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Lactate levels were higher in perfusate of septic than of nonseptic livers before ischemia and increased further during ischemia. The results suggest that ischemia inhibits production of secreted hepatic proteins similarly in nonseptic and septic livers, but perhaps to a slightly greater extent in septic livers. \nInsulin resistance. A multifaceted syndrome responsible for NIDDM, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Diabetes mellitus is commonly associated with systolic/diastolic hypertension, and a wealth of epidemiological data suggest that this association is independent of age and obesity. Much evidence indicates that the link between diabetes and essential hypertension is hyperinsulinemia. Thus, when hypertensive patients, whether obese or of normal body weight, are compared with age- and weight-matched normotensive control subjects, a heightened plasma insulin response to a glucose challenge is consistently found. A state of cellular resistance to insulin action subtends the observed hyperinsulinism. With the insulin/glucose-clamp technique, in combination with tracer glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry, it has been demonstrated that the insulin resistance of essential hypertension is located in peripheral tissues (muscle), is limited to nonoxidative pathways of glucose disposal (glycogen synthesis), and correlates directly with the severity of hypertension. The reasons for the association of insulin resistance and essential hypertension can be sought in at least four general types of mechanisms: Na+ retention, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, disturbed membrane ion transport, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Physiological maneuvers, such as calorie restriction (in the overweight patient) and regular physical exercise, can improve tissue sensitivity to insulin; evidence indicates that these maneuvers can also lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are also associated with an atherogenic plasma lipid profile. Elevated plasma insulin concentrations enhance very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis, leading to hypertriglyceridemia. Progressive elimination of lipid and apolipoproteins from the VLDL particle leads to an increased formation of intermediate-density and low-density lipoproteins, both of which are atherogenic. Last, insulin, independent of its effects on blood pressure and plasma lipids, is known to be atherogenic. The hormone enhances cholesterol transport into arteriolar smooth muscle cells and increases endogenous lipid synthesis by these cells. Insulin also stimulates the proliferation of arteriolar smooth muscle cells, augments collagen synthesis in the vascular wall, increases the formation of and decreases the regression of lipid plaques, and stimulates the production of various growth factors. In summary, insulin resistance appears to be a syndrome that is associated with a clustering of metabolic disorders, including non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, lipid abnormalities, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. \nTwo-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of intracardiac masses in infants and children. We studied six infants and children with intracardiac masses of different causes. The diagnosis was made noninvasively using two-dimensional echocardiography in all six patients. In five patients, surgical excision of the mass was undertaken with good results. Two-dimensional echocardiography is an excellent noninvasive diagnostic tool that allows the clinician to determine the size and location of intracardiac masses in infants and children. \nToxin production by Bacillus pumilus. Two strains of Bacillus pumilus (M11 and M38) and one strain each of Bacillus cereus (M27), Bacillus subtilis (M67), and Enterobacter agglomerans (M14) were identified from the air of Lancashire cotton mills. These strains were tested for cytopathic effects in Vero cells; B pumilus and B cereus strains were also examined for haemolytic activity, lecithinase production, and proteolytic action on casein. Rounding and clumping of the Vero cells occurred after the addition of supernatants prepared from B pumilus and B cereus strains; finger-like projections developed in the cells treated with B pumilus supernatants. Minimal effects occurred with B subtilis and E agglomerans. After two hours of exposure B pumilus (M11) produced the greatest effect, but treatment with trypan blue showed that most cells exposed to the M11 strain were still alive after 96 hours of exposure; those exposed to the supernatant prepared from the M38 strain of B pumilus were dead. Sheep erythrocytes were lysed more rapidly by B cereus than by B pumilus, B cereus (strongly positive) had a greater effect on lecithin than either of the B pumilus strains (M38 weakly positive, M11 negative). All hydrolised casein but the effect was more rapid with one of the B pumilus (M11) strains. It is concluded that not only do the toxins of B pumilus differ from those of B cereus, but there are also differences between the toxins produced by the two strains of B pumilus (M11 and M38). \nCardioplegia by way of the coronary sinus for valvular and coronary surgery. Retrograde coronary sinus perfusion has recently reemerged as an attractive means of delivering cardioplegic solutions during open heart procedures. In patients undergoing aortic valve or aortic root surgery, there is no evidence that coronary sinus cardioplegia results in a better myocardial protection than that achieved with the use of standard methods of anterograde cardioplegia delivery. However, the retrograde approach provides distinct technical advantages that might favor its use as an alternative to direct coronary ostial cannulation. In select subgroups of patients undergoing coronary bypass procedures, there is a growing body of evidence that the coronary sinus route may be more effective than the anterograde route because of its superior capacity to ensure homogeneous distribution of cooling and cardioplegia in myocardial areas supplied occluded arteries. The well established safety of coronary sinus cardioplegia in the clinical setting further justifies its inclusion among techniques for ensuring adequate myocardial preservation during surgically induced ischemic arrest. \nSingle photon emission computed tomography in patients with acute hydrocephalus or with cerebral ischaemia after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), cerebral blood flow was studied in eight patients with gradual deterioration in the level of consciousness after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Four had cerebral ischaemia and four had acute hydrocephalus. In patients with cerebral ischaemia, single photon emission computed tomography scanning showed multiple regions with decreased uptake of technetium-99M labelled d,l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (99mTcHM-PAO) mainly in watershed areas. In patients with acute hydrocephalus, decreased uptake was seen mainly in the basal parts of the brain: around the third ventricle, around the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, and in the basal part of the frontal lobe. After serial lumbar puncture, there was improvement of the uptake of 99mTc HM-PAO in these basal areas in three (convincingly in two and slightly in the other) of the four patients accompanied by clinical improvement in these three patients. These results suggest that patients with acute hydrocephalus and impaired consciousness after SAH, in contrast to patients with cerebral ischaemia, have decreased cerebral blood flow predominantly in the basal parts of the brain. \nRetroperitoneal fibrosis as host response to papillary renal cell carcinoma. A case of papillary renal cell carcinoma associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis is described. This type of fibrosis has not been previously reported to be associated with renal cell carcinoma. The case is of additional interest in that it implicates an immune phenomenon in the pathogenesis of the fibrosis, involving both putative tumor antigens and antigens associated with tumor growth but unrelated to tumor cells. \nA \"twilight period\" of coronary perfusion: the risk of intraoperative infarction in surgery for main left coronary obstruction. This study investigates the significance of an intraoperative period of low coronary perfusion pressure which may lead to ischemia, infarction, or both, in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery for tight left main obstruction. \"Twilight Period\" (TP) was defined as the time interval from initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass to implementation of cold cardioplegia. Fifty-four patients with main left coronary obstruction (greater than 50%) were divided in three groups: Group I (20), TP less than 5 minutes; Group II (15), TP = 5-15 minutes; and Group III (19), TP greater than 15 minutes. Monitoring parameters included: systemic perfusion pressure during TP, perfusion flows, length of TP, time of ischemia, myocardial temperatures during ischemia, postoperative CK-MB level, EKG-detectable infarction, and postoperative therapeutic support requirements. Results: Intraoperative myocardial infarction by EKG was 0% in Group I, 7% in Group II, and 26.3% in Group III; mortality was 0%, 0%, and 15.7%, respectively. CK-MB values were 18 +/- 3.2 IU, Group I; 18.3 +/- 2.5 IU, Group II; and 49.4 +/- 10.3 IU, Group III. Group I vs. III: P 0.01. Levels of postoperative support: Level A, less than 12 hours; Level B, 12-36 hours; and Level C, greater than 36 hours. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was considered Level C. In Group I, 75% (15/20) fell in Level A; 15% (3/20) in Level B and 10% (2/20) in Level C. In Group II, 60% (9/15) fell in Level A; 26.7% (4/15) in Level B; and 13% (2/15) in Level C. In Group III, 36.8% (7/19) fell in Level A; 15.8% (3/19) in Level B; and 47.4% (9/19) in Level C. \nMechanisms of lymphocytotoxicity induced by extracorporeal photochemotherapy for cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Extracorporeal photochemotherapy is an effective treatment for cutaneous T cell lymphoma but its mode of action is uncertain. The reduction in viability of patients' photoirradiated buffy coat lymphocytes was correlated with a 35% increase in DNA single-strand breaks and marked decreases in cellular ATP and NAD levels (to 58 and 34% of control, respectively) immediately after photoirradiation. Complementary in vitro studies were conducted with normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes using a Therakos ultraviolet A (UVA) light box. UVA light was cytotoxic on its own but was potentiated by 8-methoxysporalen. 3-aminobenzamide, a poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibitor, mitigated the cytotoxic effect of ultraviolet A light in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralen in lymphocytes and reduced the amount of nucleotide depletion they caused. 10 J/cm2 of UVA light in the presence of 300 ng/ml 8-methoxypsoralen increased the poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Exposing lymphocytes to deoxycoformycin and deoxyadenosine was found to induce biochemical and physical effects similar to those of photochemotherapy. In summary, we have shown that the lymphocytotoxic effect of extracorporeal photochemotherapy for cutaneous T cell lymphoma is apparently mediated by DNA damage, subsequent poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation and adenine nucleotide depletion. It is not known how the DNA damage and resultant biochemical effects relate to the possible immunological mechanism of extracorporeal photochemotherapy; however, it is possible that its effects can be mimicked by other DNA-damaging agents. \nTumor growth dependent on Kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor inhibited by pentosan polysulfate. A neoangiogenic response is critical for the unrestricted growth of solid tumors beyond a few millimeters in diameter. Release of adequate growth-stimulating activity from tumor cells is obviously required for the stimulation of blood vessel growth, and blockade of such stimulatory activity should repress tumor growth at the microscopic level. To test this hypothesis and to study appropriate inhibitors, we used a human adrenal cancer cell line (SW-13/K-fgf) engineered to secrete Kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor (K-FGF), which we previously showed to induce growth of highly vascularized subcutaneous tumors in animals by autocrine and paracrine stimuli. In the present study, we tested different polysulfates for their selective inhibition of proliferation induced by K-FGF versus proliferation independent of K-FGF. Suramin and dextran sulfate showed slight selective inhibition of K-FGF-induced proliferation, ie, inhibition three- and five-fold greater, respectively, than the inhibition of proliferation independent of K-FGF. In contrast, heparin was inactive. The heparin analogue pentosan polysulfate (PPS), however, showed selective inhibition that was more than 2000-fold greater. The inhibitory effects of PPS on growth of SW-13/K-fgf cells, as well as endothelial cells, were fully reversible by an excess of added FGF. Daily intraperitoneal injections of PPS were tolerated well by athymic nude mice and prevented growth of subcutaneous SW-13/K-fgf tumor xenografts. PPS will be a useful tool to elucidate the effects of FGFs in vitro and in vivo and appears to be a prototype for the development of tumoricidal therapy based on targeting of growth factors. \nCT of acute pancreatitis: correlation between lack of contrast enhancement and pancreatic necrosis. This study was performed to determine if a correlation exists between pancreatic parenchymal enhancement or lack thereof on contrast-enhanced CT and surgical evidence of pancreatic necrosis. Accurate CT assessment of pancreatic vascular perfusion would be helpful in preoperative planning before pancreatic debridement and necrosectomy. The CT scans and medical records were blindly and retrospectively reviewed in 13 patients with the operative diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. In all cases, CT examinations preceded surgery within 72 hr. Surgical and pathologic findings served as the gold standards for the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. Seven (54%) of 13 patients had a region or regions of parenchymal necrosis within the head, body, and/or tail of the pancreas seen during surgery. All seven of these patients had no pancreatic enhancement on CT in at least one region of the pancreas (CT sensitivity = 100%). In four of the seven, two regions were found to be necrotic at surgery, but only one of the two segments did not enhance on CT scans. In three of the seven patients, lack of contrast enhancement on CT (no enhancement of the pancreatic head and body in two patients and throughout the gland in another) correlated with necrosis in the same regions at surgery. The remaining six (46%) patients, who had peripancreatic or small, focal, and/or superficial areas of pancreatic necrosis at surgery, had normal pancreatic enhancement on CT. Our results show that regions of pancreatic necrosis found surgically correlate with lack of enhancement of pancreatic parenchyma on CT. Peripancreatic necrosis and minor areas of focal or superficial parenchymal necrosis were not detected on CT. \nShunt failure caused by valve collapse. Shunt failure due to collapse of the Mini-Holter valve was observed 13 times in 11 out of 179 children with an implanted Mini-Holter ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) or ventriculo-atrial (VA) shunt during a 10 year period. Intussusception of the proximal or distal end of the valve thus caused a shunt failure rate of 6% of the children in this series. Two children experienced this complication twice. All collapsed valves were part of a VP shunt system. Because of this experience use of the mini valve was abandoned and an adult Holter valve was implanted in children over the age of one month. Breakdown of this particular valve has not occurred in 102 children and two hundred adults with the adult Holter shunt system. \nMyocardial ischemia during daily activities: the importance of increased myocardial oxygen demand. The role of increased myocardial oxygen demand in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia occurring during daily activities was evaluated in 50 patients with coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ST segment depression. Each patient underwent ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring for ST segment shifts during normal daily activities and symptom-limited bicycle exercise testing with continuous ECG monitoring. All 50 patients had ST depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV during exercise. A total of 241 episodes of ST depression were noted in the ambulatory setting in 31 patients; only 6% of these were accompanied by angina pectoris. Significant (0.1 mV) ST depression during ambulatory monitoring was preceded by a mean increase in heart rate of 27 +/- 12 beats/min. Patients with ischemia during daily activities developed ST depression earlier during exercise (7.9 +/- 4.4 vs. 14.2 +/- 6.4 min, p less than 0.001) and tended to have significant ECG changes at a lower exercise heart rate and rate-pressure product than did those without ST depression during ambulatory monitoring. In the 31 patients with ischemia during daily activities, the mean heart rate associated with ST depression in the ambulatory setting was closely correlated with the heart rate precipitating ECG changes during exercise testing (r = 0.74, p less than 0.001). \nRenal artery stenosis: preliminary results of treatment with the Strecker stent. Use of the Strecker flexible balloon-expandable tantalum stent for treatment of renal artery stenosis after failed angioplasty or transaortic thromboendarterectomy was evaluated in 10 patients (nine hypertensive, one normotensive). Left (n = 3) and right (n = 5) renal arteries were involved; renal artery stenosis in two patients had developed after kidney transplantation. Indications for stent placement were inadequate immediate postangioplasty response (n = 7), development of considerable restenosis after angioplasty (n = 1), and obstructing intimal flaps following transaortic endarterectomy (n = 2). Stent placement was technically successful (less than 20% residual stenosis) and patency was preserved in eight patients. Of the seven hypertensive patients with successful implantation, two were cured, three had improvement, and two had no change at latest follow-up evaluation (mean, 10.6 months; range, 6-12 months). The Strecker stent may be helpful in treating restenosis after failed revascularization procedures, although the precise indication, true safety, and long-term efficacy of stent placement in renal arteries will not be known until trials with more subjects and longer follow-up periods are completed. \nTransoral decompression evaluated by cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging: a case of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation. Cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging provides simultaneous images of cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics. A patient with a basilar impression accompanied by a Chiari malformation and von Recklinghausen's disease who underwent transoral decompression is reported. Preoperative cine-mode magnetic resonance imaging visualized an associated obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid pulsatile flow at the level of the foramen magnum. Tonsilar herniation (Chiari I malformation) and hydrocephalus were also present. Postoperatively, the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow was resolved concomitant with the correction of the cervicomedullary angulation. On the basis of observations made by magnetic resonance imaging, the surgical treatment of basilar impression accompanied by Chiari malformation is briefly discussed. \nAtrial natriuretic peptide response to cardioversion of atrial flutter and fibrillation and role of associated heart failure. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations were measured before and 1 hour after cardioversion in 40 patients (27 with atrial flutter and 13 with atrial fibrillation) admitted for elective cardioversion. Fourteen (11 with atrial flutter and 3 with atrial fibrillation) had clinical evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). Conversion to sinus rhythm was successful in 39 patients. The mean ANP concentration in the entire group decreased after cardioversion from 38 +/- 4 to 17 +/- 2 pmol/liter (p less than 0.001). In the subgroup with CHF, the ANP level, which was not significantly higher than that in the group without CHF, decreased from 47 +/- 8 to 19 +/- 3 pmol/liter (p less than 0.01). Neither mode of cardioversion (spontaneous 1, pharmacologic 2 and direct-current countershock 36) nor associated CHF influenced ANP response to cardioversion. One patient with atrial flutter and \"failed cardioversion\" had unchanged ANP level. The decrease after cardioversion in ANP concentration correlated with its control level (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001) but not with the decrease in heart rate. The ANP level in patients with atrial fibrillation was 45 +/- 9 vs 38 +/- 5 pmol/liter in those with atrial flutter (difference not significant). Arrhythmia duration, left atrial size, and ventricular rate or arterial blood pressure did not correlate with ANP concentration in any subgroup. It is concluded that (1) the ANP level is elevated comparably in patients with both atrial flutter and fibrillation regardless of the presence or absence of CHF; and (2) the level decreases, independent of the mode of cardioversion or presence of CHF, promptly after successful cardioversion. \nQuantitation of estrogen and androgen receptors in hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent normal human liver. Sex hormones have been shown to influence the development and course of several liver diseases. The worldwide predominance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in males has led to the suggestion that this disease might be hormone-responsive. Therefore, the hepatic estrogen (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) status of liver specimens from such patients was investigated. Samples were obtained from three female and six males patients undergoing liver resection; in each case, a small sample of both the tumor and adjacent normal tissue was collected. All patients had primary hepatocellular carcinoma without cirrhosis. In most cases, the tumor and the normal specimen had an equivalent content of cytosolic ER; however, three of the tumor samples (one female and two male) displayed considerably elevated cytosolic ER levels as compared to that of the normal tissue. In every sample, the tumor contained less nuclear ER than did the normal liver. When AR was measured, tumors of three patients (one female and two male) demonstrated a twofold elevation in cytosolic AR as compared to adjacent normal tissue. In the two male patients, an approximately twofold greater nuclear AR was found. Two other samples from male patients showed a modest elevation of cytosolic AR in the tumors. The patients whose tumors showed elevations in ER were not the same patients as those in whom the AR was elevated. Thus, these studies indicate that certain, but not all, specimens of HCC demonstrate either elevated ER or AR and suggest that a determination of receptor content might be useful prior to initiation of certain antihormone therapies. \nPremenstrual syndrome. Tailoring treatment to symptoms. Despite the interest in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) taken by the media and the public in recent years, some women still do not recognize the cyclic nature of their symptoms. Thus, PMS continues to elude diagnosis. Dr Nader discusses the major categories of symptoms and when they occur, summarizes theories on the cause of PMS, and comments on how well these theories have been substantiated by testing. Choosing agents for treatment on the basis of symptoms to be controlled is also described. \nCHARGE and Joubert syndromes: are they a single disorder? A patient with the CHARGE association (Coloboma of the eye, Heart defect, Atresia of the choana, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia, and Ear anomalies or deafness) had intermittent hyperpnea and cerebellar hypoplasia; therefore, he had both the CHARGE association and Joubert syndrome. The 2 syndromes have not been previously linked. We discuss their similarities and review the literature. \nCurrent medical management of cirrhotic ascites. The presence of ascites may indicate a number of hepatic and extra-hepatic disorders. This situation requires comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause. The evaluation and management of ascites in patients with known cirrhosis is very important since this manifestation of portal hypertension has a detrimental effect on the prognosis for such patients. \nHepatic colorectal metastases: correlation of MR imaging and pathologic appearance. Results of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations for 76 patients with proved colorectal metastases to the liver were retrospectively reviewed. Signal intensity and morphologic patterns of 157 lesions were scored. The morphologic patterns were correlated with the histologic material obtained at segmental hepatic resections or excisional biopsies in 33 patients. In 154 lesions (98%) colorectal metastases to the liver were found to be hyperintense on MR images acquired with a long repetition time/echo time; in 77 lesions (49%) central low-signal-intensity changes were seen. Virtually all larger lesions demonstrated areas of low signal intensity within the tumor. These areas were found to reflect histologic findings of coagulative necrosis and desmoplasia within the tumor. Peripheral hyperintense halos around central hypointense areas encompassed the growing tumor margin and variable degrees of cell necrosis. Hypointense peripheral rims, which correspond to abnormalities of surrounding hepatic parenchyma, were seen in 40 lesions (25%). This sign should not be assumed to represent the fibrous pseudocapsule of primary hepatic malignancy. No correlation between tumor grade (differentiation) and tumor morphology was observed. \nAlterations of the nailfold capillary morphology associated with Raynaud phenomenon in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Quantitative analysis of nailfold capillary morphology was performed in age and sex matched groups of 29 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presenting Raynaud phenomenon (RP), 29 RP negative patients with SLE with the same duration of the disease, and 29 healthy controls. Percentages of tortuous, meandering and bushy capillaries were significantly increased in both groups of patients without influence of RP. Capillary density was lower, mean diameters of the capillary loops were higher in patients, especially when RP was present (at the venular branch in microns, mean +/- SD: controls: 15.0 +/- 2.0, RP negative patients with SLE: 17.6 +/- 3.6, RP positive patients with SLE: 20.5 +/- 6.3). In a subgroup of 13 patients with frequent Raynaud's attacks (more than 1/week), diameters were still higher (22.1 +/- 7.1, p to controls less than 0.0005; p to RP negative patients less than 0.05). In patients with SLE, the prevalence of RP seems not to be associated with the increased number of abnormal capillaries but with capillary enlargement, correlating with the frequency of attacks. \nA review of 32 cases of tardive dystonia. OBJECTIVE: Tardive dystonia, historically combined with tardive dyskinesia, is now viewed as probably having a different pathophysiology, course, outcome, and treatment response than tardive dyskinesia. In addition, patients with tardive dystonia are reported to be younger, and most are men. This study evaluates characteristics of 32 patients with tardive dystonia and compares results to other reports. METHOD: Twenty-four patients had been referred for research purposes and were videotaped, while eight had been followed clinically. Two of the authors reviewed all available videotapes and clinical reports to assess the course of symptoms over time. For global ratings and ratings of affected body parts, two scales were used: the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for tardive dyskinesia and a similar scale for tardive dystonia. The method of case finding does not provide incidence or prevalence data for tardive dystonia. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of the patients experienced onset of tardive dystonia symptoms within 6 years of antipsychotic drug exposure; women had a shorter exposure time. No patient had complete remission of tardive dystonia symptoms, and 22 were moderately or severely impaired when their movements were most prominent. CONCLUSIONS: While epidemiological studies of tardive dystonia have yet to be performed, these results support the observations of others that most patients with tardive dystonia are men, have a short history of exposure to antipsychotic drugs, and may initially present with blepharospasm. Tardive dystonia rarely remits completely, can cause notable disability, and may partially respond to anticholinergic agents. \nThe use of magnetic resonance imaging in the study of edema. A method of studying edema using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is presented. Three patients with lower extremity edema due to congestive heart failure were imaged with a 0.6 tesla system before and after diuresis. Edge detection algorithms were utilized to precisely outline regions of interest for quantification. Water and nonwater elements were separated within the region of interest to quantify water content. The results show that: (1) Edema can be quantified by use of MRI. (2) Subcutaneous edema is distributed along defined planes (ie, nonuniformly). (3) Increased water content is present not only in the subcutaneous tissue but also in deeper lying muscle. \nHypertension and coronary artery disease. Can the chain be broken? Hypertension is an established risk factor for all the clinical sequelae of coronary artery disease. Despite this, individual therapeutic trials of antihypertensive therapy have not demonstrated the expected reduction in coronary morbidity and mortality. This apparent failure is perhaps not surprising when one considers the multifactorial nature of coronary artery disease and the different ways in which hypertension may affect the coronary circulation. Much debate has also centered on the antihypertensive therapy used in major trials in that it may in some way prevent the reduction in coronary mortality. However, thus far no clear evidence of a harmful effect has emerged. Reducing coronary mortality in hypertensive patients is a major challenge but one that can be effectively surmounted by approaching these different factors in a concerted manner. The ultimate goal must be to prevent the development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, but until such time as that can be achieved, the early detection of hypertension is mandatory. The optimal levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressures must be established. Studies on the more recent antihypertensive agents hold promise for a more specific effect on the atherosclerotic process as well as sustained control of arterial blood pressure. In this regard, it would seem essential to develop more precise ways of quantifying atherosclerosis and thus clarifying the nature of its relation to hypertension. Finally, management of hypertension must include precise assessment of the patient's overall cardiovascular risk status and appropriate and aggressive management of all risk factors for coronary artery disease. \nPlatelet-activating factor produces shock, in vivo complement activation, and tissue injury in mice. We previously showed that TNF and endotoxin (LPS) synergize to activate the complement system and produce shock and bowel injury in normal mice. However, C5-deficient mice were protected from these adverse effects. In this study, we show that in mice, platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist prevents TNF- and LPS-induced complement activation, bowel injury, and death, indicating that PAF mediates the actions of TNF and LPS. We then examined the role of the complement system in PAF-induced shock and tissue injury. We found that 1) PAF (3 micrograms/kg) induces shock, hemoconcentration, bowel necrosis, and death in normal mice, whereas C5-deficient mice are protected from these effects. (Protection was abrogated when the dose of PAF was raised to 5 micrograms/kg.) Furthermore, when C5-deficient mice were reconstituted with normal serum, they also developed shock, bowel injury, and death in response to PAF. Thus, C5 is required for PAF to induce injury. 2) PAF activates the complement system in vivo, but not in vitro. The mechanism of complement activation by PAF is unclear. Inasmuch as PAF stimulates neutrophils to release protease that may activate the complement system, we examined the effect of neutrophil depletion on PAF-induced injury and complement activation. We found that neutrophil depletion fails to prevent PAF-induced complement activation, although PAF-induced lethality is much reduced. We conclude that PAF causes complement activation, and acts in synergy with active complement fragments to produce shock and tissue injury. Neutrophils probably do not play the pivotal role in PAF-induced complement activation. \nLeiomyosarcoma arising in atypical fibromuscular hyperplasia (phyllodes tumor) of the prostate with distant metastasis. An extremely rare neoplasm of the prostate, commonly known as phyllodes type of atypical prostatic hyperplasia, is described in a 57-year-old man. Over a 2-year period, the atypical smooth muscle component has transformed into leiomyosarcoma, and eventually metastasized to the bones and the lungs. Such an evolution has never been documented for this tumor. \nRationale for development of low-molecular-weight heparins and their clinical potential in the prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis. Interest in low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) as potential antithrombotic agents was stimulated by two observations in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. The first was finding that LMWH fractions prepared from unfractionated heparin (UFH) progressively lost their ability to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) while retaining their ability to inhibit Factor Xa. The second was the observation that LMWHs prepared by chemical depolarization of UFH are antithrombotic in experimental animal models but produce less microvascular bleeding in experimental models for an equivalent antithrombotic effect than the UFH from which they are derived. Subsequently, it was shown that LMWHs inhibit platelet function and impair vascular permeability less than standard heparin and that LMWHs have a longer biological half-life than standard heparin. A number of LMWHs have been evaluated in clinical trials in general and orthopedic surgery and in the treatment of venous thrombosis. LMWHs are highly effective in orthopedic surgery, where they appear to be more effective than standard heparin. LMWHs have also been shown to be either as effective or more effective than UFH in preventing postoperative thrombosis following general surgery. In preliminary studies, LMWHs appear to be as effective as standard heparin in the treatment of venous thrombosis, but larger studies are required using clinically relevant outcome measures. \nCortical blindness and residual vision: is the \"second\" visual system in humans capable of more than rudimentary visual perception? We studied 12 patients with static cortical blindness to evaluate residual vision after destruction of area 17 and to assess the visual capacity of the subcortical \"second\" visual system in humans. In each case, the cause was bilateral infarction of the occipital lobes. Five patients had total blindness, and four had residual rudimentary vision (RRV), characterized by homonymous areas of light perception in the peripheral field and ability to detect moving objects. Only three patients had the ability to read; two of these had spared macular vision, and the other had spared left homonymous hemimaculae and spared temporal crescent. Neuroimaging and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) correlated with the extent of the visual dysfunction. Total destruction of area 17 bilaterally was associated with total permanent visual loss. The larger the amount of spared visual cortex, the better the vision. Positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) demonstrated retained metabolic activity in islands of preserved area 17 in patients with some residual vision. VEPs were present in totally blind individuals. We conclude that, in humans, useful visual function is preserved only when a critical amount of area 17 is spared. The subcortical second system may participate in the generation of VEPs, but is incapable of conscious visual perception. \nEstramustine binding protein in human brain-tumor tissue. Estramustine, an estradiol-17 beta and nornitrogen mustard complex, is used in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma. A specific estramustine binding protein (EMBP) is important for its cytotoxic action, and the presence of EMBP has previously been demonstrated in rat and human prostatic cancer tissue. Significant levels of EMBP were detected by radioimmunoassay in human brain-tumor tissue. The EMBP concentrations (expressed as ng/mg protein) in 16 astrocytomas (mean 2.6 ng/mg, range 0.5 to 6.2 ng/mg) and seven meningiomas (mean 5.1 ng/mg, range 0.3 to 9.3 ng/mg) were significantly higher than that found in four samples of epileptic brain (mean 0.7 ng/mg, range 0.5 to 1 ng/mg) and 18 samples of normal brain (mean 0.5 ng/mg, range 0.2 to 1.0 ng/mg). The uptake, metabolism, and antiproliferative effects of the prostatic anticancer agent estramustine have been previously demonstrated in cultured glioma cells. The presence of EMBP may suggest a selective binding and effectiveness in human brain-tumor tissue. \nDetermination of pulse wave velocities with computerized algorithms. Careful determination of pulse wave velocity is important in the study of arterial viscoelastic properties, wave reflections, and ventricular-arterial interactions. In spite of its increasingly widespread use, there is as yet no standardized method for its determination. Most studies have manually identified the transit time of the pressure wave front as it travels over a known distance in the arterial system, but the issues of accuracy and reproducibility have not been addressed. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of four computerized algorithms in the determination of pulse wave velocities in invasive as well as in noninvasive pressure determinations. The four methods were the identification of: (1) the point of minimum diastolic pressure, (2) the point at which the first derivative of pressure is maximum, (3) the point at which the second derivative of pressure is maximum, and (4) the point yielded by the intersection of a line tangent to the initial systolic upstroke of the pressure tracing and a horizontal line through the minimum point. High-fidelity aortic pressure recordings were obtained in 26 patients with a multi-sensor micromanometer catheter. Noninvasive brachial and radial pressure waveforms were recorded in 11 volunteers with external piezoelectric transducers. The results show that the first derivative method consistently provided results that were different from the other methods for both the invasive and noninvasive methods because of changes in the structure of the upstroke as the arterial pulse propagates distally. Although the minimum method worked well for the invasive determinations, it was erratic with the noninvasive determinations, probably because of the higher amount of noise and reflection in the latter. Among the four algorithms, the second derivative and the intersecting tangents methods worked well with both invasive and noninvasive determinations with mean variation coefficients of less than 7% and correlation coefficients between the methods of greater than 0.90 for all data. In conclusion, computerized algorithms allow accurate determination of pulse wave velocity in invasively and noninvasively measured arterial pressure waveforms. \nCT of the gastrointestinal tract: principles and interpretation. The experience accumulated in daily abdominal CT scanning and CT evaluation of gastrointestinal lesions has generated helpful technical guidelines and some reliable principles of interpretation. These general principles are briefly discussed in this review, and the importance of performing a CT examination that is adequate for the detection and evaluation of gastrointestinal lesions is stressed. CT features useful in differentiating benign from malignant lesions, limitations and pitfalls in CT interpretation, overlap in the CT appearance, and classical CT features leading to specific diagnoses are described and illustrated. Although CT is established as one of the most important techniques for imaging the gastrointestinal tract, it should be used selectively and only in the context of appropriate clinical and conventional radiologic examination. CT should not be regarded as competing with, but as complementing, barium examination of the gastrointestinal tract. \nVisual field defects in diabetic patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. We reviewed the automated visual field tests of 110 nondiabetic and 87 diabetic patients with primary open-angle glaucoma randomly selected from a large glaucoma practice to investigate a possible qualitative difference in the pattern of visual field defects between nondiabetic and diabetic patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. A single reviewer analyzed, in masked fashion, the visual field tests of each patient and decided whether or not visual field defects were present mainly in the inferior half of the visual field. Of the 110 nondiabetic patients, 40 (36.4%) had visual field defects located mainly in the inferior half of the visual field in one or both eyes, whereas 56 of the 87 (64.4%) diabetic patients had such defects. This difference was statistically significant (P = .0001). We believe that a vascular factor, such as that attributable to diabetes mellitus, may influence glaucomatous optic nerve damage, thus causing a difference in the pattern of visual field loss in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. \nC6 glioma-astrocytoma cell and fetal astrocyte migration into artificial basement membrane: a permissive substrate for neural tumors but not fetal astrocytes. Cortically homografted C6 glioma-astrocytoma cells both invade the rat host brain as a mass and migrate as individual cells. In contrast, fetal astrocytes derived from homografted whole pieces of fetal cortex migrate only as individual cells throughout the brain of the rat but are not capable of invasion. Our experiment explored the migratory capacity (over 7 days) of cultured purified fetal astrocytes and C6 cells after seeding 10(6) cells on a hydrated artificial basement membrane wafer (Matrigel). The artificial basement membrane wafer was not a suitable substrate for the growth of cultured fetal astrocytes. In contrast, C6 cells migrated as individual cells from the surface of the wafer into the substrate. Individual C6 cells migrated 1.8 mm in the first 4 days and then ceased migration. The C6 cells were observed at the base of a digestion tube that extended from and was open to the surface of the wafer. At 3 days, micropockets were observed to form around each C6 cell at the base of each tube. By 7 days, the majority of pockets observed were large and contained several C6 cells. These multiple cell groups appeared to be progenitors of tumor masses. These data indicate that C6 glioma-astrocytoma cells, which in vivo appear to be a model for glioblastoma multiforme, primarily migrate as individual cells through artificial basement membrane and secondarily form tumor masses. Progenitor tumor masses form by coalescence of individual C6 cell micropockets or the division of a single cell in an individual micropocket. \nLiver metastases: results of percutaneous ethanol injection in 14 patients. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) was performed under ultrasound (US) guidance in the outpatient department in 14 patients with 21 metastases 1.0-3.8 cm in diameter. The primary cancer was colorectal adenocarcinoma (seven patients), adenocarcinoma of the stomach (four patients), abdominal leiomyosarcoma (one patient), gastrinoma of unknown origin (one patient), and bronchial carcinoid (one patient). The indicators of therapeutic efficacy were US, computed tomography, fine-needle biopsy, and serologic markers. No complications occurred after a total of 175 treatment sessions. Complete response was obtained in 11 lesions, nine of which were less than 2 cm in diameter, and in all endocrine metastases (four lesions in two patients) with a maximum, recurrence-free follow-up of 38 months. Carcinoembryonic antigen values decreased in all patients but one for a 2-6-month period. The natural course of metastatic disease strictly limits the applicability of PEI, a local treatment. Single, metachronous, nonoperable metastasis of adenocarcinoma and endocrine metastases seem to be the only indications for PEI. \nTheophylline-associated seizures with \"therapeutic\" or low toxic serum concentrations: risk factors for serious outcome in adults. We report 12 adults with seizures associated with serum theophylline levels between 14 and 35 mg/l. The seizures were frequently prolonged, and outcome was generally poor with eight deaths. Although we did not identify comparable control groups, possible risk factors for serious outcome in theophylline-associated seizures were age, previous brain injury or disease, severe pulmonary disease, and possibly low serum albumin level. In patients with these risk factors, serum theophylline levels should be maintained below 10 to 15 mg/l. \nMultivessel PTCA using the hugging balloon technique based on single guide catheter and dual balloon-on-a-wire systems. For percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of oversized arteries, often-times a satisfactory dilatation cannot be achieved with conventional balloon systems due to the unavailability of adequately sized balloons. This fact has contributed to a higher restenosis rate for this group of patients. We were able to obtain a satisfactory dilatation result in an oversized right coronary artery with a shepherd's crook configuration and eccentric anatomy at the origin using two balloon-on-a-wire systems and an Amplatz type guiding catheter. Although such favorable dilatation of an oversized artery using this \"hugging balloon technique\" can be expected, issues do exist such as difficult maneuverability and estimation of the balloon size obtained through simultaneous dual balloon inflation wherein size does not simply equal the sum of the two balloon catheters. It is hoped that there will be further improvements of the technique and development of new systems. At this time, however, it is felt that this is the most effective and reasonable strategy to achieve a high chance of success in oversized vessel lesions. \nCombined interferon alfa and doxorubicin in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer. Interferon alfa and doxorubicin have been shown to have synergistic effects when tested in vitro with cells derived from cervical cancers. A clinical trial was designed, testing interferon alfa plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancers. Twenty-one patients were given interferon alfa, 10 million units per square meter intramuscularly and 10 million units per square meter intravenously over a 30-minute infusion period. One hour later 20 mg/m2 doxorubicin was given intravenously slowly over a 2-hour period. Treatments were repeated once weekly for 3 weeks. Initial response evaluation was done at week 5, and treatment was continued on an every-other-week schedule for patients showing favorable responses or stable disease. Bone marrow, hepatic, and renal toxicities were minimal. Fever and malaise were the major sources of toxicity. Of the 17 evaluable patients, six had clinical partial responses. Two of the responders have enjoyed more than 5 years' survival. This regimen is well tolerated and does have efficacy in some patients with advanced cervical cancers. \nRepetitive sinoatrial exit block as the major mechanism of drug-provoked long sinus or atrial pause. Prolonged sinus or atrial pause occurred in six patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia after drug administration. All six patients had normal sinus node function during control electrophysiologic study; the sinus cycle length ranged from 510 to 900 ms (mean 743 +/- 141) and the longest sinus node recovery time ranged from 800 to 1,230 ms (mean 1,018 +/- 168). A long sinus or atrial pause occurring at the termination of tachycardia or cessation of atrial pacing, ranging from 3,100 to 8,200 ms (mean 6,270 +/- 1,674), was provoked by the administration of various drugs. These included an intravenous bolus injection of adenosine triphosphate (5 mg; one patient), intravenous bolus injection of verapamil (5 mg; one patient), a combination of a single oral dose of diltiazem (120 mg) and propranolol (20 to 40 mg; three patients), oral diltiazem (240 mg/day; one patient) and a combination of oral diltiazem (240 mg/day) and propranolol (160 mg/day; one patient). In five patients, low frequency deflections suggestive of sinus node activity with a cycle length between 620 and 3,500 ms were recorded during pauses. These findings suggest that repetitive sinoatrial exit block was responsible for the pause. Sinus slowing with a long arrest suggesting suppression of sinus automaticity was also noted in three of these five patients; the longest sinus arrest in these three patients was 4,160, 4,800 and greater than 4,910 ms, respectively. The remaining patient with a pause of 6,840 ms had no recordable sinus activity, either reflecting suppression of sinus automaticity or technical failure. \nIntracranial aneurysms in sickle-cell anemia: clinical features and pathogenesis. Intracranial aneurysms are an unusual complication of sickle-cell anemia; only 15 patients have been described in the world literature. An additional 15 patients with sickle-cell anemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured intracranial aneurysms are presented. There was a high incidence of multiple aneurysms (60%); some of which were in unusual locations. The clinical and pathological features of this series of patients have provided a paradigm for acquired aneurysm formation that may be applicable to other intracranial aneurysms. Thirteen patients underwent craniotomy and clip ligation; the perioperative management of these patients is discussed. Of these 13, eight had a good recovery, three were left with moderate disability, one patient died of surgical complications, and one died of complications related to sickle-cell anemia. Two of the 15 patients died of SAH. The authors propose that endothelial injury from the abnormal adherence of sickle erythrocytes to the endothelium is the initiating event in arterial wall injury. Subsequently, there is fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina and degeneration of the smooth-muscle layer. Hemodynamic stress at these loci of arterial wall damage results in aneurysm formation. This hypothesis also explains other cerebrovascular manifestations of sickle-cell anemia, namely vaso-occlusive disease and hemor",
