The Nauta method reveals the degeneration not only of nerve fibers, myelinated and unmyelinated, but also of their terminations. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations appear to prove that the Nauta technique indeed stains axons in human autopsy material. The optimal survival time for the use of the Nauta method was found to be between nine days and five months. In cases with longer survival times--up to 20 months--the Nauta technique and a previously proposed polarizing technique (showing birefringent breakdown products of myelin) can be used as complementary methods. Applying these techniques to the human brain may help define the anatomical basis of neurological and neuropsychological symptoms important for man. \nBrain natriuretic peptide as a novel cardiac hormone in humans. Evidence for an exquisite dual natriuretic peptide system, atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide. Using a specific radioimmunoassay for human brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP) with a monoclonal antibody, we have investigated its synthesis, secretion, and clearance in comparison with those of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in normal subjects and patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Mean BNP-like immunoreactivity (-LI) levels in normal atrium and ventricle were 250 and 18 pmol/g, respectively. The plasma BNP-LI level in normal subjects was 0.90 +/- 0.07 fmol/ml, which was 16% of the ANP-LI level. In contrast, the plasma BNP-LI level markedly increased in patients with CHF in proportion to its severity, and surpassed the ANP-LI level in severe cases. There was a significant step-up of the plasma BNP-LI level in the coronary sinus (CS) compared with that in the aortic root (Ao) and the difference between these BNP-LI levels, delta(CS-Ao)BNP, also increased with the severity of CHF. In addition, the step-up of the BNP-LI level in the anterior interventricular vein [delta(AIV-Ao)BNP] was comparable to delta(CS-Ao)BNP, indicating that BNP is secreted mainly from the ventricle. Predominant BNP synthesis in the ventricle was also confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Catheterization and pharmacokinetic studies revealed that hBNP is cleared from the circulation more slowly than alpha-hANP; this was in part attributed to lower (about 7%) binding affinity of hBNP to clearance receptors than that of alpha-hANP. A predominant molecular form of BNP-LI in the heart and plasma was a 3-kD form corresponding to hBNP. These results indicate that BNP is a novel cardiac hormone secreted predominantly from the ventricle, and that the synthesis, secretion and clearance of BNP differ from those of ANP, suggesting discrete physiological and pathophysiological roles of BNP in a dual natriuretic peptide system. \nA pair of monozygotic twins who are concordant for myasthenia gravis but became discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus post-thymectomy. We describe a pair of monozygotic twins who are concordant for myasthenia gravis but discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE developed in twin 1 18 years post-thymectomy and has been characterized by recurrent transverse myelitis and optic neuritis. Twin 2 remains well post-thymectomy, except for a skin rash and persistent leukopenia. Both twins have developed autoimmune thyroid disease. We review genetic and environmental factors of importance in the pathogenesis of SLE and discuss the possible role of thymectomy in the etiology of the disease. \nIncidence of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients treated with sucralfate or cimetidine as prophylaxis for stress bleeding: bacterial colonization of the stomach. Retrograde colonization of the oropharynx from the stomach by microaspiration of gastric fluid is a recently recognized phenomenon associated with increased gastric pH that may result in pneumonia during ventilation therapy. In a prospective study we investigated 104 mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit who were receiving sucralfate (n = 49) or cimetidine (n = 55) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The incidence of pneumonia was 45.5% (25 patients) in the cimetidine group and 26.5% (13 patients) in the sucralfate group (95% confidence interval 0.98 to 6.97; odds ratio 2.61; p = 0.0549). Mortality rates were 18.4% (9 patients) in the sucralfate group versus 25.5% (14 patients) in the cimetidine group (p = 0.48). The mean pH values of gastric aspirates were significantly lower in patients treated with sucralfate than in patients receiving cimetidine (p = 0.044). The number of colony-forming units of Enterobacteriaceae in gastric aspirates was also significantly lower in the sucralfate group (p = 0.0037). \nA randomized trial of a single bolus dosage regimen of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Experiments in animals have demonstrated that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) produces continuing thrombolysis after it is cleared from the circulation and that thrombolysis is both increased and accelerated, and bleeding is reduced when rt-PA is administered over a short period. In previous studies in patients with thrombotic disease, rt-PA has been shown to be an effective thrombolytic agent when administered by continuous infusion over a period between 90 minutes and 8 hours. To determine whether a short course regimen of rt-PA can achieve thrombolysis, a double-blind randomized trial has been conducted in which patients with objectively established acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism who were receiving heparin were allocated to either a 2-minute infusion of rt-PA at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (33 patients) or saline placebo (25 patients). Perfusion lung scanning was used to assess the change in pulmonary perfusion at 24 hours and seven days post-study drug administration. Thirty-four percent of the rt-PA patients had a greater than 50 percent resolution in the perfusion defect at 24 hours compared to 12 percent of placebo patients (p = 0.026). At 24 hours, the mean relative improvement in the perfusion defect was 37.0 percent in rt-PA treated patients compared to 18.8 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.017). By day 7, no difference in lung scan resolution was detected between the groups. There were no major bleeds in either group nor were there any differences in transfusion requirements between groups. Minor bleeding occurred in 15 of the rt-PA patients mainly at angiogram-catheter insertion and venipuncture sites. These results suggest that a bolus regimen of rt-PA produces accelerated thrombolysis and provides an alternative and convenient approach to thrombolytic therapy in patients with pulmonary embolism. \nEndoscopic surgery for lacrimal obstruction. Intranasal access to the lacrimal drainage system has been greatly enhanced with the advent of endoscopic nasal surgery. This technique has been used for the treatment of recurrent lacrimal obstruction after failed external dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) in 12 patients. Improved intranasal visualization with the endoscope allowed easy identification and opening of the lacrimal sac, with no need for a skin incision. Obstructing intranasal pathology, including adhesions from previous DCR, an enlarged middle turbinate, and ethmoid sinus disease, was readily identified and corrected. There were no intraoperative complications. Lacrimal obstruction was completely relieved in nine of 12 patients (75%), with a followup of 7 to 25 months. Endoscopic revision DCR should be considered in patients with recurrent epiphora after external DCR. \nComposition of atherosclerotic plaques in the four major epicardial coronary arteries in patients greater than or equal to 90 years of age. The composition of atherosclerotic plaques in 733 five-mm segments of the 4 major (left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex and right) epicardial coronary arteries of 18 patients greater than or equal to 90 years of age was determined by computerized planimetric analysis. By analysis of all coronary segments of all patients greater than 90, the plaques consisted primarily of fibrous tissue (87 +/- 8%) with calcific deposits (7 +/- 6%), pultaceous debris (5 +/- 4%) and foam cells (1 +/- 1%) occupying a much smaller percentage of plaque area. Analysis of composition according to the 4 degrees of luminal cross-sectional area narrowing revealed marked step-wise increases in pultaceous debris (from 0 +/- 0% at 0 to 25% narrowing to 18 +/- 22% at 76 to 100% narrowing, p = 0.0001) and calcific deposits (from 0 +/- 0 to 10 +/- 15%, p = 0.002), and decreases in fibrous tissue (from 99 +/- 3 to 71 +/- 23%, p = 0.0001) and area occupied by the media (from 35 +/- 8 to 16 +/- 8%, p = 0.0001). When the analysis was restricted to sections narrowed greater than 75%, no significant differences were found in plaque components or medial area between patients with (11 patients) and without (7 patients) myocardial infarcts at necropsy. \nAdenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas: a clinicopathologic study. A total of eight patients with adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas were studied clinicopathologically. Histochemical and immunohistochemical studies were also done. The 8 patients were composed of 4 men and 4 women with a mean age of 56 years, which was 9 years younger than for other pancreatic carcinoma. The site of origin and size of the tumors were similar to those of usual pancreatic carcinoma. Histopathologically, all eight tumors showed an abrupt transition between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma was located at the periphery of the tumors. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry disclosed a different nature for both components. The cumulative 1-year survival rate of the 8 patients was 21.4%, compared to 42.1% of 72 with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The survival curve of the 8 patients with adenosquamous carcinoma was significantly less favorable than that of 36 patients with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. These facts support the view that squamous cell carcinoma in adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas is squamous cell metaplasia of the pre-existing adenocarcinoma. The clinical course of adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas was unfavorable. \nUnexplained chest pain and breathlessness. Complaints of chest pain and breathlessness are common in both primary care and medical outpatient settings. A subgroup of these patients who find their way into tertiary care settings and subsequently are found to have no relevant organic pathology are at risk of continuing morbidity. One possible reason for this is that diagnostic strategies often focus on establishing an organic cause of pain and ignore psychosocial factors. In this article I have attempted to describe not only the prevalence but also the clinical characteristics of patients with medically unexplained cardiorespiratory symptoms. A method of establishing a positive diagnosis of noncardiac chest pain has also been outlined. This is based on an interactive and overlapping model that takes into account not only a number of psychological and social factors but also current physical and cardiac risk factors. It is important for nonpsychiatric physicians to diagnose noncardiac pain at an earlier stage in the evolution of the disorder. This would have major beneficial effects for patients, including (1) fewer unnecessary investigations; (2) less distress and functional disability; (3) reduced cost to the hospital; and (4) fewer iatrogenic complications. \nTrial of flecainide acetate in the management of tinnitus. A two-phase trial of flecainide acetate in the management of tinnitus has been carried out in 22 patients with severe long-term tinnitus resistant to other treatments. Although 5 (23%) patients reported some limited benefit the results are not conclusive but suggest that, for such patients, flecainide deserves a place as a drug worth considering as a last resort, with the prospect of it occasionally giving a worthwhile degree of relief. \nPrimary Raynaud's phenomenon in early childhood. Three young children, aged 17 months, 26 months and 29 months, presented with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. One was treated with nifedipine. Raynaud's phenomenon is rare in children and as a result experience in its treatment limited. Previously reported cases of childhood Raynaud's are reviewed, and approaches to management discussed. \nSix-year follow-up of early physiotherapy intervention in very low birth weight infants. Eighty very low birth weight infants assigned to neurologically normal or at-risk groups on the basis of a neurodevelopmental score were previously described. Infants were assigned to physiotherapy or control groups, and the effect of physiotherapy was assessed at 1 year. At-risk infants had a significantly lower developmental quotient than the normal group and no beneficial effect of physiotherapy was shown. Of the original 80 subjects, 49 were reassessed at a mean age of 74.7 months. As observed previously, physiotherapy until 1 year did not influence subsequent outcome in either normal or at-risk children. At-risk and normal children had similar mean developmental quotients at 6 years, but the locomotor score of at-risk children was significantly below that of normal children. Cerebral palsy occurred in 6 of 24 at-risk vs 0 of 25 normal subjects (P less than .01) and remedial therapy was recommended in 17 of 24 at-risk subjects vs 6 of 25 normal subjects (P less than .001). These results confirm that the neurodevelopmental score predicts a risk for either cerebral palsy or soft neurological problems, and early physiotherapy is of questionable benefit in preventing such problems. \nDextran-70 versus albumin as plasma expanders in cirrhotic patients with tense ascites treated with total paracentesis. Results of a randomized study To investigate whether albumin can be substituted by less expensive plasma expanders in cirrhotic patients with tense ascites treated with total paracentesis, 88 patients (16 with renal failure) submitted to this therapeutic procedure were randomly assigned to receive IV albumin (43 patients) or dextran-70. Both substances were given at a dose of 8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed. Patients were discharged from the hospital with diuretics, and cases developing tense ascites during follow-up were treated according to their initial schedule. Total paracentesis was effective in eliminating the ascites in all but two cases in each group. Neither paracentesis plus IV albumin infusion nor paracentesis plus IV dextran-70 infusion was associated with significant changes in renal and hepatic function or serum electrolytes. The incidence of renal impairment (one case in each group), hyponatremia (three and four cases, respectively), and other complications (hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, bacterial infections) after paracentesis, and the clinical course of the disease as estimated by the probability of readmission to hospital during follow-up, causes of readmission, probability of survival, and causes of death were similar in the two groups of patients. The effect of paracentesis on effective intravascular volume was indirectly assessed by measuring plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration before and 2 and 6 days after treatment, the patients being without diuretics. In patients treated with albumin, no significant changes in renin and aldosterone were observed during the entire period of observation. In contrast, both parameters increased significantly on the 6th day of treatment in patients receiving dextran-70. A significant increase in plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration (30% over baseline values) was observed in 51% of patients treated with dextran-70 and in only 15% of those treated with albumin (x2 = 10.4; P = 0.0012). These results indicate that although dextran-70 is less efficacious than albumin in protecting cirrhotic patients treated with total paracentesis from the decrease in effective intravascular volume, it appears to be capable of preventing the renal and electrolyte complications induced by this therapeutic procedure. \nDiarrhea in children newly enrolled in day-care centers in Houston. Diarrhea is a common illness among children in day-care centers (DCC). We hypothesized that the incidence of diarrhea was greater among children in their first 1 or 2 months after enrollment in a DCC than in any subsequent period in day care. We followed 442 children younger than 2 years of age enrolled in 13 randomly selected DCCs for the occurrence of diarrhea during a 14 1/2-month period. Parents completed standardized baseline questionnaires and research nurses visited the DCC twice weekly to record the occurrence of diarrhea and to collect stool specimens. Incidence rates, rate ratios, chi square statistics and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for crude and stratified analyses. The diarrheal incidence rate of 4.4 cases/child-year in the first 4 weeks in the centers was significantly (rate ratio, 1.6; confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.1; P less than 0.01) higher than the 2.7 cases/child-year incidence rate of diarrhea in subsequent weeks. The effects of gender, ethnicity, age, DCC size, previous DCC attendance and season were examined and did not account for the association observed between recent enrollement and risk of diarrheal illness. Rotavirus was identified in 18% of cases of diarrhea, but no association was seen with recent enrollment in DCC. A significantly higher incidence of diarrhea occurred in males compared with females (P less than 0.002) and in younger children (P less than 0.001) compared with older children. Diarrhea is common in children in DCCs and occurs significantly more frequently in children during their first 4 weeks in a DCC. \nThe influence of zinc status and malnutrition on immunological function in Crohn's disease. Cellular immunity is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease; whether it is abnormal is not clear. The heterogeneity of patients with Crohn's disease probably underlies the disparity of reports, but attempts to determine which clinical features influence cellular immunity have been largely unsuccessful. This is probably caused by the omission of nutritional status as a potential factor, even though zinc deficiency has frequently been linked with abnormal immunity. Therefore, a detailed study of nutritional and tissue zinc status, nonspecific cellular immunity, and a measure of phagocytic function was performed in 32 patients with Crohn's disease and in a control group of 18 normal subjects and 12 patients with anorexia nervosa. Fourteen patients with Crohn's disease, all patients with anorexia nervosa, but none of the normal controls were malnourished. Peripheral blood lymphocyte population levels were normal in patients with Crohn's disease and in normal controls, but there was a small decrease in the levels of patients with anorexia nervosa. In vivo delayed hypersensitivity skin test responses were profoundly depressed in patients with anorexia nervosa and decreased in patients with Crohn's disease who were malnourished or receiving systemic glucocorticoids. In vitro lymphocyte transformation was reduced in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease, but there were only minor changes in patients with anorexia nervosa. There were alterations of in vitro immunoregulation in Crohn's disease, but they were not responsible for the abnormal lymphocyte transformation responses in malnourished patients. In vitro phagocytic function was reduced in patients with active Crohn's disease. These findings suggest that depressed in vivo and in vitro cellular immunity in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease is caused by a qualitative lymphocyte defect and that depressed in vivo but normal in vitro cellular immunity in anorexia nervosa is caused by a quantitative defect. Thus, malnutrition in Crohn's disease resembles kwashiorkor; in anorexia nervosa, it resembles marasmus. Tissue zinc status was mostly normal in Crohn's disease and anorexia nervosa, and zinc deficiency was not responsible for depressed nonspecific cellular immunity in either condition. \nPrealbumin in the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumours. The reliability of prealbumin as a diagnostic marker was studied in 60 cases of bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumours. There were differences in the incidence of positivity between typical and atypical carcinoids (well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas). Seventy five per cent of the carcinoid tumours were positive for prealbumin; (86.7% typical and 63.3% atypical carcinoids). In 15 cases, which were Grimelius negative, 10 were prealbumin positive. Only 8.3% carcinoids were negative with both prealbumin and Grimelius stains. Ten squamous, 10 adeno- and 10 small cell carcinomas showed only occasional scattered prealbumin positive cells. It is concluded that prealbumin is a useful marker for bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumours. It is cheap, readily available, and should be considered part of routine diagnostic procedures for the diagnosis of carcinoid tumours. \nHemifacial spasm in an infant due to fourth ventricular ganglioglioma. Case report. The case of an infant is reported in which hemifacial spasm due to a ganglioglioma of the fourth ventricle was relieved by surgery. Previously described causes of hemifacial spasm are summarized, and the relevance of this case to theories on the pathogenesis of the condition is discussed. \nEconomies of scale, physician volume for urology patients, and DRG prospective hospital payment system. Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) hospital payment has begun to squeeze hospitals financially and is likely to do so in the future. This study analyzed the relationship between the volume of urologic procedures by an individual urologist, hospital costs per patient, and outcome. We used a three-year DRG database of urology patients (N = 2,980) at an academic medical center to analyze these. Low-volume urologists (arbitrarily defined by us) had higher hospital costs per patient, financial losses versus profits under DRGs, and a poorer outcome when compared with high-volume urologists. Pearson correlation showed a positive relationship between cost per patient and physician volume for nonemergency patients (-0.129, p less than 0.0001) and emergency patients (-0.368, p less than 0.0001). This may have been explained (in part) by a greater severity of illness for patients of low-volume urologists. These findings suggest, however, that the volume of urologic procedures per urologist may be related to hospital resource consumption. The health care financing environment of the future should provide substantial interest in this finding for those involved in the consumption of urologic services. \nCerebrospinal fluid tumour markers in patients treated for meningeal malignancy. The results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical markers were compared with conventional CSF cytology in patients treated for leptomeningeal metastases from extra cranial malignancies. For lumbar CSF, before treatment, no statistically significant difference of the probabilities of being positive was found between CSF cytology and a classification by linear discriminant analysis, based on patient's age, of beta-glucuronidase and beta 2-microglobulin. During treatment, classification by linear discriminant analysis was found more often positive than cytology. Possible mechanisms for this difference are discussed. For ventricular CSF a correlation was found between CSF cytology and beta-glucuronidase for solid tumours, and between CSF cytology and beta 2-microglobulin for haematological malignancies. Reference values for ventricular protein, CEA beta-glucuronidase and beta 2-microglobulin were obtained for cytological negative samples. \nBlood pressure dysregulation associated with alcohol withdrawal. Alcoholics' blood pressures (BP) are typically elevated during withdrawal. Do such elevations predict future blood pressure dysregulation or are they simply a transitory effect of alcohol toxicity? Thirty-two patients admitted to the hospital for alcohol detoxification were tested to examine the relationship between admission BP and response to isometric handgrip administered 4 to 5 days (session 1) and 3 to 4 weeks (session 2) postdetoxification. Alcoholics were divided into three groups based on admission BPs: Hypertensive (HT, greater than or equal to 160/95 mmHg), Borderline Hypertensive (BHT, 140/90-159/94 mmHg), and Normotensive (NT, less than 140/90 mmHg). In sessions 1 and 2, the groups no longer differed on resting BP or heart rate (HR) but did differ on BP and HR response to handgrip: Compared with the NT group, the HT and BHT groups had greater rises in systolic and diastolic BP and HR. There was a trend for HT alcoholics to report a positive parental history of hypertension (91%) compared to BHT and NT alcoholics (64% and 60%, respectively), suggesting the existence of premorbid factors to this exaggerated cardiovascular response. Further, alcohol consumption, based on a quantity-frequency index, was significantly higher in the HT group than in the NT group. The results suggest that transitory elevations in blood pressure observed during alcohol withdrawal may predict future BP abnormalities. \nLichen sclerosus et atrophicus, morphea, and coexistence of both diseases. Histological studies using lectins. Histological studies using three lectins, lens culinaris agglutinin, soybean agglutinin, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I, were carried out in a case of coexistent lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and morphea, five cases of morphea, and two cases of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. The lectin staining patterns of the formaldehyde-fixed epidermis of patients with morphea were not different from those of normal epidermis, but epidermis of patients with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus showed different staining patterns. Lens culinaris agglutinin stained the basal and the spinous layers of the normal epidermis and that of patients with morphea but stained only the basal cells of the epidermis from patients with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus; epidermal Ulex europaeus agglutinin binding was observed only in the cases of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. Moreover, in the patient with coexistent diseases, the morphea lesion showed the staining profiles of morphea and the lichen sclerosus et atrophicus lesion showed the staining patterns of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, respectively. \nTransient porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. We report a case of acquired porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. Thrombosis of the portal vein and hepatic artery led to massive necrosis of the patient's first donor liver, necessitating its removal. After an 18-hour anhepatic period, a second donor liver was transplanted. During this interval, the patient was warmed with an infrared heat lamp that emitted bright visible light. Following the anhepatic period, a photodistributed cutaneous erythema was noted. The level of total serum porphyrins during the anhepatic period was significantly elevated at 1.548 mumol/L (normal, less than 0.018 mumol/L). Fractionation showed that the levels of the hydrophobic porphyrins, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin, were elevated, while the levels of the hydrophilic porphyrins remained normal. Following the successful second liver transplantation, the patient's porphyrin levels declined. This is the first reported case of acquired porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient. \nThrombus within a submitral left ventricular aneurysm: diagnosis on cross sectional echocardiography. Subvalvar left ventricular aneurysms are rare and occur predominantly in black Africans. A submitral left ventricular aneurysm was diagnosed on cross sectional echocardiography in a black woman born in the United Kingdom. The left parasternal long axis view showed a highly echogenic mass apparently attached to the wall of a dilated left atrium, but the apical two-chamber view showed that this was thrombus in the apex of a left ventricular aneurysm. The patient subsequently underwent surgical correction. \nInteraction between methotrexate, \"rescue\" agents and cell proliferation as modulators of homocysteine export from cells in culture. Clinical studies on cancer and psoriasis patients have shown that plasma and urinary homocysteine (Hcy) responds to methotrexate (MTX) therapy, indicating that Hcy in extracellular fluids may be an indicator of the antifolate effect. However, the clinical data indicate that the burden of proliferating cells, cytotoxicity and the folate status are also determinants of extracellular Hcy. To evaluate this further, we investigated the modulation of cellular Hcy egress by MTX, rescue agents, cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Nontransformed and chemically transformed fibroblasts and murine lymphoma cells, which are characterized by different growth behavior and MTX response, were used. The Hcy export rate was correlated positively with the proliferation rate in all cell types. 5-Formyltetrahydrofolate or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate added to fibroblasts not exposed to MTX reduced the Hcy export rate, whereas the export from the lymphoma cells was not affected. All cells types exposed to MTX were rescued by thymidine + hypoxanthine, and this allowed the assessment of Hcy export during MTX exposure without interference from cytotoxicity. In the fibroblasts, MTX with thymidine + hypoxanthine rescue induced a marked increase in Hcy export, and the dose-response paralleled the cytotoxicity curves obtained for MTX without rescue. Nontoxic concentrations of MTX without rescue enhanced the Hcy export. When MTX concentration was increased further, Hcy export was stimulated initially, and then declined rapidly as cell death ensued. MTX did not enhance the Hcy export from the lymphoma cells and, in the absence of rescue, the Hcy export from these cells declined in proportion to inhibition of cell growth. \nThe causes of esophageal symptoms in human immunodeficiency virus infection. A prospective study of 110 patients. STUDY OBJECTIVES.--To determine the prevalence of infectious agents in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and odynophagia or dysphagia; the utility of endoscopic, histologic, cytologic, and virologic testing for the diagnosis of esophagitis; and the yield of blind brushings of the esophagus in this setting. DESIGN.--Prospective clinical case study. SETTING.--Urban county hospital. PATIENTS.--One hundred ten consecutive patients with esophageal symptoms and documented human immunodeficiency virus infection. INTERVENTION.--Blind brushing of the esophagus via orogastric tube followed by endoscopy with esophageal brushing for fungal stain, Papanicolau smear, and viral cultures and esophageal biopsies for histologic examination and viral culture. MAIN RESULTS.--Seventy-two (65%) of the 110 patients had a total of 100 esophageal infections. Thirty-three (30%) had Candida alone, 22 (20%) had Candida and cytomegalovirus, two (1.8%) had Candida with cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus, seven (6%) had cytomegalovirus alone, six (5%) had herpes simplex virus alone, and two (1.8%) had both viruses. Fifty of 55 patients with plaques alone had Candida, and two (4%) had only viral infection. Of 19 patients with erosions or ulcers, 11 (58%) had a viral infection, two (11%) had Candida alone, and six (30%) had no etiologic agent identified. The sensitivity of endoscopic brushings (95%) was better than that of histologic examination (70%) in the diagnosis of Candida esophagitis. Likewise, viral cultures of brushings or biopsy specimens were more sensitive (67%) than histologic examination (35%) for viral esophagitis. Blind brushing of the esophagus had a sensitivity and specificity for infectious esophagitis of 84% and 75%, respectively. Oral thrush had a sensitivity of 53% and a positive predictive value of 77% for Candida esophagitis. \nEffect of intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase on autologous arterial emboli in the cerebral circulation of rabbits [corrected] [published erratum appears in Stroke 1991 Feb;22(2):285] We conducted a randomized, blinded controlled trial to test the efficacy of fibrinolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase in the treatment of acute embolic stroke. Embolic stroke was simulated in rabbits by injecting three 0.5 x 0.5 mm fragments of autologous arterial thrombus harvested from a traumatized auricular artery. Thirty minutes after embolization the rabbits were blindly treated with tissue plasminogen activator (n = 21), urokinase (n = 20), or 0.9% saline (n = 20). At 6 hours the rabbits were sacrificed, and the cerebral vasculature was inspected for the location and number of emboli. The brain was then cut into 0.5-cm-thick coronal sections and stained with triphenyltetrazolium chloride to define areas of infarction. Treatment with either tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase significantly reduced the number of emboli present in the cerebral circulation (p less than 0.05). The area of ischemic injury was also significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) by acute fibrinolytic therapy with either tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase. However, only treatment with tissue plasminogen activator significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) the incidence of infarction. There was no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage in any rabbit. Early fibrinolytic therapy improved outcome in this model of acute embolic stroke. \nCharacterizing organic delusional syndrome. We present a first comprehensive description of the clinical features of patients with organic delusional syndrome. This description is based on information from 39 patients with organic delusional syndrome among 14,889 patients who presented for initial evaluation over a 5-year period at our institution. This description includes an enumeration of the common clinical symptoms of this syndrome and the respective prevalence and mean severity of each symptom. The severity of the symptoms of organic delusional syndrome are compared with those of schizophrenia to determine which symptoms distinguish between these two diagnostic categories. Patients with organic delusional syndrome demonstrated significantly more symptoms of \"acquired intellectual impairment,\" \"impaired sensorium,\" and \"hallucinations of smell, taste, or touch,\" while schizophrenic patients demonstrated more \"flat affect,\" \"emotional coldness,\" and \"thought disorganization.\" In addition, associated factors are presented concerning demographics, modes of treatment, level of functioning, and current physical problems associated with organic delusional syndrome. \nCorrelation between histology and nerve excitability after reinnervation of paralyzed strap muscles in the rabbit. We have recently shown that the mean muscle chronaxie for nerve pedicle implanted into denervated rabbit strap muscle is comparable to that of normal nerve. This study correlates excitability with histologic characteristics of muscles reinnervated via nerve-muscle pedicles (NMP) and direct nerve implants (DNI). Strength duration curves were measured in 13 rabbits 3.5 to 5 months after reinnervation by NMP (n = 6) and DNI (n = 7). Following this, control (n = 5) and reinnervated straps were harvested immediately before the animals were killed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The material was submitted for hematoxylin-eosin stains as well as trichrome stains for general morphology, myofibrillar ATPase and NADH for fiber typing, and cholinesterase for determination of denervated fibers. In all animals with low chronaxie, expected type grouping from reinnervation was noted (n = 10). By contrast, the three animals in which chronaxie was abnormally elevated demonstrated fibrosis, inflammation, and absence of or poor type grouping. This suggests that type grouping is necessary for excitability after reinnervation of paralyzed striated muscles. \nClenbuterol plus acivicin decrease tumor growth and increase muscle mass in rats maintained on total parenteral nutrition. Two problems associated with supplemental nutrition of tumor-bearing organisms are control of tumor growth and reduction of cachexia. To investigate these problems, rats bearing methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas were maintained on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 10 to 12 days beginning 23 days after tumor inoculation. Combined treatment of one group of these rats with the glutamine antimetabolite, acivicin, and the beta 2-adrenergic agonist, clenbuterol, arrested tumor growth, increased skeletal muscle mass and protein content, increased gut mass, and decreased total plasma lipid levels. Resting energy expenditure and cardiac mass were increased by TPN and were increased further by acivicin plus clenbuterol. These results demonstrate that tumor growth and muscle wasting can be controlled during TPN of tumor-bearing organisms. Therefore, cachectic depletion of lean body tissue may not be obligatory in neoplastic disease. \nJaw pain and tenderness levels during and after repeated sustained maximum voluntary protrusion. Eight normal male volunteers performed 4 repeated sustained voluntary isometric protrusive jaw muscle contractions of 25, 50, 75 and 100% of maximum effort. Each contraction was sustained until maximum pain tolerance was reached, and all 4 contractions were completed within a single 120-min experimental period. A 30-min rest period followed each sustained contraction. The following measurements were made before and 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after the experiment: (1) superficial masseter and anterior temporalis muscle pain threshold; (2) maximum active pain-free jaw opening and lateral excursion; and (3) current overall jaw pain level. None of these measurements showed any significant post-experimental changes. Contrary to common clinical belief, these results suggest that in healthy male subjects, significant jaw pain and tenderness following repeated sustained isometric protrusion efforts are difficult to induce. \nCT-guided percutaneous transpedicular biopsy of the spine. Occasionally, vertebral body lesions are encountered that are ill suited to the standard posterolateral approach to biopsy. The authors used a transpedicular approach to spine biopsy in six such cases. The authors suggest that this approach be used when the location of the lesion does not allow easy access by means of the posterolateral approach. \nA review of hemoglobin and the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm. We believe that current experimental and clinical evidence can be most satisfactorily interpreted by assuming that oxyhemoglobin is the cause of cerebral vasospasm that follows subarachnoid hemorrhage. We review the pathogenetic mechanisms by which oxyhemoglobin affects cerebral arteries. The relative importance of each of these mechanisms in the genesis of vasospasm, the biochemical pathways of oxyhemoglobin-induced smooth muscle contraction, and the intracellular actions of oxyhemoglobin on smooth muscle and on other cells in arteries are still not definitely established. \nIncidence of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients treated with sucralfate or cimetidine as prophylaxis for stress bleeding: bacterial colonization of the stomach. Retrograde colonization of the oropharynx from the stomach by microaspiration of gastric fluid is a recently recognized phenomenon associated with increased gastric pH that may result in pneumonia during ventilation therapy. In a prospective study we investigated 104 mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit who were receiving sucralfate (n = 49) or cimetidine (n = 55) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The incidence of pneumonia was 45.5% (25 patients) in the cimetidine group and 26.5% (13 patients) in the sucralfate group (95% confidence interval 0.98 to 6.97; odds ratio 2.61; p = 0.0549). Mortality rates were 18.4% (9 patients) in the sucralfate group versus 25.5% (14 patients) in the cimetidine group (p = 0.48). The mean pH values of gastric aspirates were significantly lower in patients treated with sucralfate than in patients receiving cimetidine (p = 0.044). The number of colony-forming units of Enterobacteriaceae in gastric aspirates was also significantly lower in the sucralfate group (p = 0.0037). \nEffect of heparin on coronary arterial patency after thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator in acute myocardial infarction. Infarct artery patency rates at 90 minutes after coronary thrombolysis using recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) with and without concurrent heparin anticoagulation have been shown to be comparable. The contribution of heparin to efficacy and safety after thrombolysis with rt-PA is unknown. In this pilot study, 84 patients were treated within 6 hours of onset of acute myocardial infarction (mean of 2.7 hours) with the standard dose of 100 mg of rt-PA over 3 hours. Forty-two patients were randomized to receive additionally immediate intravenous heparin anticoagulation (5,000 U of intravenous bolus followed by 1,000 U/hour titrated to a partial thromboplastin time of 1.5 to 2.0 times control) while 42 patients received rt-PA alone. Coronary angiography performed on day 3 (48 to 72 hours, mean 57) after rt-PA therapy revealed infarct artery patency rates of 71 and 43% in anticoagulated and control patients, respectively (p = 0.015). Recurrent ischemia or infarction, or both, occurred in 3 (7.1%) anticoagulated patients and 5 (11.9%) control patients (difference not significant). Mild, moderate and severe bleeding occurred in 52, 10 and 2% of the group receiving anticoagulation, respectively, and 34, 2 and 0% of patients in the control group, respectively (p = 0.006). These data indicate that after rt-PA therapy of acute myocardial infarction, heparin therapy is associated with substantially higher coronary patency rates 3 days after thrombolysis but is accompanied by an increased incidence of minor bleeding complications. \nPredictors of left atrial thrombus in mitral valve disease OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for left atrial thrombus (LAT) and the prevalence of thrombi in cases of mitral valve disease whose severity was judged to necessitate surgical intervention. DESIGN: Hospital record review of all operative cases from 1982 to 1985. SETTING: A community serving a referral population encompassing 1.5 million people. Only two hospitals in the geographic area performed cardiac surgery, and both hospitals' records were reviewed. PATIENTS: All 372 patients who underwent either mitral valve replacement or open mitral commissurotomy. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (7%) were noted to have LAT at surgery. Five preselected factors were significantly (p less than 0.05) associated with LAT in univariate analysis: female gender, prior history of embolism, prior anticoagulant therapy, mitral stenosis (MS), and atrial fibrillation (AF). In logistic regression analysis, only MS and AF remained as significant independent predictors of LAT. Mitral stenosis patients in sinus rhythm had a relatively low [2.4 +/- 3.3% (observed +/- 95% confidence interval)] likelihood of having an LAT. Likewise, mitral regurgitation patients in sinus rhythm (n = 139) had an extremely low (0.7 +/- 1.4%) prevalence of LAT. In contrast, MS patients in AF (n = 122) had a prevalence of LAT of 18.0 +/- 6.8%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that, overall, LAT in mitral valve disease may be less common than previous studies have suggested. In addition, mitral valve disease patients who remain in sinus rhythm appear to have a low risk of harboring an LAT. Conversely, MS patients, especially those in AF, appear to be at high risk of harboring an LAT. These results may be helpful in formulating strategies for the use of prophylactic anticoagulation in categories of patients with clinically severe mitral valve disease, or perhaps in estimating the likelihood of a cardiac source of embolism in mitral valve disease patients with suspected cerebral or peripheral emboli. \nStereotactic radiosurgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx. Stereotactic radiosurgery using the gamma unit represents a unique neurosurgical treatment method for the management of selected intracranial vascular malformations and tumors. During a closed-skull single-session procedure that focuses 201 individual beams of gamma irradiation, a high-radiation dose is delivered to the lesion, with a steep dose fall-off peripherally. In order to maintain accuracy of delivery, the target must remain fixed in space; hence the skull is engaged by rigid external fixation during treatment. In this report, we document the first extracranial lesion treated with radiosurgery, a recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of Rosenmuller's fossa, and discuss the possible role of radiosurgery in carefully selected head and neck malignancies. \nThe association of IgA glomerulonephritis and thin glomerular basement membrane disease in a hematuric patient: light and electron microscopic and immunofluorescence investigation. A double glomerulopathy (IgA glomerulonephritis [IgAGN] associated with thin glomerular basement membrane disease [TGBMD]) is reported in a 39-year-old woman presenting with macroscopic-microscopic hematuria. Her 3-year-old daughter was also affected by microhematuria of probable glomerular origin. The diagnosis of IgAGN was made by means of immunofluorescence investigation, which showed generalized diffuse mesangial deposits. TGBMD was identified by electron microscopic investigations, which disclosed thinning (up to 160 nm) of basement membrane of several capillary loops and prominence of the lamina densa. Bearing in mind the known frequencies of the two glomerulopathies, their association may not be coincidental, and, therefore, is worthwhile researching in hematuric patients. \nChronic calcific pancreatitis in a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. We report on a patient with chronic calcific pancreatitis associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and we have hypothesized a possible relationship between these two entities. The hyperviscosity of serum in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia may be associated with a viscous pancreatic juice that leads to stone formation. \nAdjusting the dose to the individual response of the patient during the induction of ovulation with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone. To identify the effective dose of intravenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone necessary to induce ovulation in patients with chronic anovulation of diverse etiology, 40 women were subdivided into four groups: idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, normoandrogenic oligomenorrhea, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). During 90 treatment cycles, the dose was the only parameter that was progressively adjusted. The overall ovulation rate per cycle was 100% in IHH, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, and normoandrogenic oligomenorrhea, using only 5 micrograms/90 minutes in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and normoandrogenic oligomenorrhea and up to 7.5 micrograms/90 minutes in IHH. In PCOS, the ovulation rate was 67.6%, using up to 20 micrograms/90 minutes. The lesser degree of effectiveness observed in PCOS can probably be explained by the different basal endocrine profile presented by these subjects. \nEpileptic palatal myoclonus. Palatal myoclonus (PM) is usually caused by lesions of the brainstem. We report a case of PM of focal cortical origin in a patient with epilepsia partialis continua. The PM sometimes occurred in isolation, and at other times was accompanied by unilateral face, neck, and arm twitching. This was documented by both EEG and SPECT. \nNutrition and alcoholic liver disease. While the rate of malnutrition is relatively modest in alcoholic patients without alcoholic liver disease, the rate of malnutrition is virtually 100% in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and/or alcoholic cirrhosis. The reasons for malnutrition in the alcoholic hepatitis patient include various factors such as anorexia, poor diet, malabsorption, and altered metabolic state. When the patient is hospitalized, the malnutrition frequently worsens because of fasting for tests, continued anorexia, and complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with severe acute hepatitis appear to be both hypermetabolic and hypercatabolic, whereas data are much more conflicting concerning patients with more stable liver disease. Most studies suggest that patients with alcoholic liver disease require at least 60 g of protein per day to maintain positive nitrogen balance. Consistent alterations in plasma amino acid profiles occur in alcoholic liver disease, and specialized nutritional formulations have been devised to correct this amino acid profile with the intent of improving overall nutritional status, hepatic encephalopathy, and mortality. The effects of nutritional support (including use of specialized products) on outcome, on acute hepatic encephalopathy, and on chronic or latent portal systemic encephalopathy are reviewed. \nComparison of mastectomy and lumpectomy for medial carcinoma of the breast. The recurrence and five year disease-free survival rates of 86 patients with carcinoma of the breast located in the medial quadrants who had either lumpectomy and radiotherapy or mastectomy were compared. Patients who had lumpectomy and mastectomy were comparable with respect to variables reflecting extent of the disease. One of 54 patients who had lumpectomy had a local recurrence and five had a recurrence regionally or at distant sites. In the group of 32 patients who had a mastectomy, one patient had a local recurrence and an additional four patients had a recurrence at other sites. The five year study disease-free survival rate was 83 per cent for the lumpectomy group and 78 per cent for the mastectomy group. These data suggest that, for medial quadrant lesions, there may be a disease-free survival advantage associated with lumpectomy and radiotherapy over mastectomy. Further study of this treatment modality for this subset of patients seems indicated. \nMechanisms of gastro-oesophageal reflux in cystic fibrosis. Abnormal degrees of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) were detected by 24 hour intraoesophageal pH measurement in 12 of 14 children (mean age 7.9 years; range 5 months-16 years) affected by cystic fibrosis and complaining of symptoms suggesting GOR. These patients underwent combined recording of distal oesophageal motility and intraluminal pH in order to investigate mechanisms of GOR. Inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation was the most common mechanism of reflux in all patients. Other mechanisms (appropriate relaxation or lowered pressure of the lower oesophageal sphincter, increased intragastric pressure) were detected less frequently. Frequency of inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations was significantly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis than in other study groups (symptomatic GOR, GOR disease complicated by respiratory complaints). Inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations occurred with the same frequency in patients with cystic fibrosis and in a group of children with GOR disease complicated by oesophagitis. Abnormalities of distal oesophageal contractions such as decreased amplitude or uncoordinated waves were also recorded in cystic fibrosis patients. Seven patients with cystic fibrosis completed a therapeutic trial for eight weeks consisting of postural treatment and oral cisapride, a new prokinetic drug. The oesophageal acid exposure improved in only three patients. We conclude that pathologic GOR is commonly associated with cystic fibrosis. The predominant reflux mechanism in these patients is a transient inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation rather than a low steady state basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. \nEffects of phosphatidylserine in age-associated memory impairment. We treated 149 patients meeting criteria for age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) for 12 weeks with a formulation of phosphatidylserine (100 mg BC-PS tid) or placebo. Patients treated with the drug improved relative to those treated with placebo on performance tests related to learning and memory tasks of daily life. Analysis of clinical subgroups suggested that persons within the sample who performed at a relatively low level prior to treatment were most likely to respond to BC-PS. Within this subgroup, there was improvement on both computerized and standard neuropsychological performance tests, and also on clinical global ratings of improvement. The results suggest that the compound may be a promising candidate for treating memory loss in later life. \nThe benefit to cost ratio of work-site blood pressure control programs. Reduction in the cost of health care claims among hypertensive employees was examined over a 4-year period after exposure to a 3-year blood pressure control program, to see whether work-site monitoring and counseling produced a subsequent benefit. Hypertensive employees at three experimental sites (N = 183 to 367 subjects) were compared with subjects at a control site (N = 169) who had received no postscreening follow-up or monitoring, and with matched normotensive employees. The cost of subsequent health care claims for hypertensive employees at the experimental sites was lower than claims for those at the control site, but there was no significant difference across the sites in claims for normotensive employees. After adjusting to a standard 1982 dollar, the data showed from $1.89 to $2.72 in reduced health care claims per dollar spent operating the hypertension control program. \nAqueduct block markedly reduces mortality and hypertension in post-deoxycorticosterone acetate Dahl salt-resistant rats. When Dahl salt-resistant (DR) rats are given mild post-deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) hypertension, they will have, within 8 weeks, a 53% mortality on a high NaCl diet, without a rise of blood pressure. Forty-two DR rats were given DOCA in silicone (250 mg/kg) and 1% NaCl to drink. After 4 weeks, the DOCA and 1% saline were removed and replaced with a low NaCl diet and tap water. One week later, they were divided into two groups perfectly matched for blood pressure (154 mm Hg). One group had the aqueduct of Sylvius blocked with silicone and epoxy materials; the other group had a sham block. After 4 more recovery weeks on a low NaCl diet, blood pressure averaged 171 mm Hg in sham rats and 147 mm Hg in truly blocked rats (p less than 0.0001). Thus, the aqueduct block prevented most of the post-DOCA hypertension and permitted a strong post-DOCA recovery from the acute DOCA hypertension. The rats with the sham block had an actual rise in blood pressure during the post-DOCA recovery period. The vicious cycle leading to permanent post-DOCA NaCl hypertension was broken by the aqueduct block. Then both groups began an 8% high NaCl diet, and after 4 weeks, blood pressure averaged 184 mm Hg in sham and 155 mm Hg in truly blocked rats (p less than 0.0001). After 12 weeks on 8% NaCl, all sham rats had died (28 of 28), whereas only one of 14 truly blocked rats had died (93% reduction in mortality, p less than 0.0001). \nAnimal models for arterial thrombolysis and prevention of reocclusion. Erythrocyte-rich versus platelet-rich thrombus. Experimental animal models for erythrocyte-rich (ER) and platelet-rich (PR) arterial thrombosis were developed in dogs and rabbits and used for the evaluation of the effect of antithrombin and antiplatelet agents on thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activators (rt-PA). The canine models consist of a whole blood clot produced in the left anterior descending coronary artery (ER thrombus) or a 1-cm everted (inside-out) segment graft in the circumflex coronary artery that predisposes to occlusion with PR material (PR thrombus). The rabbit models consist of a femoral arterial whole blood clot (ER thrombus) or a femoral arterial eversion graft (PR thrombus). The whole blood clot models are sensitive to recanalization with rt-PA but are consistently associated with reocclusion, notwithstanding the concomitant use of heparin and/or aspirin. Clot lysis is accelerated and reocclusion is prevented by the administration of F(ab')2 fragments of a monoclonal antibody 7E3 directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor; of Argatroban, a synthetic thrombin inhibitor; or of kistrin, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-blocking polypeptide from the Malayan pit viper venom. The PR thrombus models are very resistant to recanalization with rt-PA, but this resistance can be overcome by the concomitant use of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-blocking antibody. Thus, selective platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are more effective than aspirin, heparin, or both in accelerating arterial thrombolysis with rt-PA; in preventing reocclusion after clot lysis; and in overcoming the resistance of PR thrombus to dispersion with rt-PA. These experimental animal models may be useful in the development of improved thrombolytic strategies using plasminogen activators in conjunction with specifically targeted antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents. \nIncreasing incidence of coeliac disease in Sweden. Changes in the incidence of coelic disease was studied among children born in Goteborg, Sweden, between 1970 and 1988. A total of 188 patients with coeliac disease were found. Of these, 83% were less than 2 years old at the time of their first duodenal biopsy and 74% of them have so far been verified according to the criteria of the European Society for Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN). The cumulative incidence at 2 years of age/1000 liveborn infants increased significantly from 0.31 in the first birth cohort to 2.93 in the last. This increase could only partly be explained by improvements in detection. Weight for age at diagnosis was generally considerably below the reference value, but was slightly less affected towards the end of the period. The increase in incidence of coeliac disease is the first reported since the middle 1970s and makes the disease one of the most common chronic diseases among Swedish children. \nFatal theophylline poisoning with rhabdomyolysis. A potential role for dantrolene treatment. A fatal case of theophylline poisoning is described. The patient developed rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and compartment syndrome, as well as the more usual features of severe theophylline poisoning. Dantrolene appeared to be useful in controlling the hypermetabolic state associated with the overdose and may have a role in future treatment. \nUnusual cause of intranasal injury. Intranasal injury without external involvement is not common. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of such an injury, caused by an assailant's two fingers forced up the nostrils of our patient causing severe mucosal laceration and excessive bleeding. The patient died two weeks later. \nDelayed cardiac rupture due to blunt chest trauma. A 7-year-old boy fell from a 2.5-m height and suffered contusion of the thorax with hematoma in the soft tissues of the lateral chest wall. The rib cage itself remained intact. After 3 days, there was only local pressure sensitivity of the left hemithorax. On day 8 after the trauma, the child, who up to then had seemed to be in good health, suddenly died during lessons at school. Autopsy revealed a full-thickness rupture of the left ventricle with resultant cardiac tamponade. The macroscopic and histopathologic findings are presented and discussed. \nMechanism of the enhanced epidermal growth factor-induced growth response of genetically hypertensive vascular myocytes. Although enhanced growth of the vascular myocyte is believed to play a role in hypertensive cardiovascular disease, the cellular basis of altered growth regulation is not completely understood. The present study demonstrates that in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, the logarithmic growth rate of cultured mesenteric artery myocytes of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is similar to that of the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rat. However, in the presence of low levels of fetal calf serum, SHR myocytes respond to epidermal growth factor (EGF) with increased growth, whereas WKY cells do not. This difference does not result from different numbers or affinities of EGF receptors in these cell lines. Examination of EGF-induced growth responses of SHR and WKY myocytes in the presence of varying levels of insulin or fetal calf serum indicates that, compared with WKY myocytes, SHR myocytes have a lower requirement for factors that confer competence to respond to EGF. Another property of the SHR myocytes is an elevation of free intracellular Ca2+. To determine whether a difference in cellular Ca2+ metabolism might play a role in the differential growth response, growth of myocytes in medium containing 0.25, 0.75, or 1.25 mM extracellular Ca2+ and 5% fetal calf serum was examined. Myocytes of SHR showed enhanced growth in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum at all levels of extracellular Ca2+. It is concluded that, although vascular myocytes of SHR and WKY rats have the capacity to grow at similar rates, under limiting conditions, the SHR myocyte growth response is enhanced. \nNursery Neurobiologic Risk Score: important factor in predicting outcome in very low birth weight infants. We developed a nursery Neurobiologic Risk Score (NBRS) based on potential mechanisms of brain cell injury in preterm infants and correlated it with developmental outcome at the corrected ages of 6, 15, and 24 months. The NBRS was determined at 2 weeks of age and at the time of discharge from intensive care in 58 preterm infants with birth weights less than or equal to 1500 gm. The NBRS correlated significantly with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Mental Development Index (MDI) (r = -0.61 to -0.40) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) (r = -0.59 to -0.46), and with abnormal neurologic examination findings (r = 0.59 to 0.73) at the three testing periods. Although 12 of the 13 items composing the NBRS individually correlated with one or more outcome variables, seven items (infection, blood pH, seizures, intraventricular hemorrhage, assisted ventilation, periventricular leukomalacia, and hypoglycemia) accounted for almost all of the explained variance. Logistic regression of individual items demonstrated intraventricular hemorrhage to be the most important item for predicting the MDI at 24 months; pH was the most influential item for predicting the PDI at every testing period. A shorter, revised NBRS that included only the seven significant items demonstrated as strong a correlation with developmental outcome as the original NBRS. A revised 2-week score of greater than or equal to 5 or a discharge score of greater than or equal to 6 demonstrated 100% specificity and had a 100% positive predictive value for an abnormal outcome at 24 months of age in this group of infants. We conclude that the NBRS identifies during the intensive care nursery stay those infants at highest risk for an abnormal outcome related to nursery events. In addition, analysis of NBRS items provides insight into the relative importance of individual factors for influencing mental, motor, and neurologic outcome. \nThe role of corticosteroids in infants and children with bacterial meningitis. Bacterial meningitis continues to be a cause of substantial morbidity in infants and children. Hearing impairment is the most common sequela of this disease. Corticosteroids have been used in an attempt to reduce the incidence of meningitis-induced hearing loss. Some studies have demonstrated a decrease in the incidence of hearing impairment in patients treated with cefuroxime plus dexamethasone compared with cefuroxime alone. Similar data are lacking for other frequently used antibiotics. Based on these studies, the use of dexamethasone should be considered in infants and children greater than two months of age with suspected bacterial meningitis. Critical issues including the timing of steroid initiation in relation to antibiotic therapy and the appropriate antibiotic-corticosteroid regimen must be addressed. Studies should be performed to define the exact role of corticosteroids in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Until additional data are available, we recommend the use of dexamethasone in pediatric patients older than two months of age with bacterial meningitis. \nSelection bias in the use of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The SAVE Investigators. OBJECTIVE. To determine whether clinical selection for thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction results in a skewed population for subsequent adverse cardiovascular events. DESIGN. A comparison of the clinical features of the patients in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Study who either had or had not received thrombolytic therapy was conducted in both univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. SETTING. Hospitalized patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction from 112 broadly representative, private, academic, and government hospitals in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS. All patients in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Study had had a recent myocardial infarction (less than 16 days) and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less. INTERVENTION. Thrombolytic therapy was administered to 733 patients and was not given to 1498. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. The comparisons with respect to use of thrombolytic therapy were formulated after the completion of enrollment and indicated that the majority of patients did not receive thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS. The 1498 (67.1%) patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy were at higher risk (older age, lower functional capacity, greater likelihood of a history of prior myocardial infarction, angina, diabetes, and hypertension) for subsequent cardiovascular events and, as anticipated, were more likely to have concomitant gastrointestinal and neurological diseases. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that older age, prior myocardial infarction, impaired functional status, employment status, diabetes, and neurological diseases were predictors of use of thrombolytic therapy. CONCLUSION. Although the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Study population was selected for left ventricular dysfunction, the majority of patients who currently are judged clinically as unsuitable for thrombolytic therapy have a higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events. \nSCID mice: a suitable model for experimental studies of urologic malignancies. In vivo studies on human malignant tumors are limited because of a lack of suitable animal models. In this study, the usefulness of SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice, deficient in functions of both T- and B-lymphocytes, was evaluated. Inbred SCID mice were kept in isolated cages and 2 x 10(7) cells of KU-7, an established bladder carcinoma cell line, were inoculated in the subcutaneous tissue of the flank region of six SCID mice. Athymic nude mice were inoculated by the same method and served as the controls. The KU-7 cells were taken within 14 days in the injected region in all six SCID mice, while in only five out of eight nude mice. Tumors subsequently formed at the site of inoculation in these mice were confirmed to be transitional cell carcinomas histologically and intra-abdominal metastases were noted in two SCID mice. We conclude that SCID mice provide an ideal in vivo model for experimental studies of human urologic malignant tumors. \nBilateral anterior cerebral artery infarction resulting from explosion-type injury to the head and neck. A 43-year-old woman suffered a blast-type injury to the head and neck. She subsequently developed bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion and bilateral anterior cerebral artery infarction not demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging scan 24 hours after the explosion, but confirmed by a second scan 8 days after the explosion. In patients with blast-type injury to the head and neck who develop coma with a nonfocal neurological exam, the possibility of bilateral carotid artery occlusion and bilateral ischemic infarction should be considered. \nSynthesis of chondrocytic keratan sulphate-containing proteoglycans by human chondrosarcoma cells in long-term cell culture [published erratum appears in J Bone Joint Surg [Am] 1991 Sep;73(8):1274] Keratan sulphate is an integral component of the large aggregating proteoglycans of mature human articular cartilage. The keratan sulphate content of chondrocytic proteoglycans increases during maturation, and it is a useful marker of mature-type chondrocytic proteoglycans. Ordinarily, in cell culture, chondrocytes from non-neoplastic tissues dedifferentiate, diminish or cease to synthesize aggregating proteoglycans with the same amount of keratan sulphate as those formed in vivo, and do not maintain their in vivo phenotype. In tissue culture, this down-regulation of synthesis of keratan sulphate is irreversible. The study of the metabolism of mature human chondrocytes has been hampered by the absence of stable models. We report a cell-line, 105KC, derived from a human chondrosarcoma, that has maintained a stable proteoglycan phenotype during more than three years of culture. Analysis with immunofluorescence suggested that 105KC cells continued to synthesize keratan sulphate in long-term culture. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that 105KC cells maintained the production of chondrocytic large-aggregating proteoglycans and that keratan sulphate composed 13 per cent of their glycosaminoglycan content. To our knowledge, 105KC represents the first model to have maintained the post-fetal chondrocytic proteoglycan phenotype in stable culture. This study documents the feasibility of the development of mature chondrocytic cell-lines and sheds light on the biological characteristics of chondrosarcomas. \nDoppler and echocardiographic characteristics of patients having an Austin Flint murmur. BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genesis of the Austin Flint murmur using Doppler and echocardiographic imaging. METHODS AND RESULTS. A total of 51 patients having significant aortic insufficiency and an anatomically normal mitral valve were evaluated. They were divided into two groups; 30 patients had an audible Austin Flint murmur (AFM+) and 21 did not (AFM-). All patients had a complete M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic examination to characterize left ventricular size and function, motion of the mitral valve, transmitral flow velocities, direction of the aortic insufficiency jet, and severity of aortic insufficiency. There was no significant difference in severity of aortic insufficiency between groups. There was, however, a significant difference in direction of the insufficiency jet. In the AFM+ group compared with the AFM- group, for the parasternal long-axis view 24 (80%) versus eight (38%) had their insufficiency jet directed at the mitral valve, for the apical five-chamber view the values were 25 (83%) versus five (24%), and for the apical long-axis view the values were 27 (90%) versus five (24%); for all comparisons p less than 0.01. There was also a greater frequency of localized anterior mitral leaflet distortion by two-dimensional echocardiography (AFM+:23 [77%] versus AFM-:five [24%]; p less than 0.001) and a greater frequency of Doppler striations overlying the aortic insufficiency jet (AFM+:25 [83%] versus AFM-:seven [33%]; p less than 0.001). Regarding transmitral flow velocities, there was no significant difference in filling patterns or absolute velocities during early or late diastole between groups. There was no gradient by Doppler analysis or by hemodynamics (n = 26) across the mitral valve in either group. There also was no difference in the frequency of preclosure of the mitral valve (AFM+:two versus AFM-:three). Systolic function was similar in both groups, but the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was significantly greater in the AFM+ group (6.8 +/- 0.8 cm) than in the AFM- group (6.2 +/- 0.7 cm, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study suggest that the primary factor responsible for the Austin Flint murmur is the presence of an aortic insufficiency jet directed at the anterior mitral leaflet. This, combined with the biphasic pattern of transmitral flow, distorts the shape of the anterior mitral leaflet as it opens and closes during diastole, making it shudder. The leaflet's shuddering sets up vibrations and shock waves that distort the aortic insufficiency jet, causing the observed Doppler striations and probably the sound of the murmur. There is no evidence from this study to support prior theories that have proposed functional mitral stenosis or diastolic mitral regurgitation as the source of the murmur. \nAcoustic discrimination of three types of infant cries. The ability of acoustic characteristics, both separately and in linear combination with others, to differentiate among procedural pain-induced, hungry, and fussy crying was explored using audiorecordings of cries from healthy 2 to 4-month-old infants. Fussy cries were less tense than hungry or pain-induced cries and pain-induced cries had significantly stronger second formant amplitudes than fussy or hungry cries. Formants and tenseness were important contributors to a linear combination of acoustic measures, derived from discriminant function analysis, which correctly classified 74% of the procedural pain-induced crying specimens. The inability of this linear combination of acoustic measures to identify correctly approximately one-third of the cry specimens suggests that the discrete acoustic differences among the three situationally defined types of crying is not large. \nHemorrhage and intracranial hypertension in combination increase cerebral production of thromboxane A2. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: To determine the effects of reduced cerebral perfusion pressures produced by hemorrhage alone or in combination with intracranial hypertension on thromboxane A2 (TxA2) production, we undertook a randomized study in 38 anesthetized, mongrel dogs. Animals were subjected to 30 mins of hemorrhagic shock with normal (group 1) or increased (group 2) intracranial pressure (ICP). Group 1 animals (n = 22) were hemorrhaged to reduce cerebral perfusion pressure to 40 mm Hg for 30 mins. In group 2 (n = 16), cerebral perfusion pressure was reduced by the combination of less severe hypotension and intracranial hypertension (20 mm Hg). Cerebral and systemic hemodynamic measurements were recorded, including cerebral blood flow (sagittal sinus outflow method); ICP; cerebral perfusion pressure; and arterial and cerebral venous concentrations of TxB2 (double-antibody radioimmunoassay technique), the major metabolite of TxA2. Data were obtained at baseline and at the beginning and end of the 30-min shock period. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic shock significantly (p less than .05) decreased cerebral blood flow in both groups. At the beginning of the shock period, cerebral blood flow was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p less than .05) and venous-arterial differences in TxB2 increased significantly (p less than .05) in group 2, but not in group 1. At the end of the 30-min shock period, venous-arterial levels of TxB2 remained significantly (p less than .05) higher in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Increased cerebral production of TxA2 during hypotension accompanied by intracranial hypertension may contribute to the severity of neural damage produced by the combination of head trauma and shock. \nMorphine-augmented cholescintigraphy: its efficacy in detecting acute cholecystitis Cholescintigrams were performed in 158 patients suspected of having acute cholecystitis after administration of 185 Mbq (5 mCi) of 99mTc-mebrofenin or disofenin. Morphine sulfate, 0.04 mg/kg was given intravenously if there was nonvisualization of the gallbladder at 40-60 min provided that radiotracer was seen within the small bowel. Acute cholecystitis was deemed present if there was nonvisualization of the gallbladder 30 min post-morphine administration; no cystic duct obstruction was present if the gallbladder was demonstrated pre- or post-morphine administration. A final diagnosis was estimated in 51 postoperative patients histologically, the remainder having their final diagnosis gleaned from their medical records. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of morphine-augmented cholescintigraphy in detecting acute cholecystitis was 94.6, 99.1, 97.2, and 98.3%, respectively. These findings indicate that morphine-augmented cholescintigraphy detects acute cholecystitis with as high a degree of accuracy as conventional hepatobiliary scintigraphy, yet requires only 1.5 hr to establish the diagnosis. \nThe sleep apnoea syndrome in obesity: risk of sudden death. A total of 34 severely obese men with a history of heavy snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness indicative of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) were studied prospectively. Their mean age was 46 years, and mean body mass index was 41.6 kg m-2. During a 4-year follow-up, 15% (5/34) of these subjects died (three cases of acute myocardial infarction and two cases of pulmonary oedema), all of them suddenly and unexpectedly, outside hospital. On autopsy the degree of atherosclerosis was found to be moderate in all cases. In 68% (15/22) of the men a pathological apnoea index (mean value 46 +/- 20) confirmed the OSAS diagnosis. Exercise tests and neurological examinations did not reveal any other causes of daytime sleepiness. Mean blood pressure at rest and during exercise was normal, and mean serum lipid and blood glucose levels were normal. Spirometry revealed intrapulmonary restrictive changes that could not be attributed to the heavy thoracic wall. Compliance was reduced to about 50% of reference values, and the mean pCO2 level (5.8 kPa) was close to the upper reference limit. Blood tests suggested that high alcohol consumption may be an important factor contributing to OSAS. These results demonstrate that morbidly obese men with a history of OSAS have a high risk of sudden cardiovascular death, despite the absence of other conventional risk factors. \nPathologic changes associated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Prostate glands exposed to androgen deprivation with leuprolide +/- flutamide were evaluated for pathologic changes which might be related to therapy. Comparing pretreatment and posttreatment tissue by visual discrimination using light microscopic study revealed treatment-related alterations in the size and distribution of neoplastic glands in 60% of cases. Quantitative measurements documented glandular changes in an even greater percentage of cases. Although distinctive, the histologic pattern was not specific for leuprolide/flutamide. The absence of appreciable degeneration and necrosis in tumor cells suggests that this type of androgen deprivation may act through suppression rather than ablation of prostatic cancers. The relationship between treatment-related histologic effects and initial tumor grade and clinical stage as well as expression of prostate-specific antigen was studied. Accurate histologic assessment of leuprolide/flutamide-treated prostate glands should not be a problem so long as specimens are thoroughly examined and drug-related variations in tumor morphologic features are appreciated. \nDefective Fc receptor-mediated clearance in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Fc receptor-mediated clearance of immunoglobulin G-coated autologous erythrocytes was studied in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 14), alcoholic liver cirrhosis (n = 5) and healthy reference individuals (n = 14). The mean half-life of the sensitized erythrocytes was significantly prolonged in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (85 +/- 25 minutes; P less than 0.001) compared with the corresponding value in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (16 +/- 2 minutes) and healthy reference individuals (20 +/- 5 minutes), respectively. No correlation between clearance rate and age, liver histopathology, or serum levels of bilirubin, aminotransferases, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin A, and Clq binding or C3-containing immune complexes was found. The results presented here indicate a profound disturbance of Fc receptor-mediated immune clearance function in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. \nCompetitive control of myosin expression: hypertrophy vs. hyperthyroidism. The competition between two opposing influences on the phenotypic expression of skeletal muscle myosin were studied to determine which was the dominant regulator. Experimental hyperthyroidism, which induces fast myosin expression, was produced by subcutaneous implantation of a 40-day constant-time-release triiodothyronine pellet. Compensatory hypertrophy, which induces slow myosin expression, was produced by surgical removal of a synergistic hindlimb muscle. Hyperthyroidism increased the percentage of type II fibers and the fast myosin isoforms in both the plantaris and soleus muscles. Hypertrophy significantly increased the percentage of type I fibers and the slow myosin type in the plantaris and soleus muscles. However, with the simultaneous introduction of hyperthyroidism and hypertrophy, only the hyperthyroid effects were observed. Hyperthyroidism and not physiological demand was found to be the dominant regulator of skeletal muscle myosin expression. \nThe double-stapled ileal reservoir and ileoanal anastomosis. A prospective review of sphincter function and clinical outcome. Fifteen consecutive patients (nine males and six females) who underwent construction of a double-stapled ileoanal reservoir (DS-IAR) were prospectively evaluated. Mean and maximal resting pressures preoperatively, before ileostomy closure, and at 12 months, were 53 and 84 mm Hg, 39 and 62 mm Hg, and 62 and 81 mm Hg. Mean and maximal squeeze pressures at those same time periods were 96 and 153 mm Hg, 111 and 173 mm Hg, and 95 and 168 mm Hg. There were no significant decreases in either resting or squeeze pressure between preoperative values and those obtained 12 months after surgery. However, the length of the high pressure zone decreased from 3.8 cm preoperatively to 2.3 cm at 12 months. This reflects the sacrifice of the cephalad 1.5 cm of the internal anal sphincter necessary to effect this anastomosis at a mean of 1.4 cm from the dentate line. However, this maneuver did not result in poor continence. Eleven patients whose ileostomies were closed for a mean of 9 months, ranging from 3 to 15 months, were evaluated regarding functional outcome. Only one patient had any incontinence and this patient had incomplete circular-stapled tissue rings, which necessitated transanal suture repair of the anastomotic defect. Similarly, three of the four patients who sometimes or rarely use a pad at night had transanal-suture reinforcement. Ten of the 11 patients never wear a pad during the day. No pelvic or perianal sepsis occurred. Stratified squamous epithelium was found in 6 of the 13 distal stapler \"donuts\" that were examined. In addition, 10 patients underwent biopsy of the tissue immediately caudad to the circular staple line at the time of ileostomy closure; in five, only stratified squamous epithelium was noted. The DS-IAR is associated with excellent objective physiologic and subjective functional results. \nEffect of ketanserin on intraoperative blood loss during total hip arthroplasty in elderly patients under general anaesthesia. We have studied the effect of ketanserin, a selective serotonin S2-receptor antagonist, on surgical bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in elderly patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. One group of patients (n = 9) received ketanserin 10 mg i.v. followed by an infusion of 0.075 mg kg-1 h-1. The second group (n = 8) received placebo. Both groups were comparable with regard to age, height and body weight. Mean intraoperative blood loss was 454 ml with ketanserin and 894 ml with placebo (P = 0.004; Wilcoxon two-sample test). Mean duration of the operation was less with ketanserin (112 min) than with placebo (134 min) (P = 0.004), but rate of blood loss was also less with ketanserin (4.1 vs 6.7 ml min-1; P = 0.03). In the ketanserin group, mean arterial pressures tended to be less than in the placebo group. Reductions in central venous pressure were similar in both groups. There were no complications in relation to the use of ketanserin. \nClinical follow-up and immunogenetic studies of 32 patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome 31 patients with L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) that developed during the United States outbreak in 1989 were followed up prospectively at a university hospital outpatient rheumatology clinic for 16 to 24 months from the onset of their illness. Another patient with EMS associated with L-tryptophan in 1988 was followed up for 30 months. 93% of the 28 survivors from the 1989 cohort continue to have symptoms affecting 1-4 organ systems (median 3) and 3 have died, so the disorder produces considerable morbidity and mortality. The chronic sequelae most often associated with long-term disability are sclerodermatous skin thickening (54%), sensorimotor polyneuropathy (61%), proximal myopathy (36%), and severe episodic myalgias (64%). Thrombocytopenia developed in 1 patient. HLA-class II typing revealed a non-significant trend towards an association with HLA-DR4. Early therapy with corticosteroids did not seem to prevent the development of chronic manifestations. \nGrowth hormone treatment of growth failure secondary to total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. Growth hormone was given to 13 children (nine boys, four girls) with acute leukaemia who had undergone treatment with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation before bone marrow transplantation. Mean age at total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation was 9.0 years (range 3.7-15.8). Endocrinological investigation was carried out at a mean of 2.0 years (range 0.4-4.0) after bone marrow transplantation. Peak serum growth hormone responses to hypoglycaemia were less than 10.0 micrograms/l (less than 20.0 mU/l) in 10, 10.5 micrograms/l (21.0 mU/l) in one, greater than 16.0 micrograms/l (greater than 32.0 mU/l) in two patients. Mean age of the patients at the start of growth hormone treatment was 12.2 years (range 5.8-18.2). The mean time between total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation and the start of growth hormone treatment was 3.2 years (range, 1.1-5.0). Height velocity SD score (SD) increased from a mean pretreatment value of -1.27 (0.65) to + 0.22 (0.81) in the first year, +0.16 (1.11) in the second year, and +0.42 (0.71) in the third year of treatment. Height SD score (SD) changed only slightly from -1.52 (0.42) to -1.50 (0.47) in the first year, to -1.50 (0.46) in the second year, and -1.74 (0.92) in the third year. Measurement of segmental proportions showed no significant increase in subischial leg length from -0.87 (0.67) to -0.63 (0.65) in the first year, to -0.58 (0.70) in the second year, and -0.80 (1.14) in the third year of treatment. \nSympathetically maintained pain of the digits in porphyria cutanea tarda relieved by i.v. regional guanethidine. A case of a sympathetically maintained pain of the tips of the fingers in a 39-year-old man with porphyria cutanea tarda is presented. Occupational vibrating trauma is the presumed cause. The successful treatment with intravenous regional guanethidine is reported. \nCoronary heart disease in rhesus monkeys with diet-induced coronary artery atherosclerosis. Diet-induced coronary artery atherosclerosis develops in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). The goal of this study was to establish the rhesus monkey as an animal model of coronary heart disease (CHD). From a colony of 160 rhesus monkeys fed an atherogenic diet, we identified 14 monkeys with electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evidence of CHD. When compared with 14 rhesus monkeys matched for age, gender, and dietary history with normal electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, monkeys with CHD had higher arterial blood pressures (mean +/- SEM, 92 +/- 4 mm Hg vs 75 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively), lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 1.70 +/- 0.25 mmol/L vs 2.32 +/- 0.28 mmol/L [66 +/- 10 mg/dL vs 90 +/- 11 mg/dl]), and lower A-l apolipoprotein concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 200 +/- 17 mg/dL vs 252 +/- 15 mg/dL). Monkeys with CHD tended to have higher total plasma cholesterol concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 11.6 +/- 1.55 mmol/L vs 9.36 +/- 0.93 mmol/L [450 +/- 60 mg/dL vs 362 +/- 36 mg/dL]) and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 8.71 +/- 1.75 mmol/L vs 6.12 +/- 0.90 mmol/L [337 +/- 68 mg/dL vs 237 +/- 35 mg/dl]) than monkeys with normal electrocardiograms and echocardiograms. We conclude that rhesus monkeys, like human beings, develop CHD as a complication of coronary artery atherosclerosis. Furthermore, risk factors for CHD in rhesus monkeys and human beings are similar. \nPrimary chest wall tumor appearing as frozen shoulder. Review and case presentations. The term frozen shoulder may apply to a primary, common, recognizable entity with a predictable course to a painful stiff condition with periarthritis secondary to trauma, rotator cuff or arthritic source. We studied 140 cases of frozen shoulder, referred to a surgical clinic for manipulation when conservative care was not effective. Investigations showed only 40 cases had \"primary\" frozen shoulder and among these were 3 patients with a local primary invasive neoplasm mimicking the exact features of the common condition. The attending physician and surgeon should be suspicious of tumor in younger patients with progressive pain among the other features of primary frozen shoulder. \nAcute cor pulmonale secondary to metastatic tumor to the heart: a case report and literature review. Metastatic tumors to the heart are becoming more common due to improved survival afforded by advanced treatment of malignancies. Their presence should be sought in a cancer patient who develops new primary cardiac symptoms. We present a case of a 50-year-old woman who succumbed to acute cor pulmonale secondary to metastatic laryngeal carcinoma to the right ventricle with subsequent tumor emboli to the pulmonary vasculature. \nImpaired suppression of plasma norepinephrine during head-down tilt in patients with congestive heart failure. Neurohumoral activation is present in congestive heart failure and may contribute to vasoconstriction in this syndrome. The mechanisms leading to and maintaining neurohumoral activation in long-standing congestive heart failure are as yet undefined. The present study addresses the possibility that baroreceptor-mediated suppression of plasma norepinephrine may be abnormal in patients with long-standing congestive heart failure. Eight normal subjects and 12 patients with long-standing congestive heart failure were studied during 15 minutes of 30 degrees head-down tilt. There were no significant changes in heart rate or arterial blood pressure in either group during these maneuvers. In normal subjects, plasma norepinephrine declined from 257 +/- 38 pg/ml at control to 208 +/- 39 pg/ml during head-down tilt (p less than 0.005). Plasma norepinephrine was elevated in the patients with congestive heart failure, 475 +/- 189 pg/ml, and did not change during head-down tilt. These observations suggest that baroreflex loading maneuvers, which in this study included increased central blood volume and hydrostatic effects on the sinoaortic baroreceptor, do not suppress increased plasma norepinephrine in patients with long-standing congestive heart failure. Impaired baroreflex responsiveness could therefore contribute to either the generation or maintenance of high plasma norepinephrine in this syndrome. \nAprotinin reduces intraoperative and postoperative blood loss in membrane oxygenator cardiopulmonary bypass. To determine whether aprotinin can provide a significant improvement of hemostasis in cardiopulmonary bypass using a membrane oxygenator, we tested this drug in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The subjects were 80 male patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery bypass grafting. Forty patients received aprotinin and 40 patients served as placebo controls. Aprotinin (4 x 10(6) KIU) was given as a continuous infusion, starting before operation and continuing until after cardiopulmonary bypass; additionally, 2 x 10(6) KIU aprotinin was added to the pump prime. Intraoperative and postoperative bleeding, respectively two thirds and one third of the total perioperative blood loss, were both significantly reduced in the aprotinin-treated group (p less than 0.01). The total average perioperative blood loss, corrected to a hemoglobin concentration of 7 mmol/L, was 550 mL in the aprotinin-treated patients versus 900 mL in the control patients. This reduction in blood loss, furthermore, significantly decreased the amount of postoperative blood transfusions (p less than 0.05) and increased the percentage of patients who did not receive postoperative donor blood from 42% to 68%. Aprotinin increased the activated clotting time significantly during cardiopulmonary bypass, which led to a reduction in heparin usage. The improved hemostasis during operation, despite the prolonged activated clotting time, might even abolish the need for heparin conversion with protamine at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, thus allowing retransfusion through cardiotomy suction to be continued, which saves the blood that is currently lost with vacuum suction. \nQuality assurance for patients with head injuries admitted to a regional trauma unit. The efficacy of trauma systems in reducing preventable deaths has been established but the methods of auditing care are still evolving. Various \"audit filters\" to identify which patients' charts should be reviewed have been proposed. An analysis of all patients admitted to the Regional Trauma Unit (RTU) over a 19-month period was conducted. Of 729 patients, 135 were identified as having suffered a traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (TICH). On review, neither delay in transfer from the emergency room to the operating room nor increasing time from the incident to the operating room correlated with increasing mortality. In contrast to delay, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission correlated well with outcome. The charts of patients with anomalous outcomes based on admission GCS score were reviewed, and two possibly preventable deaths were identified. There were 48 patients with TICH who had no operations but there were no deaths attributable to a missed operation. There were 76 patients for whom the GCS score at the referring hospital and the GCS score on admission to the RTU were available. Seven of 19 patients who worsened on transfer declined because of significant pulmonary injuries. Anomalous outcomes based on admission GCS score and declining GCS scores are recommended as quality assurance filters. \nProtein kinase C plays a role in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of lymphoid microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase. Evidence for a CD3-associated cascade that includes pp56lck and that is defective in HPB-ALL. Ligation of the CD3 receptor induces multiple signal transduction events that modify the activation state of the T cell. We have compared two lines that express biologically active CD3 receptors but differ in their biochemical activation pathways during ligation of this receptor. Jurkat cells respond to anti-CD3 with Ca2+ mobilization, PKC activation, induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of newly characterized lymphoid microtubule associated protein-2 kinase (MAP-2K). MAP-2K itself is a 43-kDa phosphoprotein that requires tyrosine phosphorylation for activation. Although ligation of the CD3 receptor in HPB-ALL could stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of a 59- kDa substrate, there was no associated induction of [Ca2+]i flux, PKC, or MAP-2K activation. A specific PKC agonist, PMA, which bypasses the CD3 receptor, could, however, activate MAP-2K in HPB-ALL cells. This implies that defective stimulation of PKC by the CD3 receptor is responsible for its failure to activate MAP-2K in HPB-ALL. The defect in PKC activation is likely distal to the CD3 receptor as A1F14- failed to activate MAP-2K in HPB-ALL but was effective in Jurkat cells. The stimulatory effect of PMA on MAP-2K activity in HPB-ALL was accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of this kinase which implies that PKC may, in some way, regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP-2K. A candidate for this role is pp56lck which underwent posttranslational modification (seen as mobility change on SDS-PAGE) during anti-CD3 and PMA stimulation in Jurkat or PMA treatment in HPB-ALL. There was, in fact, exact coincidence between induction of PKC activity, posttranslational modification of lck and tyrosine phosphorylation/activation of MAP-2K. Lck kinase activity in an immune complex kinase assay was unchanged during PMA treatment. An alternative explanation is that modification of lck may alter its substrate profile. We therefore looked at the previously documented ability of PKC to dissociate lck from the CD4 receptor and found that PMA could reduce the stoichiometry of the lck interaction with CD4 in HPB-ALL and to a lesser extent in Jurkat cells. These results imply the existence of a kinase cascade that is initiated by PKC and, in the course of which, lck and MAP-2K may interact. \nTerminal axon pathology in infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. In order to clarify the pathogenesis of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, ultrastructural studies of the terminal and nonterminal axons of motor and autonomic nerves in muscle and skin, of which structures are much simpler than those of the central nervous system, were performed in 5 patients affected by infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. The primary lesion was located in the axon terminal; the majority of terminal axons were dystrophic with tubulo-membranous profiles, while there were only a few dystrophic axons in the nonterminal axons. According to these findings, it is logical to consider that interruption of axonal transport at the site of the \"turnaround\" process is a cause of dystrophic change of the terminal axon in infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. \nSmall bowel length in Crohn's disease. The length of the small intestine in patients with Crohn's disease who are referred for surgery has not been well studied. In this report, 25 patients with Crohn's disease who were being operated on for the first time had their small intestine measured at the time of surgery. The mean length of small intestine in this group was 501 cm, which was not different from a group of patients without Crohn's disease who were being operated on for other problems. In the group of patients with Crohn's disease, as well as the entire group, there was a correlation between increasing height and longer small bowel length. No other parameters investigated, including weight, surface area, age, sex, and duration of disease, correlated with bowel length. The results of this study are somewhat encouraging to pat",
