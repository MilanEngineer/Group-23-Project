        "text": "ssels was tested using light microscopy and computer-assisted morphometry in rat sciatic nerve. Experimental nerves were exposed to a concentration of 10% procaine HCl, which from previous studies has been demonstrated to routinely produce an edematous neuropathy. For each vessel, a \"constriction ratio\" was defined by dividing its minimum intraperineurial lumen area by the average for minimum endoneurial and epineurial lumen cross-sectional areas. Constriction ratios were 0.91 +/- 0.26 (mean +/- SD) for control vessels and 0.28 +/- 0.25 for vessels in the procaine group (p less than 0.005). In addition, a strong negative correlation was observed between the morphologic demonstration of nerve edema and the transperineurial vessel constriction ratio (r = -0.85; p less than 0.002). It is concluded that in neuropathies characterized by widespread edema and increased endoneurial fluid pressures, the concomitant constriction of transperineurial vessels could diminish nerve blood flow and facilitate nerve injury. \nSuccessful long-term control of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome with etoposide. A 38-year-old man with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome had an inadequate response to steroids and severe side effects from hydroxyurea treatment, which necessitated withdrawal of the treatment. Successful control of clinical symptoms and eosinophil counts was obtained with etoposide (VP16-213) for 18 months. VP16-213 may be valuable in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome treatment. \nPediatric heart transplantation at Stanford: results of a 15-year experience. The long-term results of pediatric heart transplantation were evaluated in 53 patients, aged 0.25 to 18.94 years, who received transplants at Stanford University Medical Center between 1974 and 1989. Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (68%), congenital heart disease (21%), endocardial fibroelastosis (8%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (3%). Immunosuppression was achieved with combinations of cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine. Thirty-seven of 42 recipients leaving the hospital after transplantation were alive and in New York Heart Association class I at study's end. Cumulative survival was 79% at 1 year, 76% at 3 years, and 69% at 5 years. Fourteen recipients have survived more than 5 years (5.1 to 12.4 years). Hospital readmission for illness has been infrequent, decreasing from 6.8 days to 0.9 days per year over 5 years. Eleven patients have required no rehospitalization. Posttransplant deaths were due to infection (19%), rejection (4%), pulmonary hypertension (4%), coronary artery disease (2%), and lymphoproliferative disease (2%). Retransplantation was required for intractable rejection in 4 patients and advanced coronary artery disease in 2. Hypertension and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were common in individuals receiving cyclosporine. Growth was often impaired in prepubertal children receiving daily prednisone. Based on this 15-year experience, it is concluded that heart transplantation represents a reasonable alternative for selected young patients with end-stage cardiac disease. \nThe noncemented porous-coated hip prosthesis. A three-year clinical follow-up study and roentgenographic analysis. This was a retrospective study reviewing 68 hip arthroplasties performed with noncemented, porous-coated components at three institutions in the period between December 1983 and June 1987. Fifty of these were available for follow-up study. The mean follow-up period was three years (range, 18-56 months). Thirty-seven patients were treated by total hip arthroplasty (THA) with porous-coated components, and thirteen were implanted with porous-coated femoral stems with bipolar endoprostheses using a porous-coated femoral stem and a universal head. The mean Harris hip score at follow-up evaluation for the entire group was 85.7 points. Eighty percent of the patients had either a good or excellent result. Those patients implanted with a porous femoral stem with bipolar acetabular components had only 54% good or excellent results compared with 90% good or excellent results for those having THA. Roentgenographic findings included a 59% rate of femoral neck cortex osteopenia, an 80% rate of medial or lateral distal cortical hypertrophy, and an 80% rate of distal bone bridging. All of these roentgenographic changes were secondary to changes in stress transference to the proximal femur. There was no correlation between thigh pain or the degree of bone-prosthesis radiolucencies and the fit of the femoral stem. \nGeneral moderate hypothermia in the surgical treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. The diagnosis and surgical treatment of aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta is difficult and some aspects of management remain controversial. We report 53 patients treated in the period 1983-1988; 25.9% of them had previously been erroneously diagnosed as having mediastinal cysts or tumours. Duplex scanning and computerised tomography were valuable adjuncts in establishing the correct diagnosis, which was confirmed by aortography in 52 patients. Of 49 patients operated upon electively three died with a mortality rate of 6.1%; of the 4 patients operated upon as emergencies 2 died. Fifty patients survived the operative procedure and of the 3 operated upon under normothermia 1 developed paraplegia, whereas of the 47 patients operated upon under moderate hypothermia (30 degrees-31 degrees C) only 1 developed paraplegia. \nConcentration of cefuroxime in serum and middle ear effusion after single dose treatment with cefuroxime axetil. Antimicrobial agents play an important role in the treatment of patients with acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion (OME). The study was undertaken to determine the concentrations of cefuroxime in the blood and middle ear effusions (MEE) of children between 6 and 12 years of age with acute otitis media and chronic OME after a single oral dose administration of cefuroxime axetil, the ester prodrug of cefuroxime. Cefuroxime axetil (250 mg) was administered 2 to 6 hours before either myringotomy for acute otitis media or myringotomy and tube insertion for chronic OME. Blood samples and middle ear aspirates were obtained from 31 children and the samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Cefuroxime was recovered in measurable concentrations in all serum samples and in 15 (79%) of the 19 MEE specimens analyzed. No correlation was seen between cefuroxime MEE concentrations and effusion type, bacteriology or serum concentrations. This study shows that cefuroxime does penetrate into MEE when OME is present and that therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in some patients. \nSymptom reporting in wanted and unwanted pregnancies. This study examined the association between unwanted pregnancy and the reporting of pregnancy symptoms in a sample of 99 pregnant women drawn from an urban, medical school based family practice residency. Of these women, 51 had unwanted pregnancies, and 48 had wanted pregnancies. Women with wanted pregnancies were more likely than women with unwanted pregnancies to report three pregnancy symptoms (amenorrhea, breast tenderness, and morning sickness). This association of symptoms with a wanted pregnancy persisted after controlling for age, race, marital status, contraceptive use, menstrual irregularity, and days since last menses through multiple logistic regression. Findings suggest that symptoms may be underreported by women with unwanted pregnancies. \nCurrent treatment for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: results and surgical implications. From July 1986 to January 1991, 123 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent operation for ablation of aberrant conduction pathways. There were 85 male and 38 female patients ranging in age from 11 months to 68 years. Associated anomalies included Ebstein's anomaly, sudden death syndrome, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, abdominal aortic aneurysm, neurofibromatosis, other arrhythmias, or other complex congenital heart disease. Forty-one patients had multiple accessory pathways. Operative results showed a 7% initial failure rate, which dropped to 3% after reoperation. One patient had undergone previous operation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome at another institution. Procedures performed concomitantly included mitral or tricuspid valve repair or replacement (6), right ventricular conduit replacement, subaortic resection, Fontan repair, corrected transposition repair, coronary artery bypass, and placement of an automatic internal cardioverter defibrillator. There was no operative mortality. Late follow-up is 27 +/- 16 months, and complications included mitral regurgitation and myocardial infarction. By comparison, in the last 12 months 124 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent catheter ablation using radiofrequency current. There were 9 patients with multiple pathways. One hundred twelve patients (90%) had all accessory atrioventricular connections ablated and have remained free of symptomatic tachycardia. There have been 12 failures (10%), of which 5 have had operation and 7 are being treated medically. Mean follow-up is 7 +/- 5 months, and complications included circumflex coronary artery occlusion, excessive bleeding, valve perforation, and cerebral vascular accident. \nAssessment of aortic and pulmonic stenosis by echocardiography. Doppler and imaging echocardiography are highly useful methods of identifying and quantifying both aortic and pulmonic stenosis. The presence of valve stenosis and associated regurgitation is based on detecting abnormal intracardiac velocity patterns near the affected valve. Defining the specific valve involved and the type of lesion present is based on determining the location and timing of the abnormal velocities. Both color flow imaging and duplex pulsed Doppler with two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging are highly accurate in identifying the lesions present. Quantification of the severity of stenotic lesions requires calculation of the pressure gradient across the valve and estimation of valve area; quantification of volume flow rate is frequently helpful. The pressure gradient is calculated from high velocity data acquired in the stenotic valve orifice by using the Bernoulli equation. Volume flow rate through the valve can be estimated by using Doppler velocity data and two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging data acquired at sites upstream from the stenotic valve. The continuity equation allows calculation of valve area that is based on this noninvasive stroke volume and pressure gradient data. This review characterizes flow patterns present near stenotic valves, discusses the equations required to quantify aortic and pulmonic stenosis, and then describes the clinical approach to the noninvasive quantification of both stenotic lesions. \nPearly penile papules: absence of human papillomavirus DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. Pearly penile papules clinically resemble the sexually transmitted papular variant of genital condylomata. Histologically, however, pearly penile papules consist of fibropapillomata that lack the characteristic morphologic features of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. To study the possible association of HPV infections with pearly penile papules, we examined tissue specimens from 13 men with pearly penile papules with and without associated penile condylomata. Biopsy specimens were tested for the presence of HPV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. None of the pearly penile papules contained HPV DNA sequences, whereas four of seven cases clinically suspected of being condylomata associated with pearly penile papules contained HPV DNA. These results confirm that pearly penile papule lesions do not contain HPV DNA; therefore, the distinction between pearly penile papules and penile condylomata is clinically significant. \nDecreased plasticity of glucoregulatory responses in aged rats: effects of chronic stress. These experiments were conducted to determine the effects of age and chronic stress on the ability of rats to attenuate stimulus-induced glucose and insulin responses during repeated exposure to a mild stressor. Young (5-month) and old (21-month) Fischer 344 male rats were either exposed to intermittent sessions of an escapable footshock stress for 3 months, or to no chronic stress. Afterwards, blood samples were obtained from each rat before, during, and after the first and fourth exposure to a novel motion stimulus. Between the first and the fourth exposure to the motion stimulus a pronounced attenuation of glucose and insulin responses was seen in both groups of young rats, and in old chronically stressed rats, but not in old control animals. Thus, it appears that the adverse effects of aging on plasticity of glucoregulatory response processes were significantly diminished by exposure of the animals to periodic challenges from their external environment. \nPrognostic significance of atrial fibrillation in advanced heart failure. A study of 390 patients. BACKGROUND. Atrial fibrillation is common in advanced heart failure, but its prognostic significance is controversial. METHODS AND RESULTS. We evaluated the relation of atrial rhythm to overall survival and sudden death in 390 consecutive advanced heart failure patients. Etiology of heart failure was coronary artery disease in 177 patients (45%) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease in 213 patients (55%). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.19 +/- 0.07. Seventy-five patients (19%) had paroxysmal (26 patients) or chronic (49 patients) atrial fibrillation. Compared with patients with sinus rhythm, patients with atrial fibrillation did not differ in etiology of heart failure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, or embolic events but were more likely to be receiving warfarin and antiarrhythmic drugs and had a slightly higher left ventricular ejection fraction. After a mean follow-up of 236 +/- 303 days, 98 patients died: 56 (57%) died suddenly, and 36 (37%) died of progressive heart failure. Actuarial 1-year overall survival was 68%, and sudden death-free survival was 79%. Actuarial survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (52% versus 71%, p = 0.0013). Similarly, sudden death-free survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (69% versus 82%, p = 0.0013). By Cox proportional hazards model, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation were independent risk factors for total mortality and sudden death. For patients who had pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of less than 16 mm Hg on therapy, atrial fibrillation was associated with poorer 1-year survival (44% versus 83%, p = 0.00001); however, in the high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure group, atrial fibrillation did not confer an increased risk (58% versus 57%). CONCLUSIONS. Atrial fibrillation is a marker for increased risk of death, especially in heart failure patients who have lower filling pressures on vasodilator and diuretic therapy. Whether aggressive attempts to maintain sinus rhythm will reduce this risk is unknown. \nLimitation of no reflow injury by blood-free reperfusion with oxygenated perfluorochemical (Fluosol-DA 20%). This study was designed to assess the effects of blood-free reperfusion with oxygenated or unoxygenated intracoronary perfluorochemical (Fluosol-DA 20%) on myocardial perfusion and to determine its mechanism or mechanisms of limiting no reflow. Twenty-four dogs underwent 90 min of coronary occlusion followed by 210 min of reperfusion and were randomized to either: 1) blood-free reperfusion with intracoronary oxygenated perfluorochemical (20 ml/kg per min) for 20 min followed by blood reperfusion (n = 8); 2) intracoronary unoxygenated perfluorochemical administered as in those treated with oxygenated perfluorochemical (n = 8); and 3) blood reperfusion alone (control) (n = 8). Regional myocardial blood flow was serially determined and global myocardial perfusion was assessed by an intravenous injection of the fluorescent dye (thioflavin-S). Quantitative studies were performed to determine neutrophil infiltration and extent of endothelial injury. Hemodynamic variables were similar in all groups. The zone of impaired perfusion (thioflavin negative), expressed as a percent of the left ventricle, averaged 10 +/- 2%, 6 +/- 2% and 3 +/- 1%, in control and unoxygenated and oxygenated perfluorochemical groups, respectively (control versus oxygenated perfluorochemical p less than 0.004). The reduction in thioflavin-negative area with oxygenated perfluorochemical was associated with a notable recovery of endocardial blood flow (0.97 +/- 0.22 vs. control 0.39 +/- 0.08 ml/min per g; p less than 0.04) at 210 min of reperfusion. The number of capillaries plugged by neutrophils (per 200 capillaries) in thioflavin-negative areas was similar with both oxygenated (5.9 +/- 1.4) and unoxygenated perfluorochemical (5.4 +/- 0.8) treatment and was significantly less than that with the control group (18.9 +/- 3.2, p less than 0.003). \nEstrogen and estrogen receptors in thyroid carcinomas. Thyroid tissues, composed of normal thyroid (10 cases), Graves' thyroid (4), and papillary carcinoma (10), were measured for the presence of receptors for estrogen (ER) using an enzyme-immunoassay method. The mean value of ER in papillary carcinoma tissues (4.0 +/- 3.6 fmol/mg protein) was higher than that in normal thyroid tissues (0.8 +/- 0.4 fmol/mg protein) or that in Graves' thyroids (2.6 +/- 0.9 fmol/mg protein). In 10 papillary carcinomas, 3 were from male patients and 7 were from females. The mean value of ER in the tumors from male patients (7.2 +/- 5.1 fmol/mg protein) was higher than that from female patients (2.6 +/- 1.7 fmol/mg protein). Another set of 100 thyroid tissues from normal (20 cases), Graves' disease (10), follicular adenoma (8), and papillary carcinoma (62) was also examined for the presence of estradiol (E2) using an immunohistochemical method on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. E2-positive tissues were found in 4 (40%) of 10 Graves' thyroids, 4 (50%) of 8 adenomas, and 47 (76%) of 62 papillary carcinomas. In 62 papillary carcinomas, E2-positive tissues were found in 37 (73%) of 51 female patients and 10 (91%) of 11 male patients. In relation to relapse of the carcinomas, E2-positive carcinomas were found in 10 (71%) of 14 patients with relapse of the disease and in 14 (54%) of 26 patients with no relapse (the difference was not significant). The findings indicate that thyroid carcinomas may be estrogen-dependent, but no definite conclusions could be drawn between the biological behavior of the tumors and the E2-positivity. \nUrinary cotinine measurement in patients with Buerger's disease--effects of active and passive smoking on the disease process. Although Buerger's disease is known to be closely related to smoking, no objective analysis of the smoke-associated problems has been performed. In this study, cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, was used as a sensitive marker to measure levels of active smoking and the exposure of nonsmokers to tobacco smoke because it has a relatively long half-life and because cotinine levels can be determined by noninvasive means in urine. According to urinary cotinine levels, 40 patients with Buerger's disease were classified as (1) smokers: those with urinary cotinine levels above 50 ng/mg creatinine; (2) passive smokers: those with levels between 10 and 50 ng/mg creatinine; and (3) nonsmokers who did not experience noticeable passive smoking: those with levels below 10 ng/mg creatinine. There were 10 smokers, 9 passive smokers, and 21 nonsmokers. The course of the disease, after the initial treatment at our hospital, was studied retrospectively. Seven of the 10 smokers, none of the 9 passive smokers, and 4 of the 21 nonsmokers experienced aggravation of the disease. Of the four nonsmokers who experienced aggravation, three had still been smokers and one had been exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace at the time of relapse. There was a significant difference in the aggravation rate between the smokers' group and the other two groups. Among the smokers, the seven patients whose conditions worsened showed significantly higher cotinine levels than the three remaining patients who were in the stage of remission. \nIncidence and outcome of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia among residents of Rochester, Minnesota: 1980-87. A population-based study. The incidence and outcome of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was studied in Rochester, Minnesota, during the period 1980-1987. Three hundred thirty Rochester men without a diagnosis of prostate or bladder cancer underwent prostatectomy for BPH for the first time. Mean and median ages were both seventy (range: 46-95). The incidence of initial prostatectomy for BPH among men forty-five years of age and older age-adjusted to the 1980 U.S. white male population was 642 cases per 100,000 persons per year (py). Among the 330 men undergoing initial prostatectomy for BPH, 14 (4.2%) had serious intraoperative complications, 32 (9.7%) were rehospitalized for urologic complications within thirty days of surgery, and 13 (3.9%) had other serious complications within thirty days after surgery, including 1 death (surgical mortality 0.3%). Forty-five patients (14%) required blood transfusions within thirty days of surgery. The likelihood of reoperation within six years of the initial surgery was 15.1 percent (95% CI 9.7, 20.6). Short- and long-term postoperative mortality was not statistically significantly different than expected based on age- and sex-specific mortality statistics for Rochester, Minnesota. \nCerebral haemorrhage in a French prospective population study. The incidence of cerebral haemorrhage was studied from a population-based stroke registry. The incidence was 12.3 per 100,000 per year in women and 13.9 per 100,000 per year in men, with a peak in the eighth decade and a male preponderance. Haemorrhages were deep seated and mostly due to hypertension. Recognised clinical characteristics of haemorrhage are acute onset, convulsion, vomiting, and disturbed consciousness. This study showed that cerebral haemorrhage may present with pure motor deficit or transient deficit preceding the stroke. The mortality was 51% in the first month, and 61% by two years. \nTorticollis in children. Torticollis is a common clinical sign that is found in a variety of disorders. Childhood torticollis differs from the adult form in that congenital types are common and many frequently encountered disorders found in adults are unusual. Pediatric torticollis related to otolaryngologic conditions is reviewed, and three illustrative cases are presented. \nPeritonitis due to Rhizopus in a patient undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. A 61-year-old man who had end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension developed peritonitis due to infection with Rhizopus as a complication of receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). At the onset of infection, the patient was neither acidemic nor hyperglycemic; in addition, deferoxamine had not been administered and Elastoplast dressings had not been applied. The infection occurred after the technique for disinfection of the catheter used for CAPD had been changed. The catheter was removed, and therapy with amphotericin B was initiated. Although the patient died of apparently unrelated causes, an autopsy revealed active fungal infection with multiple abscesses and superficial invasion of the ileal wall. \nPouchitis--is it a wastebasket diagnosis? Pouchitis is a poorly defined syndrome that is unique to patients with an ileal reservoir. During a prospective follow-up review of 215 patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, pouchitis was diagnosed in 30 patients (14 percent). Based on the clinical course, two distinct patterns of pouchitis were recognized: patients who experienced two or fewer episodes (Group 1-18 patients) and patients who experienced at least three episodes (Group 2-12 patients). Histopathologic review of resected colons revealed a preponderance of indeterminate colitis in patients in Group 2 (58.3 percent) compared with patients in Group 1 (0 percent). In Group 1; 88.9 percent of patients responded to therapy with metronidazole. Only 25 percent of patients in Group 2 responded to metronidazole alone. Most patients in Group 2 required sulfasalazine, topical steroids, or both. Of the 30 patients with pouchitis, four (13.3 percent) had a distinct endoscopic pattern of distal inflammation. This subset of patients with short strip pouchitis was successfully treated with topical steroid preparations. The clinical differences suggest different causes of pouchitis in these two groups. \nCapillary haemangiomas: an approach to their management. Twenty-five children with eyelid haemangiomas were reviewed. Fifteen patients with enlarging lesions thought to be at risk of causing amblyopia were treated with intralesional steroids as soon after presentation as possible. This appeared to reduce significantly the incidence of amblyopia. Surgery was reserved for older children in whom no further involution of the lesion was expected. \nSnoring and the risk of ischemic brain infarction. To determine if a history of snoring is a risk factor for brain infarction, I conducted a case-control study of risk factors for ischemic stroke using 177 consecutive male patients aged 16-60 (mean 49) years with acute brain infarction. For each patient I chose an age-matched (+/- 6 years) male control. Arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, snoring (habitually or often), and heavy drinking (greater than 300 g/wk) were risk factors in the stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio of snoring for brain infarction was 2.13. By McNemar's test this association increased strongly if a history of sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obesity were all present with snoring (odds ratio 8.00). My study indicates that snoring may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, possibly because of the higher prevalence of an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome among snorers than nonsnorers. \nTemperature-dependent modulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression in cultured human astroglial cells by dexamethasone and indomethacin. In bacterial meningitis, LPS induces production in cerebrospinal fluid of the cytokines IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), which are the principle mediators of meningeal inflammation. IL-1 beta and TNF alpha induce fever, and elevated temperature may affect cytokine expression. Dexamethasone treatment improves outcome in bacterial meningitis possibly by inhibiting IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. In this report, the effects of elevated temperature and dexamethasone on LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA gene expression and protein synthesis were studied in human astrocytoma cell lines and primary cultures of human fetal astrocytes. Cells cultured at 40 degrees C exhibited smaller peaks of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha transcription and protein synthesis compared with cells cultured at 37 degrees C. The addition of dexamethasone before, during, or after exposure of the cells to LPS resulted in temperature-dependent inhibition of IL-1 beta transcription and protein synthesis. The most extensive inhibition occurred in pretreated cells cultured at 37 degrees C. Cotreatment with LPS and dexamethasone also inhibited TNF alpha mRNA transcription at both temperatures. The effects of another antiinflammatory agent, indomethacin, on LPS induction of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA were temperature and cell line dependent. These findings provide a possible explanation for the efficacy of dexamethasone treatment of bacterial meningitis and support the proposal that fever may be beneficial to the host in this disease. \nAnal tonometry: a quick method of anal manometry. Evaluation of anal sphincter tonic activity is important in the proctologic clinic. However, manometric techniques are expensive, complex, and only available in some centers. Because there is often an in-office need for having objective measurements of anal tonic activity, in our clinic we introduced a simple method for measurement of anal pressures. This method is based on the flow of air in an open circuit by using a rubber probe with a side opening at one end. Pressure is assessed by an ordinary manometric gauge for arterial pressure. With this simple instrument, the following parameters are measured: 1) anal resting pressure, 2) squeeze pressure, 3) functional length of the anal canal, and 4) descent of the perineum on staining. After testing the technique in 100 healthy persons, it was applied to 130 patients with several proctologic disorders. Differences in pressures were found between controls and patients with anal fissure (high resting pressures), and patients with anal incontinence (low resting and/or squeeze pressures). A correlation was also found between the descending perineum measured by this method and by defecography. This simple instrument is useful in the office as the first approach to the function of the anal sphincters and the pelvic floor. Nowadays, so-called anal tonometry is part of the proctologic examination in our department, because it is simple, reliable, and takes only a few minutes. \nAnalysis of inflammatory cells and complement C3 in bupivacaine-induced myonecrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis of the inflammatory cells and complement C3 in the rat skeletal muscle was performed chronologically in bupivacaine-induced myonecrosis. At 30 minutes after injection, polymorphonuclear leukocytes appeared and increased in number, with a peak value at 12 hours, while macrophages reached the highest level at 2 days. In contrast, T cells comprised only a small population. Two weeks after the injection, all types of the inflammatory cells returned to the normal level. Deposition of complement C3 was recognized at 60 minutes at the surface membrane of degenerating muscle fiber. Our observation suggests the importance of both polymorphonuclear leukocytes and complement C3 in the early stage, and macrophages in the later stage of bupivacaine-induced myonecrosis. In addition, our findings cast doubt on the pathological significance of T cells in this model. \nAnterior urethral polyp associated with hematuria in six-year-old child. Anterior urethral polyps are rare, occur only in male patients, and have been associated with obstruction, terminal hematuria, and enuresis. We believe this is the fifth reported case of anterior urethral polyp associated with terminal hematuria. The radiographic findings, treatment, and pathology are reviewed. \nToward an integrated understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. II. Psychological and phenomenological aspects. The present paper is the second of a 2-part series in which extant empirical literature concerning fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is reviewed in order to provide a preliminary approach to forming an integrated understanding of the syndrome. Research on psychological disturbance in FS is reviewed with particular emphasis on affective dysfunction among FS patients. The phenomenology of FS is then described. We attempt to suggest that FS represents a quantitatively and qualitatively experience distinct from similar chronic pain syndromes. Substantive findings in FS research are summarized in the final section and potential ways in which these findings might be integrated to provide a more cohesive model for future research are suggested. \nProtracted outbreak of severe delta hepatitis: experience in an isolated Amerindian population of the Upper Orinoco basin. In an investigation of a 21-year-old epidemic of severe hepatitis, 80 serum samples were studied from two isolated Yanomami Amerindian populations of the Upper Orinoco basin in Venezuela. Of the assayed samples, 30.6% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), 53.7% were considered to reflect immunity to infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and only 16.2% were believed to reflect susceptibility to HBV infection; 82.5% of the samples tested positive for any marker of HBV infection. Thirty-one (39.7%) of 78 samples were also positive for antibody to delta antigen, including 91.6% of those positive for HBsAg and 20.9% of those immune to HBV. Our findings provide evidence of a high prevalence of HBV infection in this population. Furthermore, the high prevalence of antibody to delta antigen strongly suggests that coinfections with HBV or superinfections with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in HBV carriers may be an important factor in the occurrence of an unusually high number of cases of fulminant hepatitis and of chronic liver disease. Serum samples obtained at the beginning of the outbreak 13 years earlier from 36 selected cases in the same population revealed a high rate of HBV infection (96.5%). All six HBsAg carriers from whom enough serum remained to be assayed were positive for antibody to delta antigen. Our findings indicate that the outbreak coincided with the introduction of HDV into a population with an already-high prevalence of HBV infection. \nHepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection mimicking metastatic cancer to the liver. A cholestatic syndrome caused by sclerosing cholangitis and papillary stenosis has been described in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection. The case of a 41-year-old homosexual man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and cholestasis is reported. A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram showed that the extrahepatic and right-sided intrahepatic ducts were normal. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver. Guided needle biopsies of several of these lesions showed severe confluent necrotizing pericholangitis with cytomegalovirus-infected cells. Numerous cryptosporidia were seen attached to biliary epithelium. The unique histopathologic and radiographic features of this case should be added to the spectrum of hepatobiliary manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \nObstructed central venous catheters. Restoring function with a 12-hour infusion of low-dose urokinase. Thrombotic obstruction frequently prohibits infusion through or withdrawal of blood from central venous catheters and can occur in conjunction with symptomatic thrombosis of the subclavian vein. Thirty catheters were radiographically proved to be obstructed by thrombus and had not responded to at least one instillation of 5000 units of urokinase. All catheters were treated with a 12-hour infusion of urokinase at the rate of 40,000 units/hour. The obstructing thrombus was either eliminated or reduced in size in all instances and full function was restored in all but one catheter. No bleeding complications were seen. Six patients with obstructed catheters also had symptoms of subclavian vein thrombosis. All patients with symptoms of subclavian vein obstruction became asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy even though no attempt at dissolving the thrombus obstructing the subclavian vein was made. A 12-hour infusion of low doses of urokinase can safely salvage function of obstructed catheters that otherwise may require replacement. Patients with concomitant subclavian vein thrombosis become asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy without need to dissolve the obstructing thrombus. \nEnhanced tumor growth of both primary and established human and murine tumor cells in athymic mice after coinjection with Matrigel. Previously we found that the reconstituted basement membrane matrix Matrigel, when premixed with human small-cell lung carcinoma cells and injected subcutaneously into athymic mice, permitted tumor growth, whereas cells injected in the absence of Matrigel did not form tumors. In the present study, we examined additional cell types and determined some of the underlying mechanisms involved in the promotion of tumor formation by Matrigel. The tumor cell lines that we studied included transformed mouse Englebreth-Holm-Swarm tumor cells (T-EHS), human submandibular carcinoma A253 cells, mouse melanoma B16F10 cells, human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells, and human primary renal cell carcinoma cells. When coinjected subcutaneously with Matrigel, these cell lines formed rapidly proliferating tumors. Primary biopsy specimens of human colon carcinoma, when dispersed and coinjected with Matrigel, also formed tumors. Only A253, KB, and B16F10 cells formed small tumors in the absence of Martrigel, but a fivefold to tenfold increase in tumor size was observed in the presence of Matrigel. These data demonstrate a useful method for improving the growth of human tumors in athymic mice. \nGM2-gangliosidosis B1 variant: analysis of beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene mutations in 11 patients from a defined region in Portugal. The GM2-gangliosidosis B1 variant occurs at an exceptionally high frequency in the northern part of Portugal. In most patients, the disease manifests itself as a juvenile form, as opposed to the late-infantile form described for many patients from other parts of the world. We have analyzed the beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene in 11 patients, as well as in some relatives, in order to characterize the underlying abnormalities. They were screened for the two previously identified mutations responsible for the B1 variant phenotype (G533----A, also designated as the \"DN allele,\" and C532---T) by PCR amplification of an 800-bp DNA fragment and subsequent dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides. The fragment amplified from one patient was also subcloned and sequenced. Ten patients, constituting a clinically and biochemically homogeneous group, were found to be homozygous for the DN allele. The other, whose clinical profile more resembled the late-infantile phenotype often described in the literature, was a compound heterozygote carrying the DN allele and another, as yet unidentified, abnormal allele. Our results, corroborated by previously published data, suggest that homozygotes and compound heterozygotes for the DN allele may be distinguishable at the phenotypic level, depending on the nature of the abnormality in the other allele. A common ancestral origin for the DN allele can also be postulated. \nTotal cavopulmonary anastomosis versus conventional modified Fontan procedure. The total cavopulmonary anastomosis, lateral tunnel Fontan, has been advocated as a preferred method for Fontan type repair. From 1987 to July 1990, 39 patients underwent total cavopulmonary anastomoses (group 1) and 39 patients underwent modified Fontan procedures (group 2); patients receiving adjustable atrial septal defects were excluded. Diagnoses in group 1 included tricuspid atresia in 5 patients, single ventricle in 32, and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in 2. Diagnoses in group 2 included tricuspid atresia in 20, single ventricle in 17, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in 1, and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in 1. There were no significant differences in age, weight, cross-clamp time, duration of inotropic support, postoperative effusions, or hospital stay between the two groups. Early mortality in group 1 was 7.7% (3/39) and in group 2, 2.6% (1/39). There was no difference in the incidence of early dysrhythmias or early pacemaker placement. Late mortality was 2.8% in group 1 and 8% in group 2 with a mean follow-up of 18 and 25 months, respectively. Follow-up in group 1 revealed 33 patients in normal sinus rhythm and 1 patient with episodes of supraventricular tachycardia; no additional patients have required pacemakers. Follow-up in group 2 revealed 27 patients in normal sinus rhythm and supraventricular tachycardia in 4 patients; 5 additional patients have required pacemaker placement. There is no apparent difference in early outcome between the total cavopulmonary anastomosis and the conventional modified Fontan. However, there appears to be an increased incidence of late dysrhythmias and the need for pacemaker placement in the conventional modified Fontan group compared with the lateral tunnel group. \nIs adult-onset coeliac disease due to a low-grade lymphoma of intraepithelial T lymphocytes? Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma commonly presents with malabsorption, and debate continues as to whether adult-onset coeliac disease (CD) is itself a form of low-grade lymphoma. A 59-year-old man with adult-onset CD required resection of a segment of oedematous jejunum. Histological examination of this tissue revealed an intense intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Immunophenotypic (CD3-, CD4-, CD8-, CD34-, and CD45 RO-) and cytogenetic (deletion of the Y chromosome and chromosome 9) abnormalities were found, together with monoclonal T-cell-receptor gene rearrangements. Some patients with adult-onset CD may have low-grade lymphoma from the outset of their illness. \nTreatment of pancreatic pseudocysts with octreotide. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common and painful complication of chronic pancreatitis. Seven patients (six male, one female; mean age 49.9 years) with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts and persistent pain were treated with the pancreatic anti-secretory drug octreotide for 2 weeks. Octreotide caused no notable changes in the size of the pseudocysts of three patients. In the remaining four patients, the pseudocysts decreased in size by a mean of 42% (range 29-52%), and pain disappeared completely. These findings suggest a role for octreotide in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. \nIntussusception in cystic fibrosis. Two cases of acute intussusception in older children with cystic fibrosis are reported. Both cases presented with symptoms and signs consistent with meconium ileus equivalent, which delayed the final diagnosis. Both cases required abdominal surgery but made full and uneventful recoveries. \nHome monitoring of transcutaneous oxygen tension in the early detection of hypoxaemia in infants and young children. Twenty three patients (age range 0.5-40 months) with recurrent cyanotic episodes underwent physiological recordings, including transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) from a monitor modified for use at home (Kontron 821S). Of 69 episodes in which the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2, Nellcor N200) was less than or equal to 80% for greater than or equal to 20 seconds and/or central cyanosis was present, the TcPO2 monitor alarmed (less than or equal to 20 mmHg or 2.67 kPa) in every episode. The pulse oximeter identified hypoxaemia in 62 out of 69 episodes, failing in seven episodes due to signal loss from movement artefact. In only seven of 69 episodes was there an accompanying apnoeic pause (greater than or equal to 20 seconds), and heart rate fell to less than or equal to 80 beats/minute in only five of 28 episodes in which an electrocardiogram was recorded. In 32 episodes in which SaO2 fell to less than or equal to 60%, the TcPO2 monitor alarmed after a median time interval of 16 seconds (maximum time interval 30 seconds). The TcPO2 monitor was then used in an uncontrolled trial at home in 350 patients at increased risk of sudden death and/or hypoxaemia. Indications for monitoring included apparent life threatening events or cyanotic episodes (n = 163), prematurity and prematurity related disorders (n = 86), and sudden unexpected death in one or more siblings (n = 122). The TcPO2 monitor detected cyanotic episodes at home in 81 patients, 52 of whom received vigorous stimulation and/or mouth to mouth resuscitation. Twenty one of these 52 patients had further hypoxaemic episodes documented in hospital with pulse oximetry. \nHow AIDS forces reappraisal of hepatitis B virus control in sub-Saharan Africa For developing countries the cost-benefit of vaccination in the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is great since the acute infection is generally subclinical and the benefit is the prevention of small numbers of cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since the pattern of HBV infection in Africa is such that, compared with south-east Asia, infection occurs later in childhood and spread is horizontal rather than vertical, investigation of the method of spread of HBV may result in a means of control other than by vaccination. In the meantime, because of the overlap in the means by which HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are spread, it could be worthwhile taking advantage of existing AIDS prevention programmes to educate people about how to avoid both HBV and HIV infections. \nTreatment of oesophageal perforation: a multivariate analysis. Perforation of the oesophagus was retrospectively analysed in 59 patients. Cause and extent of perforation, localization, quality of the oesophageal wall and therapeutic modes were subjected to univariate analysis. The perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus (39) were also subjected to multivariate analysis. Perforation of the cervical oesophagus is seldom lethal and can be adequately treated conservatively in the majority of cases. Perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus can be divided into two groups, with or without simultaneous perforation of the parietal pleura. The optimal treatment for the group with pleural perforation seems to be resection of the oesophagus and secondary reconstruction, although primary closure is indicated in selected early cases. Perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus confined to the mediastinum can be adequately treated conservatively in most patients. Perforation of the intra-abdominal oesophagus should be treated like any other intra-abdominal visceral perforation, by closure or diversion, even if this results in resection of the oesophagus. \nComparison of the Finapres and direct arterial pressure monitoring during profound hypotensive anaesthesia. The Finapres was compared with direct intraarterial pressure monitoring in 10 patients undergoing local resection of choroidal melanoma, an operation that requires a period of profound hypotension. Good agreement was recorded for systolic arterial pressure and heart rate over a range of pressures. However, agreement of mean and diastolic pressures was poor, with the Finapres tending to overestimate these values. In cases requiring profound hypotension, direct arterial pressure monitoring remains the method of choice. \nThe kissing balloon technique with two over-the-wire balloon catheters through a single 8-French guiding catheter. Some of the newer over-the-wire coronary angioplasty catheters have shaft sizes of 3.0 French (F) or less. The inner diameter of modern 8-F guiding catheters is large enough to accommodate two of such balloon catheters. We report a kissing balloon procedure with two over-the-wire catheters through a single 8-F guiding catheter. \nSuperior vena caval thrombosis detected by transesophageal echocardiography. Three patients with clinical suspicion of bacterial endocarditis, induced by either pacemaker or indwelling catheter, underwent transesophageal echocardiography. High short-axis cuts through the great vessels, however, revealed the presence of superior vena caval thrombus in all three patients. Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive in establishing the diagnosis of superior vena caval thrombus than surface echocardiography. Comparison of transesophageal echocardiography with other diagnostic modalities is needed in assessing its overall sensitivity and specificity. \nAntibody to hepatitis C virus in post-transfusion hepatitis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), their relation to outcome, and the seroconversion rate in patients with post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected serum specimens. SETTING: A referral-based university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty-three consecutive patients who developed non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis after open-heart surgery. All patients had follow-up with serial serum testing and clinical evaluation. The mean (+/- SD) duration of follow-up after hepatitis onset was 81 +/- 33 months (range, 13 to 132 months). Seventeen patients recovered after acute-phase illness, whereas 46 developed chronic disease which, in 30 cases, was confirmed histologically. MAIN RESULTS: Of 32 patients tested before transfusion, 1 (3.1%) had anti-HCV. Fifty-nine (93%) patients were anti-HCV positive during acute-phase hepatitis: Patients with \"early\" seroconversion (less than 15 days after hepatitis onset) did not differ from those with \"late\" seroconversion (greater than 60 days after onset) in epidemiologic, clinical, and biochemical features. The rate of anti-HCV positivity during acute-phase illness was not significantly different among patients who recovered (76%) compared with those who developed chronic disease (95%). At 6 to 12 months, patients whose disease resolved had lower antibody activity than those with progressive disease. Further, during long-term follow-up (1 to 9 years), 53% of patients whose disease resolved but only 6.9% of patients who had progressive disease became anti-HCV negative. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus is the major cause of post-transfusion hepatitis in Italy. The time to anti-HCV seroconversion varies widely after hepatitis onset and is not significantly associated with acute-phase features or outcome of disease. \nEffect of enalapril on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions and congestive heart failure. The SOLVD Investigators BACKGROUND. Patients with congestive heart failure have a high mortality rate and are also hospitalized frequently. We studied the effect of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on mortality and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure and ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.35. METHODS. Patients receiving conventional treatment for heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 1284) or enalapril (n = 1285) at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day in a double-bind trial. Approximately 90 percent of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional classes II and III. The follow-up averaged 41.4 months. RESULTS. There were 510 deaths in the placebo group (39.7 percent), as compared with 452 in the enalapril group (35.2 percent) (reduction in risk, 16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 26 percent; P = 0.0036). Although reductions in mortality were observed in several categories of cardiac deaths, the largest reduction occurred among the deaths attributed to progressive heart failure (251 in the placebo group vs. 209 in the enalapril group; reduction in risk, 22 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 35 percent). There was little apparent effect of treatment on deaths classified as due to arrhythmia without pump failure. Fewer patients died or were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (736 in the placebo group and 613 in the enalapril group; risk reduction, 26 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 18 to 34 percent; P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. The addition of enalapril to conventional therapy significantly reduced mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and reduced ejection fractions. \nImpact of diagnosis-related groups on the quality of postoperative care of patients with neck dissections. Two hundred eighty patients underwent neck dissection over a 10-year period: 138 during the 5-year period before the institution of Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) reimbursement and 142 during the 5 years after DRG regulations. A comparison of these two groups by site of tumor, stage of disease, histopathology, previous treatment, type of neck dissection, whether neck dissection was carried out alone or in combination with another procedure, presence of preexisting disease, postoperative complications, and mortality revealed no significant differences. A 35% reduction in the length of hospital stay from 16 to 10 days was identified in the post-DRG group with no detrimental effects on patient care. The variables found to have the greatest impact on length of hospital stay were the extent of operation and postoperative complications. \nThe long distance effects of brain lesions: visualization of axonal pathways and their terminations in the human brain by the Nauta method. This study aims at determining the reliability and the optimal post-injury survival time for the application of the Nauta technique to the analysis of the human brain. The Nauta method reveals the degeneration not only of nerve fibers, myelinated and unmyelinated, but also of their terminations. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations appear to prove that the Nauta technique indeed stains axons in human autopsy material. The optimal survival time for the use of the Nauta method was found to be between nine days and five months. In cases with longer survival times--up to 20 months--the Nauta technique and a previously proposed polarizing technique (showing birefringent breakdown products of myelin) can be used as complementary methods. Applying these techniques to the human brain may help define the anatomical basis of neurological and neuropsychological symptoms important for man. \nAmino acid alterations and encephalopathy in the sepsis syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of amino acid profiles in septic encephalopathy. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Medical wards and medical ICU of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with infections and normal mental status were compared with patients with septic shock and altered sensorium. INTERVENTIONS: Plasma amino acid levels and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with septic shock and altered sensorium had higher circulating concentrations of ammonia (425 +/- 55 vs. 127 +/- 7 mmol/L) and the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine (122 +/- 19 vs. 74 +/- 3 mmol/L) and tryptophan (97 +/- 7 vs. 32 +/- 13 mmol/L), and lower levels of the branch-chain amino acid isoleucine (48 +/- 7 vs. 68 +/- 5 mmol/L) than patients with infections and normal sensorium (p less than .05). Aromatic amino acid levels correlated with APACHE II scores (R2 = .4, p less than .001) and mortality. APACHE II scores were higher in the septic shock patients (30 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 1, p less than .001), and these patients had a higher mortality rate (71% vs. 12%, p less than .01). Patients with septic shock who died had higher levels of ammonia (524 +/- 58 vs. 227 +/- 40 mmol/L, p less than .05) and sulfur-containing amino acids (172 +/- 31 vs. 61 +/- 7 mmol/L, p less than .05) than patients who survived. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma amino acid profiles appear to be important in septic encephalopathy and the severity of septic disease. \nClinical significance of two forms of IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus. Separation of 7-8 S and 19 S forms of serum IgM antibodies to the hepatitis delta virus by rate-zonal centrifugation was carried out on serum from 24 patients with hepatitis delta virus infection: 4 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis; 5 patients with hepatitis delta virus superinfection progressing to chronicity; and 15 patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus. The high molecular weight IgM form (19 S) was predominantly detected in acute hepatitis delta virus cases, whereas the low molecular weight (7 S) form was found in chronic hepatitis delta virus cases. The serological profile of these two forms of IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus was investigated in serial samples from five patients with acute hepatitis delta virus superinfection that evolved to chronic hepatitis delta virus. We found that, in the acute stage of the disease, the 19 S form was predominant, whereas 6 mo later a predominance of 7-8 S IgM was observed. These results suggest that IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus antibody forms are different in acute and chronic hepatitis delta virus infection and that their detection only helps in differentiating an acute infection from a chronic infection but not a hepatitis delta virus-hepatitis B virus-HBV coinfection from hepatitis delta virus superinfection in the acute stage of the disease. \nCombined surgical and interventional radiological approach for complex benign biliary tract obstruction. In patients with complicated high benign biliary strictures surgical technique alone cannot exclude the possibility of recurrent problems, and hepatic atrophy/hypertrophy, portal hypertension and intrahepatic stones may all complicate surgical management. A multidisciplinary approach to these complex cases, which minimizes the need for repeated surgical interventions, has been pursued. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed and an extended limb of the jejunum brought to the abdominal wall to allow access for later radiological intervention. Over a 30-month period 58 biliary-enteric anastomoses for benign disease were performed. Seventeen of these 58 patients were managed using the combined approach. Ten of these 17 patients had complex postcholecystectomy strictures and seven had strictures resulting from inflammatory disease, hepatic resection or congenital problems. A new classification of results of management of bile duct strictures is proposed. Seven patients were classified as 'excellent', six 'good', two 'fair' and two 'poor'. Results were obtained at a mean follow-up of 16 months and it seems likely that in some patients major surgical reinterventions were avoided. \nHereditary unstable DNA: a new explanation for some old genetic questions? Fragile X syndrome, associated with the fragile X chromosome, is the most common cause of familial mental retardation. The condition is characterised by a heritable DNA sequence that consists of an abnormal number of CCG repeats, and which is unstable in both mitosis and meiosis. We suggest that such heritable unstable DNA sequences could be present in other parts of the genome and that these might explain a number of genetic events that are not well understood in terms of classic genetic mechanisms. Such poorly explained observations include anticipation, incomplete penetrance, variable expression, and possibly imprinting, variegation, and multifactorial inheritance. \nSignificance of elevated levels of serum creatine phosphokinase in febrile diseases: a prospective study. The incidence and significance of elevated serum levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in febrile diseases were studied prospectively in all patients admitted with fever to a department of medicine during 1 year. High serum CPK levels were detected in 70 (28%) of 247 febrile patients but in only six (6%) of 105 afebrile control patients (P = .0001). Elevated CPK levels were not related to any specific diagnosis. Logistic regression analysis identified five factors that correlated both significantly and independently with elevation of CPK values: increased blood urea nitrogen level, low serum phosphate level, a stuporous or comatose state, tremor, and muscle tenderness. Myoglobinuria, detected in 14 patients, was predictive of a fatal outcome, but a high CPK level by itself was not an independent correlate of mortality. In summary, CPK elevation is not uncommon in febrile diseases, but because it does not reflect a specific etiology it does not necessarily indicate that an extensive diagnostic work-up is required. \nAsymmetrical ocular pursuit with posterior fossa tumors. We report two patients with posterior fossa neoplasms who demonstrated asymmetrically impaired horizontal ocular pursuit documented with electrooculography. One patient had impaired pursuit contralateral to a pontomedullary lesion, whereas the second patient had impaired pursuit ipsilateral to a pontocerebellar lesion. These patients demonstrate that posterior fossa lesions may impair ocular pursuit either contralaterally or ipsilaterally unlike cerebral hemispheric lesions, which impair ocular pursuit ipsilaterally or bilaterally. \nEffects of a minimally supervised exercise program for mentally retarded adults. Previous exercise studies that attempted to improve the cardiovascular fitness (CVF) of mentally retarded (MR) adults were flawed with methodological shortcomings that prevented conclusive results. At issue in these training studies were fitness test validity and reliability, exactness of duration and intensity of training, and an inordinate amount of supervision. Therefore, we sought to determine whether moderately MR adults (seven males, five females; IQ = 61 +/- 3, age = 25 +/- 3 yr) could improve their CVF through a minimally supervised 16-wk training program. Each subject repeated exercise tests twice on two different modes of exercise, the treadmill (TM) and Schwinn Air-Dyne ergometer (SAE), before training to ensure validity and reliability of initial CVF levels. Intensity and frequency of exercise were closely monitored. An observer was present during the training bouts, but, following initial instructions, no additional encouragement or instructions were given. Although the training program significantly increased peak VO2 (29.2 +/- 8 to 33.5 +/- 9 ml.kg-1.min-1) and peak ventilation (73 +/- 26 to 81 +/- 231.min-1) when assessed on the TM, significant changes in these same parameters were not seen when assessed on the SAE. The importance of these results was discussed. \nCardiac pacemaker in high spinal cord injury. Bradycardia followed by cardiac arrest is well documented as a complication of acute injury to the cervical spinal cord. This life-threatening bradycardia is attributed to an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system resulting from dissociation of the parasympathetic from the sympathetic responses during the stage of spinal shock. A patient with a C2 complete quadriplegia secondary to birth trauma who experienced symptomatic bradycardia, continuing for 21 months after injury despite intensive medical management, is reported. Clinical improvement followed insertion of a cardiac pacemaker. Possible etiologies for the continuation of abnormal bradycardia episodes after the resolution of spinal shock are discussed. Cardiac pacemaker implantation is advocated for patients with high cervical spinal cord injuries and continuing symptomatic bradycardia not responding to medical measures. \nThe risk of dying of prostate cancer in patients with clinically localized disease. From 1966 to 1979, 360 patients with clinical stages A2, B and C1 prostate cancer underwent staging pelvic lymphadenectomy, and completed a course of combined interstitial radioactive gold seeds and external beam radiotherapy. All patients had a normal serum prostatic acid phosphatase level and a bone scan negative for metastases. All patients were followed until death or for a mean of 7.3 years (range 1.2 to 18.25 years) for those alive at analysis. To determine the risk of dying of prostate cancer we reviewed the records of the 142 patients (39%) who died. At analysis 21% of the patients had died of prostate cancer and 17% of other known causes. The cause of death could not be determined in 4 patients (1%). Cardiovascular disease accounted for a fifth of all deaths. The actuarial risk of death of prostate cancer for all patients was 8 +/- 3% (+/- 2 standard errors) at 5 years and 30 +/- 7% at 10 years. The risk of death of all causes was 16 +/- 4% at 5 years and 46 +/- 7% at 10 years. An increased risk of cancer death was associated with established risk factors, including advanced local disease, poorly differentiated histology, pelvic nodal metastases and distant recurrence. We also noted a substantial risk of cancer death in patients who had local tumor recurrence. While previous studies have reported a relatively low incidence of cancer deaths (4 to 17%) in patients initially diagnosed with localized disease, our data suggest that prostate cancer is the major cause of mortality in such patients. Aggressive curative therapy, regardless of treatment modality, should be considered for localized prostate cancer in men with a life expectancy of 10 or more years. \nSelf-inflicted eye injuries. Five cases of self-inflicted eye injury are described and discussed. A review of the literature shows that several psychiatric diagnoses have been assigned to people who damage their eyes. A variety of mechanisms to explain this phenomenon are described. \nDry beriberi: unusual complication of prolonged parenteral nutrition. An adult with Crohn's disease on home total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 8 months presented with peripheral neuropathy and ataxia. The patient was found to be deficient of thiamine. A prompt symptomatic response to intravenous thiamine suggests that the patient had the chronic form of dry beriberi. To our knowledge, this variety of beriberi in a patient on TPN has not previously been reported. \nDouble-blind investigation of the effects of propranolol and placebo on the pressure of esophageal varices in patients with portal hypertension. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of propranolol on esophageal variceal pressure in patients with portal hypertension. Variceal pressure was measured at endoscopy using a miniature pressure-sensitive gauge in 20 patients with portal hypertension. Measurements were obtained under baseline conditions and 20 min after double-blind administration of propranolol (0.15 mg/kg; n = 10) or an identical amount of placebo (normal saline, 0.3 ml/kg; n = 10). Under baseline conditions, variceal pressure was similar in propranolol and placebo groups (14.1 +/- 5 mm Hg vs. 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg, respectively; not significant). Placebo had no significant effect on variceal pressure (baseline = 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; placebo = 15.5 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; not significant), and values after placebo administration were closely correlated with baseline values (r = 0.98; y = 1.1 + 0.97 x; p less than 0.0001). In contrast, propranolol caused a significant decrease in the pressure of esophageal varices (from 14.1 +/- 5 mm Hg to 11.3 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.0002). No significant changes in the size of esophageal varices were observed after propranolol or placebo administration. This study shows (a) the endoscopic pressure-gauge technique has a low variability and may be used to assess acute drug-induced changes in variceal pressure; and (b) propranolol causes significant decreases in variceal pressure in patients with portal hypertension and esophageal varices. \nAcute polyhydramnios associated with chorioangioma. A case report. A case of acute polyhydramnios occurred at 26 weeks' gestation. Prenatal sonography demonstrated a placental chorioangioma. Acute polyhydramnios is clinically distinct from nonacute polyhydramnios and carries a high perinatal mortality rate. As in our case, fetal death often results from complications of prematurity. \nAortic thrombosis after umbilical artery catheterization in neonates: prevalence of complications on long-term follow-up. We previously reported the early natural history of aortic thrombosis occurring after umbilical artery catheterization in 21 neonates. Ten of those neonates were reevaluated at 36-42 months of age for evidence of hypertension, renal abnormalities, and leg-growth disturbances. They were compared with an age-matched control group of seven infants. Blood pressures were greater than the 95th percentile in three infants and between the 50th and the 95th percentile in six of the 10 infants. Height was less than the fifth percentile for age in four infants with aortic thrombosis. One child had a 1.0-cm discrepancy in leg-length measurements, and seven of nine patients exhibited a 0.5-2.0 cm discrepancy between legs in either thigh or calf circumference. Sonography showed no evidence of residual clot in the aorta or renal vessels. Doppler flow was normal in all cases. Despite resolution of neonatal aortic thrombosis, complications resulting in renovascular hypertension (three of 10 patients) and leg-growth abnormalities (eight of nine) can occur. Hypertension (one of seven) and leg-growth discrepancy (four of seven) were less frequent in the 3-year follow-up of the seven matched control infants. We suggest that infants with known aortic thrombosis receive long-term follow-up to detect these potential problems. \nLight reflection rheography: an effective non-invasive technique for screening patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis. Light reflection rheography is a simple non-invasive technique for assessing venous function in the leg. One hundred and twenty-four patients referred for venography with a clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis were investigated by light reflection rheography to determine the accuracy of the technique in diagnosing acute thrombosis. In half of the patients venography confirmed a deep venous thrombosis. Light reflection rheography had a sensitivity of 92 per cent and a specificity of 84 per cent in detecting acute thrombosis. The technique had a negative predictive value of 92 per cent in selecting those patients with no thrombosis. Light reflection rheography can be performed at the bedside or in the radiography department which makes it a suitable technique for screening patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis. \nWildervanck or cervico-oculo-acoustic syndrome and MRI findings. In 1952, Wildervanck described the first case of what he styled the cervico-oculo-acoustic (COA) syndrome. This comprises Klippel Feil's (KF) anomaly (congenitally fused cervical vertebrae), congenital sensorineural deafness and Duane's retraction syndrome (deficient abduction with retraction on adduction). Since that original paper, there have been further reports describing this triad, either completely or incompletely. A further case of this syndrome is reported and the first report of MRI head scan findings in this condition is presented. In addition, the origin of mirror movements observed as part of the KF syndrome are discussed. \nAsymptomatic blastomycosis of the central nervous system with progression in patients given ketoconazole therapy: a report of two cases. Ketoconazole (KTZ) has largely replaced amphotericin B as first-line therapy for blastomycosis. However, KTZ penetrates poorly into the central nervous system (CNS), and therapeutic failure may be caused by initially unrecognized CNS infection. Two patients (22% [2/9] of all culture-proven cases of blastomycosis at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, over 15 years) developed CNS blastomycosis while receiving KTZ. Neither initially had CNS symptoms; both had cutaneous and pulmonary disease that responded to KTZ. If KTZ or other fungistatic imidazoles are to continue as primary therapy for blastomycosis, studies are needed to improve the ability to identify patients likely to experience treatment failure or develop CNS disease. Possibly all patients with disseminated blastomycosis, even those without CNS symptoms, should have lumbar puncture and computed tomography of the head before therapy. Critical evaluation of their immune function also may be required before making a therapeutic decision to use KTZ or amphotericin B. \nTreatment of rat prostatic adenocarcinoma with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA): effects on growth and morphology. Rats bearing the Dunning R3327H prostatic carcinoma were castrated and supplemented with testosterone propionate. These rats were then treated with estradiol benzoate or medroxyprogesterone acetate alone or in combination with estradiol. During the treatment period of six weeks, the growth rate of the prostatic tumors was measured. At the end of the treatment period the morphology of the tumors was also studied. It was found that medroxyprogesterone acetate is as effective as estradiol in inhibiting the growth of the Dunning prostatic carcinoma and that the combination of medroxyprogesterone acetate and estradiol was more efficient in that respect than estradiol alone. Morphometric evaluation of the tumor epithelium and stroma showed a decrement of epithelial growth in all treatment groups, while the groups treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate, both alone or in combination with estradiol, also showed an inhibited growth of the tumor stroma. It was concluded that medroxyprogesterone acetate probably has direct inhibitory effects on prostatic tumor cells in the Dunning model and that medroxyprogesterone acetate may act in an additive manner with estradiol. \nPharmacokinetics of activated protein C in guinea pigs. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen of the serine protease, activated protein C (APC), an important regulatory enzyme in hemostasis. In view of the potential of human APC as an anticoagulant and profibrinolytic agent, the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of APC were studied in guinea pigs. The plasma elimination of a trace dose of 125I-APC was biphasic following an initial rapid elimination of approximately 15% of the injected dose within 1 to 2 minutes. This rapid removal of 125I-APC from the circulation was found to be a result of an association with the liver regardless of the route of injection. Essentially identical results were obtained with active site-blocked forms of APC generated with either diisopropylfluorophosphate or D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone, which indicates that the active site was not essential for the liver association. Accumulation of all three forms of APC in the liver peaked at 30 minutes and then declined as increasing amounts of degraded radiolabeled material appeared in the gastrointestinal tract and urine. Removal of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (gla) domain of diisopropylphosphoryl-APC resulted in a 50% reduction in the association with liver and an accumulation in the kidneys. Protein C and protein S were cleared from the circulation at rates approximately one-half and one-fourth, respectively, that of APC. Both in vitro and in vivo, APC was found to form complexes with protease inhibitors present in guinea pig plasma. Complex formation resulted in a more rapid disappearance of the enzymatic activity of APC than elimination of the protein moiety. These findings indicate two distinct mechanisms for the elimination of APC. One mechanism involves reaction with plasma protease inhibitors and subsequent elimination by specific hepatic receptors. The other mechanism involves the direct catabolism of APC by the liver via a pathway that is nonsaturable over a substantial dose range and independent of the active site. This pattern of elimination is distinctly different from that observed with the homologous coagulation enzymes thrombin, factor IXa, and factor Xa. \nIntracarotid chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin for malignant brain tumors. Chemotherapy for tumors of the central nervous system has a limited efficacy presumably because of restricted blood-brain barrier permeability. The advantage of regional intra-arterial administration of anticancer drugs is an increased uptake during the first passage of the drugs through tumor capillaries. Twenty patients with high-grade astrocytomas (HGA) and 28 patients with metastatic brain tumors (MBT) received intracarotid/intravertebral infusion of etoposide and cisplatin. Eight patients with HGA who underwent incomplete resection responded to chemotherapy alone. Four additional patients had complete resection of the tumor. Median survival time of the group (responders and nonresponders) has been 14 months. Twelve patients with MBT responded to chemotherapy alone (six had complete response [CR], and six had partial response [PR]) with a median survival time of 7 months. Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) appears to be effective with acceptable toxicities. Accrual of additional patients is required before a final conclusion can be reached. \nHigh mebendazole doses in pulmonary and hepatic hydatid disease. Thirty nine children with 71 hydatid cysts were given mebendazole orally in a dose of 100-200 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks and were followed up for a mean (SD) of 63 (24) months. Twenty children (three of them after a second course) were cured and another two avoided at least one operation. No serious side effects of the drug were observed. \nConcomitant lymphangioma and arteriovenous malformation of the orbit. An 8-year-old girl had an orbital-adnexal lymphangioma and ipsilateral orbital and middle cranial fossa arteriovenous malformations. High-resolution magnetic resonance image scanning, orbital ultrasonography, and digital subtraction angiography were used for diagnosis and preoperative assessment. Complications related to this vascular neoplasm included amblyopia, acute hemorrhage with proptosis, exposure keratitis, cosmetic deformity, and recurrent preseptal cellulitis. The girl was treated with both embolization and orbital surgery for recurrent hemorrhage and proptosis. We postulated that the coexistence of a lymphangioma and arteriovenous malformation represents an unusual and extensive maldevelopment of vascular embryogenesis. \nImportance of 6-mercaptopurine dose in lymphoblastic leukaemia. To explore the possibility that higher total dosage of 'maintenance' treatment may have contributed to the recent improvement in outlook of children in the United Kingdom with lymphoblastic leukaemia, details of the amount of 6-mercaptopurine prescribed during the first two years of treatment were studied in an unselected cohort of children diagnosed between 1973 and 1987. Eighty five patients were studied, 30 diagnosed before and 55 after 1980. The group diagnosed after 1980 showed an 18% improvement in relapse free survival at five years. Their median total dose of 6-mercaptopurine had increased by 22%, whereas according to the protocol it should have risen by an average of only 9%. After 1980 boys were prescribed significantly more 6-mercaptopurine than girls, and had fewer dose reductions because of myelosuppression. These findings support the clinical impression that after 1980 an important therapeutic difference resulting from the new United Kingdom acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocols was an increase in the amount of 6-mercaptopurine that children actually received as a result of changes in prescribing guidelines rather than dose. They also provide further evidence that boys tolerate 6-mercaptopurine better than girls, which may be related to the still unexplained difference in prognosis between the sexes. \nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Workshop on antihypertensive drug treatment. The benefits, costs, and choices. Implications for research. Selected portions of the workshop's closing discussion are summarized. Major ongoing clinical trials of antihypertensive drug treatment are described. Some recommendations offered by workshop participants for future research directions are summarized. \nHypercholesterolemia: the cost of treatment in perspective. Would the money spent on treating hypercholesterolemia save more lives if spent elsewhere? How many dollars must be spent on a treatment to make one person live 1 year longer? This cost-effectiveness analysis uses the cost per year of life gained to compare a wide variety of health care interventions ranging from carcinogen research to screening tests to liver transplants. The comparison calls into question some popular trends. \nOral ketamine. Its use for mentally retarded adults requiring day care dental treatment. Four cases of severely mentally handicapped young adults requiring day care dental treatment are reported. All had required varying degrees of restraint during previous dental treatments, which had been distressing for the patient, the relatives and the ward staff. In all cases, administration of oral ketamine 10 mg/kg, 30-60 minutes before the procedure, facilitated subsequent induction of anaesthesia. \nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy: evolution, early results, and impact on nonsurgical gallstone therapies Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a surgical technique first performed in France, has gained widespread acceptance among surgeons in the United States. The abdominal cavity is inflated by carbon dioxide, a video monitor is inserted via a laparoscope placed periumbilically, and the gallbladder is freed and removed from the liver bed by using small subcostal ports for access and dissection. Intraoperative cholangiography is routinely performed, but uncertainty exists about how best to manage choledocholithiasis. Compared with traditional cholecystectomy, initial reports describing laparoscopic cholecystectomy cite shorter recovery times because no large incisions are made, thus potentially reducing the cost and morbidity of cholecystectomy. A survey of 614 early cases supports these claims, with a reported complication rate of 1.5% and quick resumption of normal activities by patients. Because of its promise for reduced morbidity, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is challenging open cholecystectomy as the therapeutic gold standard for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thus, the standard to which the nonsurgical gallstone therapies, such as lithotripsy and contact dissolution, will be compared may shift to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As the laparoscopic complications are similar to those of traditional cholecystectomy, such as abscesses and bile leaks, their percutaneous treatment should not change. \nRenal abscess in childhood: diagnostic and therapeutic progress. During the past decade new techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography have been reported to have changed the diagnostic investigation and treatment of renal abscess in adults. To evaluate whether similar changes have taken place in the pediatric age group, a retrospective study of all patients seen between 1979 and 1989 was performed. Seven patients, 0.8 to 14 (mean, 9) years old, with renal abscesses in eight kidneys were identified. Ultrasound and computed tomography proved to be the most valuable diagnostic tools, revealing the diagnosis by showing a hypoechoic or hypodense mass. All patients had an initial trial of intensive antibiotic treatment, which led to resolution of the abscesses in two of the eight kidneys. In all other cases the abscesses were additionally drained, which was done surgically in two and by ultrasonography- or CT-guided percutaneous drainage in four patients. Abscess cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus (three), Escherichia coli (one) and Salmonella Group B (one) and were sterile in one case. Drainage was unsuccessful in only one patient, who subsequently underwent nephrectomy for uncontrolled infection of a diffusely damaged kidney. We conclude that the diagnosis of renal abscesses is greatly facilitated by ultrasonography and CT and that most patients can be cured without operation by antibiotics and, if necessary, by additional percutaneous drainage. \nPotassium accumulation in the globally ischemic mammalian heart. A role for the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. We investigated the contribution of opening of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel to extracellular accumulation of K+ during ischemia with the use of glibenclamide, a specific blocker of this K+ channel. To characterize the electrophysiological effects of glibenclamide during metabolic inhibition (by either application of dinitrophenol or hypoxia) we performed patch-clamp studies in isolated membrane patches of guinea pig myocytes and in intact guinea pig myocytes and studied action potential parameters in isolated superfused guinea pig papillary muscle. We studied the effect of glibenclamide on extracellular accumulation of K+ and H+ in isolated retrogradely perfused globally ischemic hearts of rat, guinea pig, and rabbit. Experimental evidence is presented that supports the conclusions that glibenclamide 1) effectively blocks open K+ATP channels, 2) reverses the dinitrophenol-induced increase of the outward current and prevents the hypoxia-induced shortening of the action potential, 3) decreases the rate of K+ accumulation during the first minutes of ischemia in stimulated hearts, an effect which was entirely absent in quiescent hearts, and 4) does not influence the rate and extent of ischemia-induced extracellular acidification. \nPercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and early mortality. To assess morbidity, mortality, and benefit associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy (PEG), we retrospectively studied 42 patients who had had PEG. Mortality was exceptionally high during the first 60 days after PEG (43%), and then stabilized. In nearly half of the cases (20/42) the PEG tube was removed during the first 60 days because of either death or improvement. Patients with malignancy had a significantly higher morbidity and 60-day mortality than the neurologically impaired. We concluded that patients should be carefully selected for PEG because early mortality is high; a 60-day trial of soft nasogastric feedings should be considered before PEG, and could reduce by nearly half the number of patients failing to receive long-term benefit; and patients with malignancy have significantly greater morbidity and mortality after PEG and may not receive the same advantage from the procedure. \nUrologic sarcoma in adults. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center experience based on a prospective database between 1982 and 1989. Urologic sarcoma is a group of rare tumors with a generally poor prognosis. These sarcomas share prognostic characteristics with soft-tissue sarcomas arising from other sites. A staging system that incorporates tumor grade and size is valuable in identifying patients at high risk of dying of disease. Patients with sarcomas that are high-grade, greater than 5 cm in diameter, or metastatic at the time of presentation (MSKCC stages 3 and 4) have a combined 3-year relapse-free survival rate of 26%. Complete surgical resection, preferably with negative margins, still offers the best chance of cure. For reasons that are not clear, multimodality therapy in rhabdomyosarcoma is less effective in adult than in pediatric disease. Present-day chemotherapeutic regimens are ineffective in controlling disseminated sarcoma. The adoption of a uniform staging system coupled with multi-institutional collaboration may allow progress to be made in this otherwise deadly form of genitourinary cancer. \nvon Willebrand factor and factor VIII in renal transplant recipients under immunosuppression with cyclosporine and steroids. Sequential measurements over 4 months in 17 patients. In 17 consecutive cadaver kidney transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine (CsA) and steroids, the median of antigenic and functional levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) before transplantation were elevated (vWF:Ag: 206%, vWF:RCof: 202%; FVIII:Ag: 248%, FVIII:C: 224%; normal values 50-150%). Sequential measurements after transplantation and during CsA treatment revealed a transient significant increase of median values with highest amounts of vWF:Ag of 362% (2 p less than 0.0001), FVIII:Ag of 398% (2 p less than 0.001) and FVIII:C of 360% (2 p less than 0.0001) (Friedman test). vWF:RCof did not show statistically significant changes. After 4 months, levels of vWF and FVIII comparable to those obtained before transplantation were observed. In univariate statistical analysis no correlation was found between vWF of FVIII on the one hand and plasma creatinine levels, CsA dose or CsA whole blood through levels on the other hand. However, multivariate statistics revealed to some extent a positive influence of CsA blood levels on vWF:Ag levels. Patients with vascular rejection or chronic CsA nephrotoxicity showed significantly lower levels of vWF:Ag as compared with patients without endothelial cell damage in the kidney (2 p less than 0.05). However, the difference in vWF:Ag levels already existed before transplantation. In contrast to recent reports, plasma vWF levels were not indicative of vascular injury in kidney graft recipients nor was the marked elevation of vWF and FVIII associated with thromboembolic complications ascribed to CsA treatment. \nThe relationship between locomotor disability, autonomic dysfunction, and the integrity of the striatal dopaminergic system in patients with multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and Parkinson's disease, studied with PET. 18F-dopa and S-11C-nomifensine (NMF) are positron emitting tracers whose caudate and putamen uptake reflects striatal dopamine storage capacity and the integrity of dopamine reuptake sites, respectively. Using these two tracers, the integrity of the presynaptic striatal dopaminergic system has been studied with positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 subjects with multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome) who had an akinetic-rigid syndrome that was poorly responsive to L-dopa, autonomic failure, and cerebellar ataxia. PET findings for the 10 MSA patients were compared with those for 13 age-matched controls, 8 subjects with L-dopa responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), and 7 subjects with pure autonomic failure (PAF). Influx constants, Ki, reflecting specific 18F-dopa uptake into striatal tissue, were severely reduced in the putamen and caudate of the 10 MSA subjects (mean putamen Ki 0.005 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls; mean caudate Ki 0.007 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls). Reduction of putamen, but not caudate, 18F-dopa uptake correlated with severity and duration of locomotor disability. Eight patients with PD, and a similar degree and duration of locomotor disability to the patients with MSA, demonstrated equal impairment of mean putamen 18F-dopa uptake, but significant preservation of mean caudate function. The 7 PAF patients had normal mean levels of putamen and caudate 18F-dopa uptake, although 1 individual PAF patient had significantly impaired striatal function. The MSA and PD groups of subjects both showed significantly reduced levels of specific striatal S-11C-NMF binding, again caudate function being relatively preserved in PD. It is concluded that in both MSA and PD there is a parallel decline of striatal dopamine storage capacity and reuptake site integrity, probably reflecting a loss of nigrostriatal nerve terminals. Caudate function is relatively preserved in PD compared with MSA. The majority of PAF patients have an intact nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, suggesting that PAF is a condition distinct from PD and MSA in spite of some pathological similarities. PET is capable of detecting subclinical nigrostriatal involvement in PAF patients when this is present. \nMuscle regeneration following segmental necrosis in tenotomized muscle fibers. The aim of this study was to determine how the new myotendinous junctions were re-established at the proximal and distal ends of the soleus muscle after tenotomy. Both proximal and distal tendons of the soleus muscle in mature female rats were severed. The animals were killed and the soleus muscles were removed and prepared for light and electron microscopic examination 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after the operation. It was found that segmental fiber destruction followed by removal by macrophages occurred at the ends of the soleus muscle fibers. This resulted in the liberation and myogenic activation of satellite cells. By 3 days after tenotomy the fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes could be seen. The myotubes developed within the original basal lamina and reattached to the surviving non-necrotic segments and grew in both length and width so that by 6 weeks postoperation, normal myotendinous junctions had been reformed. This study is the first to show that re-establishment of the myotendinous junction following tenotomy is accomplished by regeneration of the necrotic ends of the tenotomized fibers. \nComposition of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries in women less than 40 years of age with fatal coronary artery disease and implications for plaque reversibility. This study analyzes the composition of atherosclerotic plaques in the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries in 8 women less than 40 years of age (mean 34) with fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) and compares these data to previous studies of 37 adults greater than 45 years of age (mean 59) with fatal CAD. Histologic sections were taken at 5-mm intervals from the entire lengths of the right, left main, left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. With the use of a computerized morphometry system, analysis of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries showed the major component of plaque to be a combination of cellular (mean percent total plaque area = 65%, standard error = 6%) and dense (19%, standard error = 6%) fibrous tissue. Arterial segments narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area from these young women were compared with similarly narrowed arteries from 37 older patients (32 men [86%]) with fatal CAD previously reported by this laboratory, and showed significantly more cellular fibrous tissue and lipid-rich foam cells, and lesser amounts of dense fibrous and heavily calcified tissue. The large amount of lipid-containing foam cells and relative lack of acellular scar tissue in coronary plaques in these young women suggests a greater potential for reversibility of these plaques in this subset of patients with CAD. \nOrbit-related variation in spatial resolution as a source of artifactual defects in thallium-201 SPECT The cause of 180-degree diametrical artifactual defects in clinical thallium-201 SPECT imaging was investigated using phantom simulation. This artifact was observed on SPECT images acquired with a \"body contour\" or \"peanut\" orbit. It was hypothesized that this artifact was caused by differences in spatial resolution that occur when the heart-to-detector distance changes employing noncircular orbits. To test this hypothesis, a series of planar static images of a normal cylindrical phantom was obtained at varying distances from the camera detector head. From these images, tomographic acquisition files were created that simulated tomographic data acquired with circular orbits and elliptical orbits. The reconstructed phantom short-axis slices showed no artifacts for circular orbits. However, for various elliptical orbits, significant regional nonuniformity, similar to the artifacts noted in patients, was observed. The degree of nonuniformity correlated with the long-short axis ratio of elliptical orbits (r = 0.98). In addition, circular orbits with the phantom in an eccentric position resulted in similar nonuniformities. It is concluded that a noncircular tomographic orbit can create characteristic artifacts on thallium-201 SPECT images. For rotational thallium 201 SPECT, a circular orbit with the heart in the center of rotation should be employed. \nBowel obstruction: evaluation with CT Eighty-four computed tomographic (CT) scans from patients referred for bowel obstruction between January 2, 1988, and December 31, 1989, were retrospectively evaluated. A pair of radiologists without knowledge of patient histories determined the presence or absence of bowel obstruction. Sixty-four patients ultimately proved to have intestinal obstruction, and 20 did not. Diagnosis was established by means of surgery (n = 39), barium studies (n = 17), and clinical course (n = 28). Causes of obstruction included adhesions (n = 37), metastases (n = 6), primary tumor (n = 7), Crohn disease (n = 4), hernia (n = 3), hematoma (n = 2), colonic diverticulitis (n = 2), and other (n = 3). In addition, 83 CT examinations in patients with no history or indication of intestinal obstruction were simultaneously reviewed. The overall sensitivity was 94%, specificity was 96%, and accuracy was 95%. The cause of obstruction was correctly predicted in 47 of 64 cases (73%). Intestinal obstruction was not diagnosed in any of the 83 control patients. CT is most useful in patients with a history of abdominal malignancy and in patients who have not been operated on and who have signs of infection, bowel infarction, or a palpable abdominal mass. \nPostheparin plasma diamine oxidase values in the follow up of patients with small bowel Crohn's disease. Measurement of postheparin plasma diamine oxidase (PHD) activity has been proposed to assess mucosal integrity in several diseases of the small intestine. In Crohn's disease, PHD values identify a group of patients with predominantly small bowel mucosal damage. To determine the role of mucosal involvement in the progression of small bowel Crohn's disease and whether different PHD values can predict different outcomes the changes in PHD values in 41 patients with small bowel Crohn's disease admitted consecutively to our department were investigated. The test was performed during periods of active disease and after either medical or surgical treatment had resulted in improvement. PHD values were significantly lower than in normal subjects (normal range 3.7-7.7 U/ml). In 35 patients with active disease (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) greater than 150) two groups were identified by choosing a cut off value of 2 U/ml: 93% of the 15 patients with PHD values lower than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 1.36 (0.46) U/ml) relapsed at least once in the following year, while only the 20% of the 20 whose values were higher than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 3.69 (1.50)) relapsed in the same period. The data were statistically significant (Yates's corrected chi 2 = 15.63; p less than 0.0001). The positive and negative predictive values of the test were 93% and 80%, respectively. During relapses, PHD values were consistently lower than previous values, and increased significantly after effective medical or surgical treatment. In the six patients in whom there were no changes in disease activity (CDAI persistently less than 150), there was no change in PHD values. \nThe renal growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I axis. Collecting duct is a major site of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) synthesis within kidney. Production of IGF-I at this site is stimulated by growth hormone (GH). IGF-I produced in collecting duct is likely to act on glomerulus and proximal tubule via IGF-I receptors present at these locations. Renal IGF-I may be causative of the glomerular and proximal tubular hypertrophy that occurs in hypersomatotropic states, of compensatory renal hypertrophy, and of renal regeneration following acute ischemic injury. \nThermochemotherapy in inoperable head and neck cancer. A combined hyperthermia and chemotherapy approach was used to treat five patients with locally advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck whose tumors had failed to respond to chemotherapy. In two patients, tumor had recurred after initial combined modality therapy (surgery/radiation) and had failed to respond to one course of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (cisplatin/5-FU) chemotherapy. The three remaining patients were enrolled onto a phase II evaluation of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin/fluorouracil for advanced head and neck carcinomas and had failed to achieve a partial remission after one treatment cycle. Palpable cervical tumors were heated to 40 degrees to 42 degrees C for 30 to 40 minutes, during which time cisplatin (100 mg/m2) was infused intravenously. A 5-day infusion of 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2/d) followed. Despite less than a partial response to previous cisplatin/fluorouraci",
