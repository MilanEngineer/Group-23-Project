        "text": "ife of early-stage breast cancer patients: a review. In recent years, doubt has been shed on the necessity of mastectomy for women with early-stage breast cancer. Apart from purely medical studies comparing (radical) mastectomy to less intruding surgical treatment, a number of studies (N = 18) have been published investigating the impact of breast-conserving treatment versus mastectomy on quality of life. We review these studies with respect to medical issues (treatment modality, stage of disease), methodologic issues (design, measurement moment, sample size), and results (psychologic discomfort, changes in life patterns, fears and concerns). It is concluded that there is no solid proof of a better psychologic adjustment after breast-conserving treatment and that there are no substantial differences between the different treatment modalities in changes of life patterns and fears and concerns. However, the results with respect to body image and sexual functioning favor the use of breast-conserving treatment. \nTermination of central sleep apnea episodes by upper airway stimulation using intermittent positive pressure ventilation. A 52-year-old man presented with pure central sleep apnea syndrome that failed to respond to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) therapy. Intermittent positive pressure stimulation via a nasal mask was instituted using a portable positive pressure ventilator. We found marked reduction in the respiratory disturbance index, number of desaturations, and the number of arousals with this mode of therapy. \nPrevalence of obesity in a Native Hawaiian population. Mortality data indicate that Native Hawaiians have higher death rates when compared with the US all-races population, and full-blooded Native Hawaiians are likely to have the highest mortality rates from heart disease in the nation. However, to date no comprehensive population-based study of risk factors in Native Hawaiians has been conducted. In this study of 257 Native Hawaiian adults, 62.8% of the women and 65.5% of the men were greater than or equal to 20% overweight by the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) standards. Thirty-four percent of the women and 47% of the men were severely overweight. The mean body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) was 30.3 in women and 30.9 in men. Women aged 45-54 y were heaviest with a mean BMI of 31.6. Of the men aged 25-34 y, 79.2% were overweight. The mean waist-to-hip ratio was 0.85 for women and 0.95 for men in this sample. \nMitomycin C-loaded microcapsules in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases. Pharmacokinetics of regionally administered particulate chemotherapy. Microencapsulated mitomycin C has been used for the treatment of intrahepatic tumors in Japan, but there have been no reports of its use in western countries. In this study, the pharmacokinetic profile of intrahepatic arterial mitomycin C microcapsules is reported. Regional mitomycin C was administered to six patients, both in the microencapsulated form and in solution. The clearance (140 +/- 31 1/hour, mean +/- SD) and half-life of drug in plasma (0.39 +/- 0.03 hours), and volume distribution (246 +/- 23 1) were significantly higher, and peak drug concentrations (80 +/- 75 ng/ml) significantly lower with the microencapsulated preparation than with the free drug (clearance, 46 +/- 8 1/hour; half-life, 0.11 +/- 0.02 hours; volume distribution, 33 +/- 4; peak drug concentration, 812 +/- 423 ng/ml), on Student's t testing (P less than 0.05). The results show that very little systemic exposure is associated with the microencapsulated form of mitomycin C. Dose escalation should be feasible without increasing systemic toxicity. \nExpression of glutathione S-transferase-pi messenger RNA in human esophageal cancers. The expression of human glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) in resected primary esophageal tumors and in matching normal esophageal mucosa from 25 patients undergoing radical surgery was measured by RNA blot hybridization. The RNA transcript levels of GST-pi in the tumor tissues were higher than those in normal tissues in 20 of 25 cases (80%). The mean GST-pi mRNA value in the tumor tissues (n = 25) was significantly (P less than 0.01) elevated as compared with that in background mucosa (n = 29), and in ten of 25 tumors (40%) the level of GST-pi mRNA exceeded the mean normal tissue value by two standard deviations (normal mean value + 2 X SD). The results obtained from the current experiment thus suggests that GST-pi might be a useful marker for human esophageal cancer. No correlation between GST-pi mRNA level and clinical stage or histologic characteristics was apparent. \nAdhesion formation after laparoscopic surgery in tubal pregnancy: a randomized trial versus laparotomy. OBJECTIVE: Women with ectopic pregnancy (EP) who have been operated on by laparoscopy are thought to have improved subsequent fertility, probably because of less adhesion formation. We aimed to evaluate the adhesion formation after laparoscopy as compared with laparotomy in a randomized trial. DESIGN: One hundred five patients with tubal pregnancy were stratified with regard to age and risk factors and randomized to surgery by laparoscopy or laparotomy. To evaluate adhesion formation and tubal status, 73 patients with strong desire of pregnancy underwent a second-look laparoscopy. The adhesion status at the ipsilateral and contralateral side at primary surgery was compared with the status at second-look laparoscopy. RESULTS: Patients operated on by laparotomy developed significantly more adhesions at the operated side than patients operated on by laparoscopy (P less than 0.001). Substantially more patients in the laparotomy group underwent adhesiolysis at second-look laparoscopy than did patients in the laparoscopy group. Tubal patency did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic treatment of EP results in less impairment of the pelvic status compared with conventional conservative surgery. \nExpression of intrahepatic hepatitis D viral antigen in chronic hepatitis D virus infection. To elucidate the biological importance of intrahepatic hepatitis D virus antigen, its expression was correlated with biochemical and histological inflammatory activity in 98 biopsy specimens from 68 patients seropositive for total antibody to the virus. Seventy five specimens were positive for intrahepatic nuclear antigen for HDV antigen accompanied by cytoplasmic HDV antigen in only one biopsy specimen. This group had significantly higher serum transaminase activities and inflammatory activity than the remaining cases that were negative for HDV antigen. Among the group positive for HDV antigen, there was no correlation between the proportion of hepatocytes containing HDV antigen and either serum transaminase activity or histological inflammatory indices. In 22 HDV antigen positive patients who had follow up biopsy specimens taken at a median of two years, the proportion with cirrhosis increased from 36% to 73%. Serum transaminase activities remained the same during this period, but the proportion of HDV antigen positive cells dropped. Follow up of 51 patients showed that 21 died or underwent liver transplantation within three years. The absence of an association between intrahepatic HDV antigen expression and progression of histological liver damage does not support the view that HDV is directly cytopathic to hepatocytes. Immune mediated mechanisms may have a role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease related to HDV infection. \nPatterns of mortality in sickle cell disease in the United Kingdom. Eighteen of 384 patients entered on the Brent sickle cell disease register died between 1974 and 1989, a mortality of one per 128 years of follow up. Two children died from acute splenic sequestration and a third died from fulminant pneumococcal septicaemia: none was taking prophylactic penicillin. Acute chest syndrome was the cause of death in eight young adults and one child. Three deaths occurred after surgery. Cerebrovascular accidents contributed to the cause of death in three cases and there were two sudden unexplained deaths. Ten of the deaths occurred at home or within 24 hours of admission to hospital. Post mortem examinations were made in 14 cases, but the histological appearances of acute chest syndrome were often not recognised. In most cases for whom information was available, the cause of death (chest syndrome, pneumococcal sepsis, postoperative complications) could have been prevented. \nEvidence of c-myc gene abnormalities in mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma of young adult age. Six cases of mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLCL) with sclerosis were analyzed for the presence and patterns of c-myc and bcl-2 loci rearrangements, and for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA sequences by Southern blot hybridization, c-myc gene alterations were found in three of six cases. Two cases showed the presence of mutations or small rearrangements at the 3' end of the first exon. The c-myc gene abnormalities found in these two cases are similar to those observed in the translocation 8;14 of the endemic Burkitt's lymphomas or in its variants t(2;8) and t(8;22). A third case showed a major rearrangement of c-myc gene, with truncation within its first intron, similar to those observed in sporadic Burkitt's and in acquired immunodeficiency-associated lymphomas. None of the cases displayed bcl-2 gene rearrangements or contained viral sequences. Our data suggest a possible role for a translocation-mediated c-myc activation in the pathogenesis of MLCL. Conversely, bcl-2 gene and Epstein-Barr virus do not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of these peculiar lymphomas. The association between c-myc structural modifications and MLCL also seems to be of relevance in light of the peculiar tendency of this tumor to involve unusual extranodal site (eg, kidney), reminiscent of the spreading attitude of Burkitt's limphomas. \nMortality among workers exposed to ethylene oxide. BACKGROUND. Ethylene oxide is a sterilant gas that causes leukemia and other cancers in animals. Studies in Sweden have shown an excess of leukemia and stomach cancer in humans exposed to ethylene oxide, but other studies have generally failed to confirm these findings. METHODS. We conducted a study of mortality in 18,254 U.S. workers exposed to ethylene oxide at 14 plants producing sterilized medical supplies and spices. The subjects averaged 4.9 years of exposure to the gas and 16 years of follow-up. The exposure levels in recent years averaged 4.3 ppm (eight-hour time-weighted adjusted exposure) for sterilizer operators and 2.0 ppm for other workers. The levels in earlier years are likely to have been several times higher. Mortality in this cohort was compared with that in the general U.S. population. RESULTS. Overall there was no significant increase in mortality from any cause in the study cohort. The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were 0.97 for leukemia (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.67; 13 deaths observed), 1.06 for all hematopoietic cancers (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.47; 36 deaths), and 0.94 for stomach cancer (95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.70; 11 deaths). Analyses according to job category and according to the duration of exposure showed no excess in cancers, as compared with the rate in the general population, but there was a significant trend toward increased mortality with increasing lengths of time since the first exposure for all hematopoietic cancers. The rate of death from hematopoietic cancer (especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was significantly increased among men (SMR, 1.55; 27 deaths). Mortality from leukemia in recent years (1985 through 1987) was significantly increased among men (SMR, 3.45; 5 deaths). CONCLUSIONS. For the entire cohort, there was no increase in mortality from hematopoietic cancer. There was a slight but significant increase among men, however. Among men and women combined, there was a trend toward an increased risk of death from hematopoietic cancer with increasing lengths of time since the first exposure to ethylene oxide. \nPropranolol ameliorates the development of portal-systemic shunting in a chronic murine schistosomiasis model of portal hypertension. We investigated the role of early portal hypotensive pharmacotherapy in preventing the development of portal-systemic shunting in a portal hypertensive model of chronic murine schistosomiasis induced by infecting C3H mice with 60 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. Propranolol was administered in drinking water to 20 animals for a period of 6 wk at a dose of 10 mg.kg-1d-1, starting at 5 wk of schistosomal infection. 32 age-matched mice with chronic schistosomal infection served as controls. All animals were studied 11 wk after the infection. Compared with controls the portal pressure (10.8 +/- 0.40 mmHg) was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) in the propranolol-treated animals (7.9 +/- 0.80 mmHg). Portal-systemic shunting was decreased by 79%, from 12.2 +/- 3.34% in controls to 2.5 +/- 0.99% in the propranolol group (P less than 0.05). Portal venous inflow was reduced by 38% in the propranolol treated animals (2.50 +/- 0.73 ml/min; n = 6) compared with controls (4.00 +/- 0.34 ml/min; n = 8; P less than 0.05). The worm burden, the granulomatous reaction, the collagen content of the liver, and the serum bile acid levels were not significantly different between the two groups of animals. These results demonstrate that in chronic liver disease induced by schistosomiasis, the development of portal-systemic shunting can be decreased or prevented by the reduction of flow and pressure in the portal system. \nArrhythmogenic effects of graded coronary blood flow reductions superimposed on prior myocardial infarction in dogs. BACKGROUND. We studied arrhythmogenesis and its underlying pathophysiology during graded reductions of coronary blood flow, superimposed on prior myocardial infarction to test the hypothesis that spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and induced ventricular tachycardia are dependent on different patterns of coronary flow reduction in hearts with prior myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 10 sham-operated dogs (control group) and 24 dogs with 3-week-old experimental apical myocardial infarction, the left circumflex coronary artery was constricted to produce four grades of flow reduction: 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Among the sham-operated control animals, only one of 10 (10%) developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and only two of nine (22%) were inducible into sustained ventricular tachycardia during 100% circumflex coronary artery flow reduction. No spontaneous ventricular fibrillation or inducible ventricular tachycardia occurred with lesser grades (25%, 50%, or 75%) of flow reduction among the control animals. In the myocardial infarction group, five of 24 dogs (21%) were inducible before flow reduction. However, 50% flow reduction in the myocardial infarction group resulted in inducibility of ventricular tachycardia in 12 of 24 dogs (50%); nine of 16 (56%) during 75% flow reduction; and six of 11 (55%) with 100% flow reduction. In addition, none of the dogs in the myocardial infarction group developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during 25% or 50% flow reduction, whereas six of 22 (27%) developed ventricular fibrillation during 75% flow reduction and 10 of 21 (48%) during 100% flow reduction. In dogs with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during flow reduction, the total myocardial mass of the ischemic \"risk\" zone and infarcted zone was significantly greater than in those without spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (68 +/- 5% versus 56 +/- 6% [p less than 0.01]). There was no difference in the total myocardial mass of the ischemic risk zone and infarcted zone between dogs with and without inducible ventricular tachycardia during flow reduction. CONCLUSIONS. In canine model of subacute myocardial infarction, superimposed ischemia increased the likelihood of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia with lesser grades of coronary flow reduction compared with that necessary to allow spontaneous ventricular fibrillation. The underlying pathophysiology appears to differ between spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and electrically induced sustained ventricular tachycardia. \nPrevention of bacterial infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. A randomized, multicenter trial comparing norfloxacin with ciprofloxacin. The GIMEMA Infection Program. Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in preventing bacterial infection in neutropenic patients. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: Twenty-one hematologic units in tertiary care or university hospitals. PATIENTS: Eight hundred and one consecutive, afebrile, adult patients who had hematologic malignancies or who had bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (neutrophil count, less than 1000/mm3) expected to last more than 10 days. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally every 12 hours norfloxacin, 400 mg, or ciprofloxacin, 500 mg. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy analysis was done for 619 patients: 319 treated with norfloxacin and 300 treated with ciprofloxacin. MAIN RESULTS: More patients receiving ciprofloxacin did not develop fever during neutropenia and did not receive antibiotics (34%) compared with those receiving norfloxacin (25%) (P = 0.01). Patients receiving ciprofloxacin had a lower rate of microbiologically documented infection (17% compared with 24%; P = 0.058), particularly of infection from gram-negative bacilli (4% compared with 9%; P = 0.03). The interval to the first febrile episode was also longer in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (8.3 compared with 7.2 days; P = 0.055). The rates of clinically documented infection, fever of unknown origin, and mortality as well as compliance and tolerability were similar in the two groups. Patients who had neutropenia for less than 15 days, who had severe neutropenia for less than 7 days, and who received antifungal prophylaxis benefited most from ciprofloxacin therapy. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin should be used to prevent the development of infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. \nAdjuvant whole-abdominal radiation therapy in uterine papillary serous carcinoma. Nine patients from 34 to 74 years of age (median, 67 years of age) with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) were treated with whole-abdominal radiation therapy (WART) on an adjuvant basis after cytoreductive surgery. All patients were treated with megavoltage photons to an abdominopelvic field to a median dose of 2500 cGy, with continued treatment to a whole pelvic field to a median dose of 4500 cGy. Three patients received additional boost to the vaginal apex. Follow-up time ranged from 6 to 31 months (median, 25 months) after completion of WART. Six patients had recurrent disease at 5 to 20 months (median, 7.5 months). Four of these patients died of their disease during the follow-up period. Three of six patients in whom treatment failed had disease at the vaginal apex. None of these patients received boost radiation therapy to that site. In contrast, two of three patients remaining disease free were treated with additional vaginal apex irradiation. Based on these results, the authors do not routinely recommend WART for adjuvant treatment of UPSC. They do, however, recommend vaginal apex irradiation for these patients. \nIncreased plasma endothelin-1 in the early hours of acute myocardial infarction. Endothelin is a novel endothelium-derived vasoactive peptide with potent vasoconstrictor action in the coronary bed; however, its possible contribution to myocardial ischemia and infarction is not known. Plasma endothelin-1 concentration was measured with use of a radioimmunoassay in serial venous samples from 22 patients over a 72 h period after acute myocardial infarction (14 patients with uncomplicated infarction [group I] and 8 patients with hemodynamic or ischemic sequelae [group II]). Twenty-two normal subjects and seven patients with stable angina served as the control subjects. Endothelin-1 levels in patients with stable coronary disease were not different from those of normal subjects (0.62 +/- 0.56 and 0.76 +/- 0.38 pg/ml, respectively). In group I, plasma levels of endothelin-1 rose sharply after myocardial infarction, reaching a peak of 4.95 +/- 0.78 pg/ml at 6 h after the onset of chest pain (p less than 0.05 compared with values in control subjects) and returning rapidly toward the normal range by 24 h. Patients with complicated infarction (group II) demonstrated a similar rapid increase in plasma endothelin-1 to a peak value of 8.29 +/- 1.95 pg/ml; however, plasma endothelin-1 remained elevated in these patients, becoming significantly different from values in group I at 48 and 72 h. There was no correlation between peak increases in creatine kinase and peak endothelin-1 in either group, suggesting that the stimulus for elevation of endothelin-1 was not myocardial necrosis itself. Furthermore, left ventricular ejection fraction did not correlate with the increase in endothelin-1 in group I patients, whereas there was a significant inverse relation between ventricular function and plasma endothelin-1 in group II. \nLegionella myositis. Neuromuscular involvement in patients with legionnaires' disease is common, with serum CK elevations in up to 78% of patients. A few cases have been associated with neuropathy. The mechanism of injury to the neuromuscular system is unknown, but organisms have not previously been found in nerve or muscle. We report the clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic findings in a patient with Legionella myositis and motor neuropathy, the first case to demonstrate direct muscle invasion by the Legionella organism. \nLichen planus and mesalazine. Lichen planus is a recognized complication of sulfasalazine therapy. Two patients developed typical oral and cutaneous lichen planus on sulfasalazine and their skin lesions recurred when they were subsequently changed to mesalazine. Lichen planus only resolved on withdrawal of both drugs. It seems likely that the aminosalicylic acid moiety is responsible for this reaction and that lichen planus is a true complication of mesalazine therapy. \nPlantar fasciitis. Etiology, treatment, surgical results, and review of the literature. Plantar fasciitis is a common orthopedic syndrome among athletes and nonathletes. The etiology of the pain is multifactorial but usually involves inflammation and degeneration of the plantar fascia origin. The majority of patients will respond to conservative measures. Surgical treatment is reserved for those patients who do not respond. A complete plantar fascia release is performed through a medial longitudinal incision. Prominent heel spurs and degenerated areas in the plantar fascia are resected. Of 27 surgically treated cases followed from one to three years, satisfactory results were obtained in 24 cases. Histologically, localized fibrosis or granulomatous changes or both were noted in several cases. \nCreatine kinase isoenzyme band mimicking CK MB on agarose gel electrophoresis. The authors report the case of an 80-year-old man with prostatic disease whose serum contained an aberrant band in the MB position on agarose gel electrophoresis of creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes. The authors demonstrated that the band probably was CK BB; the patient had no evidence of myocardial infarction. Contrary to most previous reports of such cases, the aberrant enzyme did not appear to be linked with IgG, IgA, or IgM; it also did not behave as if attached to a chelatable cation. Care must be taken to avoid mistaking such bands for CK MB. \nDoes cigarette smoking have an independent effect on coronary heart disease incidence in the elderly? In order to evaluate the effects of cigarette smoking on coronary heart disease (CHD) in elderly persons in the Honolulu Heart Program, 1,394 men between ages 65 and 74 were followed during an average 12-year period for new cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. Incidence rates increased progressively in individuals classified at baseline as never, former, and current smokers, respectively. The absolute excess risk associated with cigarette smoking was nearly twice as high in elderly compared with middle-aged men. \nMuscle mitochondrial DNA in encephalomyopathy and ragged red fibres: a Southern blot analysis and literature review. Various mitochondrial DNA abnormalities have been described in patients with encephalomyopathies. We performed Southern blot analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA in nine adult patients with clinical features and ragged red fibres suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Two patients with encephalomyopathy and two with the MERRF syndrome (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibres) had the normal PvuII restriction pattern of muscle mitochondrial DNA. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA deletion was observed in two of six patients with ophthalmoplegia. One suffered from typical Kearns-Sayre syndrome and the other from isolated external ophthalmoplegia. None of these patients had affected relatives. The detection of mitochondrial DNA deletion in external ophthalmoplegia and their site and size support previously reported data. \nAcute positive inotropic intervention: the phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors that are selective for cAMP-specific cardiac and vascular PDE III comprise a new group of agents for the treatment of heart failure, which at present are limited to clinical shortterm intravenous use and research uses only. Although both intravenous amrinone and milrinone are FDA approved, only amrinone is available for general clinical use. Selective phosphodiesterase inhibition produces beneficial actions of positive inotropy and peripheral vasodilation that result from increased cardiac and vascular muscle concentrations of intracellular cAMP and ionic calcium. In addition, a positive lusitropic action (enhancement of cardiac relaxation) has been observed. Neither beta-adrenergic agonist activity nor inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase is produced by these agents. The magnitude of hemodynamic improvement generally exceeds that of the cardiac glycosides and is comparable with that of intravenous catecholamines such as dobutamine. The different pharmacodynamic profile of the PDE inhibitors is additive to the effects of cardiac glycosides, complementary and synergistic to the actions of catecholamines, and has been shown to have favorable effects on coronary hemodynamics. As a result there is continued enthusiasm for the short-term intravenous use of amrinone and potentially milrinone in the setting of acute heart failure resulting from systolic dysfunction (after myocardial infarction, open heart surgery, or infectious or toxic myocarditis), heart failure resulting from right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and when patients with severe heart failure await cardiac transplantation. Initiation of treatment with an intravenous bolus followed by a maintenance infusion provides prompt increases in stroke volume and cardiac output and simultaneous reductions in right and left ventricular filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance. \nConsequences of the nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl [published erratum appears in Public Health Rep 1991 May-Jun;106(3):352] The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident, in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), on April 26, 1986, was the first major nuclear power plant accident that resulted in a large-scale fire and subsequent explosions, immediate and delayed deaths of plant operators and emergency service workers, and the radioactive contamination of a significant land area. The release of radioactive material, over a 10-day period, resulted in millions of Soviets, and other Europeans, being exposed to measurable levels of radioactive fallout. Because of the effects of wind and rain, the radioactive nuclide fallout distribution patterns are not well defined, though they appear to be focused in three contiguous Soviet Republics: the Ukrainian SSR, the Byelorussian SSR, and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. Further, because of the many radioactive nuclides (krypton, xenon, cesium, iodine, strontium, plutonium) released by the prolonged fires at Chernobyl, the long-term medical, psychological, social, and economic effects will require careful and prolonged study. Specifically, studies on the medical (leukemia, cancers, thyroid disease) and psychological (reactive depressions, post-traumatic stress disorders, family disorganization) consequences of continued low dose radiation exposure in the affected villages and towns need to be conducted so that a coherent, comprehensive, community-oriented plan may evolve that will not cause those already affected any additional harm and confusion. \nSpontaneous near disappearance of bilateral coronary artery-pulmonary artery fistulas. Although coronary artery fistula is a relatively rare anomaly, it sometimes develops with advancing age, requiring surgical removal. We report a unique case of a patient whose bilateral coronary artery-pulmonary artery fistulas nearly disappeared in the course of four years. This case is interesting in view of recognizing one of the natural courses of this entity. \nCerebral blood flow changes in migraine: methods, observations and hypotheses. A number of basically different methods have been used in studies of the cerebrovascular changes which occur in migraine and each individual set of findings seems to be dependent on which method is used. One method on its own can only disclose a part of all the pathophysiological events. This review is an attempt to consider the capabilities of each method and to bring together the results from different studies on migraine in order to create a complete picture of the cerebrovascular changes which occur during the course of a migraine attack. \nPulmonary oedema after airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis. We report a case of pulmonary oedema which developed after airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis. The patient was a 52-yr-old woman undergoing craniotomy for an acoustic neuroma. Anaesthesia was uneventful. Spontaneous ventilation resumed after reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Following extubation she showed signs of airway obstruction and dyspnoea. The trachea was reintubated but she became hypoxic, PaO2-36 mmHg, produced pink frothy secretions and the x-ray was typical of pulmonary oedema. The oedema cleared within 24 hr. Tracheostomy was performed one week later as the cords were still fixed, but the latter had recovered by three months and the tracheostomy was closed. The cause of the cord paralysis is unknown but probably was a result of surgical trauma to the brain stem. \nProgression of coronary atherosclerosis: is coronary spasm related to progression? A total of 239 patients undergoing serial coronary angiography with a concomitant ergonovine provocation test were studied between July 1974 and June 1987. The progression of coronary artery disease was evaluated in relation to risk factors, especially coronary artery spasm. Patients were classified into three groups: 1) new myocardial infarction group (39 patients); 2) progression without infarction group (90 patients); and 3) nonprogression group (110 patients). To assess how risk factors and coronary spasm are related to the occurrence of new myocardial infarction and progression without infarction, 11 variables in the three groups were examined: age, gender, the time interval between the studies, fasting blood sugar, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, smoking, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test. Multiple regression analysis selected three independent predictors of progression without infarction: cholesterol (p less than 0.01), systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test (p less than 0.001). Multiple regression analysis also selected three independent predictors of the occurrence of new myocardial infarction: fasting blood sugar (p less than 0.01), systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test (p less than 0.001). A positive response to the ergonovine provocation test was the strongest factor for occurrence of both new myocardial infarction and progression without infarction. To evaluate segmental arterial changes, 3,275 coronary artery segments were analyzed in the 239 patients. \nReductions in cirrhosis deaths in the United States: associations with per capita consumption and AA membership. Cirrhosis mortality and morbidity rates have declined in many jurisdictions, including the U.S., in recent years. Previous research in Canada and Europe suggests that these declines are linked to changes in per capita consumption of alcohol and changes in the availability and/or utilization of services to reduce abusive drinking (e.g., treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous). In this study, changes in cirrhosis death rates in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia between 1974 and 1983 were regressed onto changes in per capita consumption (1974-83). AA membership (1974-83) and alcoholism treatment (1979-82). No significant relationship between treatment and cirrhosis changes was observed; however, the measure of change in treatment may not reflect the full extent of changes that occurred in the 1974-83 period. As predicted, decreases in per capita consumption and increases in AA membership were significantly associated with decreases in cirrhosis rates. \nSevere, symptomatic, dose-limiting hypophosphatemia induced by hepatic arterial infusion of recombinant tumor necrosis factor in patients with liver metastases. Twenty-two patients with liver metastases received 45 courses of recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) by hepatic arterial infusion in doses ranging from 12.5 to 175 micrograms/m2/d for 5 days by continuous infusion. The induction of statistically significant, dose-related, severe, albeit transient, hypophosphatemia (less than 1.0 mg/dl) associated with clinically significant, right-sided myocardial dysfunction and severe lassitude was observed. These side effects were promptly reversed after rTNF was stopped and intravenous phosphate supplementation was started. As no significant or consistent increase in urinary phosphate excretion was detected, the rTNF-induced hypophosphatemia probably resulted from an intracellular shift of phosphate. Since tumor regression was clearly associated with the lowest levels of serum phosphate, hypophosphatemia may be important in the antitumor effects of rTNF. \nPsammomatous melanotic schwannoma: an additional component of Carney's complex. Report of a case. The authors report a case of Carney's complex (the complex of myxomas, spotty pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity) in a 32-year-old white man. Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma has recently been included as a component of this disorder. The complex was recognized after a psammomatous melanotic schwannoma was resected from the sacral canal. Subsequent echocardiography revealed ventricular cardiac myxomata. Resection of these lesions was successfully performed. Review of previous history and pathologic material further supported the diagnosis. The authors conclude that recognition of each component as part of the syndrome is of crucial importance, because it may prevent a fatal outcome. A family screening program should be performed in each case. \nLower-extremity vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease: prospective evaluation with duplex Doppler sonography. Eighty-five men with 92 vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity underwent a total of 264 examinations with duplex Doppler over a 2.5-year period. In 64 patients who underwent more than one examination, the total follow-up encompassed 740 months. In 220 native femoral arteries (96.0%) the peak systolic velocity (PSV) was higher than that in the graft. Arteriovenous shunting was associated with a normal PSV and a markedly elevated diastolic component at spectral analysis. Focal fluid collections were common initially near the graft and usually disappeared uneventfully. An average PSV of 32 cm/sec or less was always associated with impending occlusion. The sensitivity of an average PSV of 40 cm/sec or less to indicate impending graft occlusion by the next visit was only 33%; the specificity, 94%. At initial examination, stenoses were associated with high PSV focally in the graft or low PSV with absent diastolic flow. \nUlcerative colitis in the autotransplanted neovagina. A 33-year-old woman had undergone a radical surgical excision for carcinoma of the vagina at age 11. Vaginal reconstruction using a pedicled transplant of the sigmoid colon was successfully accomplished at age 19. Fourteen years later she developed vaginal bleeding, and a biopsy of the neovagina revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Within 2 weeks the patient developed bleeding per ano, and a rectal biopsy also revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Symptoms responded to sulfasalazine. This is believed to be the first case report of ulcerative colitis developing in colonic tissue used for a neovagina. The etiology, natural history, and surveillance of ulcerative colitis in relation to this unique case are reviewed. This case argues against the hypothesis that chronic ulcerative colitis is causally related to direct exposure to alimentary antigens. \nEffect of interferon administration on serum hepatitis C virus RNA in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus RNA as detected by reverse transcription and nested polymerase chain reaction was monitored in 16 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon. Hepatitis C virus RNA became undetectable after 4 to 8 wk of interferon administration in 13 of the 16 patients. During 6 mo of follow-up, 5 of the 13 patients who became negative for hepatitis C virus RNA after interferon administration remained negative, and all five continued to have normal ALT levels. Repeat liver biopsy in these five patients revealed histological improvement. Antibody to hepatitis C virus, which was initially positive in all treated patients, fell to undetectable levels in three of the five patients. In contrast, aminotransferase levels rose again in all eight patients who had become hepatitis C virus RNA negative but had again exhibited hepatitis C virus RNA after completion of therapy. In 16 untreated patients, hepatitis C virus RNA remained detectable. These results indicate that detection of hepatitis C virus RNA may be useful as a marker of viral replication in chronic hepatitis C; they also suggest that interferon should again be administered to patients who become hepatitis C virus RNA negative on treatment but again exhibit this marker of viral replication when treatment is stopped. \nPartial hypoparathyroidism. A variant of transient congenital hypoparathyroidism. We encountered three children who had neonatal hypocalcemia followed by a period of normocalcemia and recurrence of hypocalcemia later in childhood. They were full-term infants with normal birth weights who developed hypocalcemia within the first 48 hours after birth. The hypocalcemia resolved in 1 week, 3 months, and 14 months in the three patients. The recurrences of hypocalcemia occurred at 4, 7, and 12 years of age. Their plasma parathyroid hormone concentrations were consistently low but detectable. We suggest that partial hypoparathyroidism is the underlying abnormality in these patients and that neonatal hypocalcemia in otherwise healthy infants indicates the need for calcium measurements during childhood and adolescence. \nComparison of the aortic homograft and the pulmonary autograft for aortic valve or root replacement in children. To assess late results of aortic homograft and pulmonary autograft valves implanted into the left ventricular outflow tract of children, we reviewed the case histories of 146 patients 18 years of age or younger who underwent aortic valve or root replacement between November 1964 and April 1990. One hundred three patients (mean, 12 +/- 3.9 years) received an aortic homograft and 43 (mean, 14 +/- 4.1 years) had their own pulmonary valve transferred to the aortic position. There were 54 valve and 49 root replacements with homografts and 36 valve and seven root replacements with autografts. Hospital mortality rate was 15.5% (16 patients) in the homograft group and 11.6% (five patients) in the autograft group. Survivors were followed up for a total of 867 (homograft) and 297 (autograft) patient-years. The late mortality rate was 16.7% (1.9% per patient-year) for patients with homografts and 13.2% (4.4% per patient-year) for patients with autografts, whereas the incidence for reoperation per patient-year was 2.9% and 2.0%, respectively. At 15 years actuarial rates for homografts and autografts for freedom from reoperation were 54% +/- 8.1% and 68% +/- 11.1%; freedom from endocarditis, 97% +/- 2.4% and 75% +/- 10.2%; and freedom from any complication, 41% +/- 6.5% and 50% +/- 10.3%. Valve degeneration occurred in 19 homografts (2.2% per patient-year), whereas there was no definite instance of primary tissue failure among the pulmonary autografts. This experience would indicate that either the homograft or the autograft valve can be used with acceptable results in children. However, the pulmonary autograft gives better long-term performance and, if growth potential is realized, may be the ideal valve substitute in children. \nThe relationship of sodium balance and concomitant diuretic therapy to blood pressure response with calcium channel entry blockers. Marked heterogeneity exists in the response of blood pressure to specific antihypertensive agents. In general, a single therapeutic agent can be expected to provide an adequate blood pressure response in 40% to 60% of hypertensive patients. The addition of a second agent usually extends the response rate to over 85%. The addition of a diuretic to nondiuretic regimens often produces an additive blood pressure-lowering effect. However, calcium channel entry blockers (CCBs) may be an exception, as diuretics do not appear to improve these agents' efficacy. CCBs have a dual mechanism for blood pressure reduction. In addition to their vasodilatory actions, they also promote diuresis and natriuresis. These features account for the striking efficacy of these agents when used as monotherapy in hypertensive patients. Studies have shown that dietary sodium restriction does not appear to improve the efficacy of CCBs, nor is a high-salt diet predictive of a better therapeutic outcome. Recent studies also indicate that the addition of a diuretic to a CCB does not produce a significant or consistent additive antihypertensive effect. Because CCBs do not produce the typical responses of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system to sodium/volume depletion, their diuretic and natriuretic effects do not result in the same adverse metabolic consequences as experienced with traditional diuretic therapy. \nFibrin fragment D-dimer and fibrinogen B beta peptides in plasma as markers of clot lysis during thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The validity of markers in plasma of in vitro thrombolysis was investigated in 12 patients with extensive fibrinogen breakdown (greater than 80%, group 1) and in 12 patients with minimal breakdown (less than 20%, group 2). The patients were treated with 100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in the \"Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction II\" (TIMI II) trial. Cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels were measured with two variant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), both using a fibrin fragment D-dimer specific capture antibody. In one instance, a tag antibody was used that cross-reacts with fibrinogen (pan-specific tag ELISA); in the other, the tag antibody was specific for fibrin fragment D (fibrin-specific tag ELISA). Apparent concentrations of cross-linked fibrin degradation products at baseline were within normal limits with both assays in most patients. At 8 hours after rt-PA infusion, the measured cross-linked fibrin degradation products were increased about twofold to fourfold in group 2 with both assays. However, in group 1, levels were significantly higher with the pan-specific tag ELISA (5.8 +/- 4.2 micrograms/mL) compared with the fibrin-specific tag ELISA (1.5 +/- 1.3 micrograms/mL). This observation was most likely a result of detection of fibrinogen degradation products in the pan-specific ELISA. Apparent levels of fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42, a marker of fragment X formation, increased during thrombolysis from 4.2 +/- 2.8 pmol/mL to 2,000 +/- 230 pmol/mL in group 1 and from 4.1 +/- 2.1 pmol/mL to 300 +/- 43 pmol/mL in group 2, and were correlated significantly with the extent of fibrinogen breakdown (r = -0.8). Fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 levels increased from 4.3 +/- 3 pmol/mL to 70 +/- 19 pmol/mL in group 1, but did not increase in group 2. The apparent increase in group 1 could be explained by cross-reactivity of fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42 in the fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 assay. We conclude that cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels as measured with a pan-specific tag ELISA and fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 levels as measured with certain monoclonal antibody-based ELISA are influenced by the extent of fibrinogen degradation. Fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42 is a marker specific for fibrinogen breakdown. Cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels, measured with a fibrin-specific tag ELISA, appear to be markers specific for thrombolysis. Consequently, assays similar to the fibrin-specific tag ELISA may provide more accurate information when correlated with clinical endpoints. \nManagement of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma. The surgical management of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma remains controversial. Forty cases (41 ears) of labyrinthine fistulas were reviewed. This represented 10% of our total series of cholesteatomas in adults and children (426 ears). Clinical presentation, extent of disease, results of fistula testing and audiometric studies, and radiographic findings were analyzed. A canal wall-down procedure was performed in all but one patient. Generally an attempt was made to completely remove the cholesteatoma, to graft the fistulous area, and to reconstruct the middle ear mechanism in one stage. The matrix was preserved in patients with large fistulas where the involved ear was the only hearing one, when the matrix was adherent to the underlying optic duct, and in selected elderly persons. Long-term followup did not reveal a significant difference in hearing, degree of vertigo, or incidence of recidivism when those patients in whom the matrix was removed were compared with those in whom the matrix was preserved. The importance of recognizing the presence of a labyrinthine fistula preoperatively is stressed, along with the need to be prepared for an unexpected fistula. Operative management is described. \nCatecholaminergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus of normal individuals and patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The parabrachial nucleus is believed to play a role in autonomic regulation. We have used the Fontana-Masson ammoniacal silver nitrate method and a tyrosine hydroxylase-immunostaining technique to demonstrate the presence of neuromelanin-containing catecholaminergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus of normal individuals. In addition, we also show that there is a significant reduction of these catecholaminergic neurons and presence of Lewy bodies in the parabrachial nucleus of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. These findings may be related to the several autonomic disturbances that may occur in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. \nA loading dose/continuous infusion schedule of fludarabine phosphate in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Using a loading dose/continuous infusion schedule, fludarabine phosphate was administered to 51 patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). All patients had evidence of active disease, and the majority had advanced Rai stages. Of the 42 patients assessable for response, 22 (52%) achieved a partial response, five (12%) had stable disease, and 15 (36%) progressed. Thirteen of the 22 responders improved their Rai stages with fludarabine therapy, including six patients who achieved stage 0. Response rates for pretreatment stages III and IV were 60% and 53%, respectively. Patients with final Rai stages 0 to II had better survival than those with stages III and IV. Patients who had undergone splenectomy before starting therapy were more likely to respond. Myelosuppression was the primary toxicity and did not appear to be cumulative. Severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, although infrequent, were associated with several deaths in the early cycles of treatment. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild with no serious neurotoxicity noted. Infections were common with 22 minor, 18 major, and 10 fatal episodes. Fludarabine phosphate by this alternative dosing schedule is effective in refractory advanced CLL and is well tolerated by the majority of patients. \nResponse to tumor necrosis factor in two cases of psoriasis. A 70-year-old woman was treated for renal cell carcinoma with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor, 450,000 U/m2 of body surface area, daily for 5 days, once a month. She had had psoriasis for 25 years. After two courses of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor her psoriasis resolved. A 40-year-old man with severe psoriasis was subsequently treated with a total of seven complete and incomplete 5-day courses of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor at doses of 50,000 to 300,000 U/m2/day. Significant toxicity (fever, chills, hypertension, and hypotension) was encountered. Partial resolution of the lesions was seen. Tumor necrosis factor is an active agent in psoriasis. \nProstaglandin F2 alpha and indomethacin in hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia. Effects on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange. We treated a 68-year-old man with cirrhosis of the liver associated with moderate hypoxemia. Contrast-enhanced echocardiography revealed late opacification of the left ventricle, and pulmonary perfusion imaging with 99mTc macroaggregated albumin showed evidence of a significant uptake in both lungs and in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Right cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary hypotension, low pulmonary vascular resistance, and high cardiac output. We administered prostaglandin F2 alpha intravenously (0.2 microgram/kg/min for 30 minutes) and indomethacin orally (75 mg/day for three days). There was some degree of resolution of the hypoxemia and increases in both pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia is a reversible intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. These conditions can to some extent be modulated by vasoactive substances such as prostaglandins or other eicosanoids. \nThe effects of adenotonsillectomy on growth in young children. A history of poor weight gain can often be elicited in young children with chronic upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. A series of 41 consecutive children under 3 years of age, who underwent inpatient adenotonsillectomy, were reviewed for changes in weight and height. Thirty-seven patients had adequate long-term follow-up. Of these, many had dramatic improvements in growth after adenotonsillectomy. Indications for surgery in this group were recurrent infection in three patients (7%), unilateral tonsillar mass in one patient (3%), and upper airway obstruction in 37 patients (90%). A clear history of sleep apnea was elicited in 59%. At the time of surgery, 19 of 41 patients (46%) were of the fifth percentile or lower for age-corrected weight. The inpatient hospital stay averaged 3.2 days. The postoperative complication rate was 27%, with postoperative stridor as the most common complication. After surgery, 28 children (75%) showed a change to a higher percentile for weight. Twenty-four (65%) had percentile changes of 15% or more. This change is significant according to results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p less than 0.001). We conclude that a relationship exists between improved growth rate and adenotonsillectomy in our study group. The rapid improvement in growth appears to be most obvious in children with upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Upper airway obstruction (including andenotonsillar hypertrophy) should be suspected as a possible cause in the workup of children with suboptimum growth. \nOral almitrine in treatment of acute respiratory failure and cor pulmonale in patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease. The effects of oral almitrine bismesylate, a respiratory stimulant that acts on peripheral arterial chemoreceptors, was studied in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease and hypoxaemic cor pulmonale. Twenty three patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of ventilatory failure were randomised to receive either almitrine 100 mg twice a day reducing to 50 mg twice a day over 48 hours or placebo in addition to conventional treatment. On admission the mean (SE) values for blood gas tensions were PaO2 4.8 (0.3) and PaCO2 7.7 (0.3) kPa in the 12 patients who received almitrine and PaO2 4.9 (0.1) and PaCO2 7.6 (0.3) kPa in the 11 who received placebo. After three hours of oxygen therapy at 1 1/min there was a similar rise in PaO2 in both groups, 6.4 (0.2) kPa in those receiving almitrine and 6.6 (0.4) kPa in those receiving placebo. After 24 hours of oxygen therapy values of PaO2 were again similar at 6.3 (0.8) kPa and 6.7 (2.2) kPa respectively. Arterial blood gas tensions improved during the study in those who survived but no significant differences were apparent between the two groups. There were six deaths, five in the almitrine group and one in the placebo group. There were no differences between the groups in respiratory rate, results of spirometry, oxygen requirement, or degree of dyspnoea (on visual analogue scale). The results did not show any benefit from oral almitrine in patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to chronic obstructive airways disease. Plasma almitrine concentrations, however, were often below the optimum therapeutic range, suggesting impaired drug absorption. \nMedication-induced esophageal injury: report of 17 cases with endoscopic documentation. We report on medication-induced esophageal injury (MIEI) in 17 patients (six male, 11 female) seen from October 1986 to May 1990. The mean age of patients was 27.3 (SD = 5.7) yr; mean duration of drug ingestion prior to the occurrence of symptoms 10.2 (SD = 11.5) days, and mean duration of symptoms before seeking medical attention 4.6 (SD = 3.8) days. Symptoms subsided after treatment, with a mean of 6 (SD = 2.5) days. Symptoms included odynophagia (in 17), chest pain (six), epigastric pain (three), and retrosternal pain (one). Symptoms occurred after the drug was stopped in three. MIEI was caused by doxycycline (seven), minocycline (five), Pantozyme (one), cloxacillin (one), unknown (two), and dicloxacillin + Danzen (one). Reclining after drug ingestion was the predominant risk factor. Endoscopy showed most ulcers to be multiple and at midesophagus. Barium swallows done in two patients were negative. There is no previous report of Pantozyme (pancreatic enzyme), Danzen (serratio-peptidase), cloxacillin, and dicloxacillin causing MIEI. \nDeveloping a dysphagia program in an acute care hospital: a needs assessment. A needs assessment for a hospital-based dysphagia program was conducted to determine incidence, management procedures, and outcome for stroke patients with swallowing disorders. Using a chart review of 225 patients, it was found that 28% had documented evidence of dysphagia. When dysphagia co-occurred with stroke, significantly more functional problems and medical complications were reported, as well as increased need for dietary modifications and alternative feeding methods. The dysphagic patients were more often aphasic and dysarthric and less able to communicate. Mental status was more likely to be reduced and the need for staff supervision during mealtime was increased. Dysphagic patients had significantly longer hospital stays, thus increasing the cost of their care. At discharge, almost half of them continued to need feeding modifications, which may have delayed rehabilitation or transfer to facilities with other levels of care. The dysphagia group clearly displayed a wide range of clinical symptoms that would alert staff to their risk for medical complications because of swallowing problems. We believe that this needs assessment clearly showed that a multidisciplinary dysphagia management program has the potential to enhance patient care while decreasing the cost of health care delivery for the hospital. \nHuman interleukin-9: genomic sequence, chromosomal location, and sequences essential for its expression in human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I-transformed human T cells. We have isolated the genomic sequence of human interleukin-9 (IL-9) based on its sequence homology with a human IL-9 cDNA isolated from human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I-transformed T cells by expression cloning. The entire genomic sequence has been determined and the gene consists of five exons and four introns. The human IL-9 gene is mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 5 at band 5q31-32, a region found to be deleted in a number of patients with acquired 5q- abnormalities and hematologic disorders. Several blocks of transcriptional control sequences have been identified at the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-9 gene that may play an important role in the control of IL-9 gene expression. The 5'-regulatory region of the human IL-9 gene also contains sequences identified in the 5'-flanking regions of other cytokine genes mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 5, including IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and other T-cell growth factor genes including IL-2 and IL-6. The IL-9 gene is constitutively expressed in the HTLV-I-transformed human T cells and the expression of IL-9 in these cells can be further induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate. Transient transfection analysis using the plasmid containing the 5'-flanking region of IL-9 gene upstream from the firefly luciferase ciferase report gene indicated that the 0.9-kb Smal-Sacl fragment of the IL-9 gene contains sequences required for the constitutive and activated expression of IL-9 gene in HTLV-I-transformed cells. These results will now allow us to study the regulatory mechanism of IL-9 gene expression in normal and leukemic human T cells. \nRandomized controlled trial of prophylactic rifampin for peritoneal dialysis-related infections. Staphylococcal infections are a major cause of catheter infections and peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Since catheter-related infections are associated with nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in this population, we studied the effect of intermittent rifampin, an antibiotic known to decrease S aureus nasal carriage, on catheter-related infections and peritonitis. We randomly assigned 64 patients to receive either rifampin 300 mg twice daily for 5 days every 3 months or no treatment. The rifampin-treated patients had a significant delay in time to first catheter-related infection (P less than 0.015) and significantly fewer catheter-related infections overall (P less than 0.001). The catheter-related infection rate in rifampin-treated patients was .26 per patient-year versus .93 per patient-year in untreated patients. Multivariate analysis defined baseline colonization of nares or catheter exit-site and prior renal transplant as risk factors for catheter-related infections. There was no significant difference in peritonitis rates between groups, although the trend was for a delayed time to first episodes and fewer episodes in rifampin-treated patients. Adverse effects necessitated withdrawal of rifampin in four patients. We conclude that intermittent rifampin administration is effective in decreasing catheter-related infections in a peritoneal dialysis population. \nDissecting the primary causes of genetic hypertension in rats. Blood pressure has a genetic component influenced by several to many genetic loci in both humans and animals; that is, blood pressure is a polygenic trait. Ultimately, the primary causes of genetic hypertension can only be established with genetic techniques. The primary tools for this analysis in animals are inbred strains of rodents selectively bred for differences in blood pressure and the genetic analysis of these strains by cosegregation techniques. This analysis determines whether it is possible to separate specific alleles at a candidate genetic locus from a component of blood pressure in genetically segregating populations. If the candidate alleles cosegregate with a component of blood pressure, these alleles must be the cause of the blood pressure differences or be linked on the same chromosome to alleles at other loci that cause blood pressure differences. If, on the other hand, the candidate alleles do not cosegregate with blood pressure, they cannot be the cause of the blood pressure differences. This analysis is straightforward in the case of a single-locus Mendelian candidate trait but is less informative if a candidate trait is itself polygenic. In this case, genetic analysis yields either 1) results that are compatible with, but not definitive proof for, a genetic role of the trait in causing blood pressure differences or 2) results that eliminate the trait as a cause of genetic differences in blood pressure. A complete listing of all the traits that have undergone genetic cosegregation analysis in rodents is given. \nThe diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy using an algometer. Thirty-three patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy were studied prospectively to ascertain the pressure-pain threshold of affected and unaffected limbs. The affected side had a lower threshold which was found to be statistically significant. In all 18 patients with upper limb involvement, the pain threshold was reduced on the affected side, but this applied to only 11 of the 15 with leg involvement. This difference may be because patients with lower limb symptoms had been referred later in the course of the syndrome. We showed by repeated tests that after an average of 49 days there was a slow return to normality. The estimation of pressure-pain thresholds may help in the earlier diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. \nMesh-constricted varicose and dilated veins used as arterial bypass grafts. To avoid non-autogenous vascular prostheses in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures, otherwise unusable dilated, varicose or thin-walled veins can be implanted as naturally endothelialized grafts after being calibrated by insertion into mesh tubes. In six sheep the 14 mm diameter jugular vein was inserted into a 12 cm long, 6 mm diameter Dacron mesh tube and implanted as a femoropopliteal graft. On the contralateral side the femoral vein with a maximal diameter of 7 to 8 mm was implanted. At control angiography after two months all grafts were patent, none of the wrapped grafts showed wrinkles or signs of anastomotic hyperplasia. Segments of wrapped veins were casted in paraffin under physiological pressure and cut transversely. In all cases the vein wall was pressed against the mesh tubes without forming folds. Mesh-wrapped varicose veins were used for three femorocrural and seven femoropopliteal reconstructions. All grafts showed a smooth flow surface at control angiography. Indentations occurred only at sites where thick-walled side branches had been ligated rather than oversewn. One popliteo-pedal reconstruction occluded after two months and one patient with a crural reconstruction died two months after surgery with a patent graft. The remaining grafts were patent after 11 (2-32) months. Oversized veins can be considerably constricted by tubes without forming wrinkles. By this technique varicose veins can be used as bypass grafts and in general vein grafts can be matched in size to the recipient vessel. \nOutcome in children who nearly drown: a British Isles study OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome in nearly drowned children in the British Isles and identify factors that might predict a poor prognosis. DESIGN--Study of drowned and of nearly drowned children aged less than or equal to 14. Information on nearly drowned children admitted to hospital obtained from consultant paediatricians returning monthly notification cards through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Information on drowned children obtained from Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and other national epidemiological offices. SETTING--British Isles, 1988 and 1989. SUBJECTS--330 children who had confirmed submersion incidents. 142 died before admission to hospital and 188 children were admitted after nearly drowning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death, full recovery, or degree of handicap after near drowning and signs on admission to hospital. RESULTS--All of the children who were conscious on admission fully recovered. Of the 64 children unconscious on admission, 31 had normally reactive pupils and all but three (all of whom had severe preexisting neurological disease) recovered fully. Of the 33 children with fixed dilated pupils on admission, 10 fully recovered, 13 died, and 10 had severe neurological deficit. Spontaneous respiratory effect on admission was associated with normal survival. Pupils that remained dilated six hours after admission and fits continuing 24 hours after admission predicted a poor outcome. CONCLUSION--Children can survive normally after near drowning in the British Isles, particularly if they have been hypothermic. Resuscitation should not be abandoned in nearly drowned children until they have been rewarmed. \nIncreasing breast cancer screening among the medically underserved--Dade County, Florida, September 1987-March 1991. Efforts to detect breast cancer at early stages are critical in reducing breast cancer-associated mortality. However, in the United States, different barriers (e.g., lack of insurance, limited access to medical care, and limited awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment) prevent certain groups from using early detection services. To promote early detection of breast cancer among an estimated 67,000 medically underserved women aged greater than or equal to 40 years, the Early Detection Program (EDP) was begun in Dade County, Florida, in the fall of 1987 (1). This report summarizes the progress of the program for September 1987 through March 1991. \nOutcome of infants and children with dilated cardiomyopathy. A review of 81 infants and children with dilated, poorly contracting left ventricles without associated structural abnormalities was undertaken to identify risk factors for poor outcome, which could be used in selecting candidates for cardiac transplantation. Significant atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias, or both, were detected on presentation or during follow-up in 24 patients. Arrhythmias were present in only 8 of 51 survivors (16%) but were detected in 16 of 30 patients (53%) who died (p less than 0.05). Patients dying suddenly were even more likely to have had documented dysrhythmias (8 of 11, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular shortening fraction was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors (14.9 +/- 1.0% vs 15.3 +/- 1.7%). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in 44 patients who had cardiac catheterization averaged 20.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in patients who died than in those who survived (29.5 +/- 2.2 vs 15.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Analysis of actuarial survival revealed that mortality was highest during the first 6 months after presentation (19% mortality). Survival declined more gradually thereafter and was 70% at 2 years, 64% at 5 years and 52% after 11.5 years. Age at initial presentation did not have any significant impact on survival. However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 25 torr was associated with a significantly increased mortality rate (p less than 0.05). Early cardiac transplantation should be considered in patients with markedly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or complex atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. \nInner ear damage secondary to diabetes mellitus. I. Changes in adolescent SHR/N-cp rats. The association between diabetes mellitus and hearing impairment has been debated in many previous studies. The spontaneous hypertensive/NIH-corpulent (SHR/N-cp) rat has been shown to be a unique genetic model for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Seventeen diabetic and 17 control young male rats were divided into groups according to diet and phenotype. The rats were fed either 54% of sucrose or 54% starch diets for 3.5 months and killed at 5 months. The cochleas were fixed, decalcified, dissected, and stained for hair cell counting. A significant loss of outer hair cells was noted in the diabetic obese (SHR/N-cp) animals when compared with the control obese (LA/N-cp) animals in every group. Although no significant difference was noted between the diabetic obese (SHR/N-cp) animals receiving the starch and sugar diets, the diabetic obese (SHR/N-cp) animals were more severely affected than the nondiabetic lean (SHR/N-cp) rats. \nCortical benzodiazepine receptor binding in patients with generalized and partial epilepsy. Impaired cortical inhibition may be involved in epileptogenic mechanisms. In a positron-emission tomography (PET) study, we demonstrated a reduction of the cortical benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor density in the epileptic foci of patients with partial epileptic seizures. In the present study, we used the same method in 10 patients with primary generalized epilepsy to determine whether an altered BZD receptor binding could also be demonstrated in this patient group. The [11C]-labeled BZD receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 was used as ligand. Receptor affinities and densities were calculated in various cortical regions and then compared with the values from corresponding \"nonepileptic\" regions in the previously examined partial epilepsy patients. Focal alterations of the BZD receptor density or affinity were not demonstrated in patients with generalized epilepsy. This patient group had a slight tendency toward lower mean cortical BZD receptor density, however, as compared with corresponding values from 10 patients with partial epilepsy. Our results strongly suggest that a focal alteration of cortical inhibition is not a prominent feature of human generalized epilepsy. The observed tendency toward lower mean cortical BZD receptor density may be a consequence of diffusely impaired cortical inhibition. Further investigations of this issue are therefore indicated. \nSynthesis and evaluation of new iodine-125 radiopharmaceuticals as potential tracers for malignant melanoma. The synthesis, labeling, and biodistribution of four 125I radiopharmaceuticals designed to localize in melanoma were tested. Uptake in tumors was demonstrated by autoradiography of whole-body sections and quantitated by measurement of radioactivity of selected tissues and tumors using melanoma-bearing mice. N-(2-diethylaminoethyl)-4-iodobenzamide was selected for its highest melanoma uptake: 60 min after IV injection of 6.5% and 4% ID/g, respectively for murine B16 and human melanotic melanoma. Tumor uptake showed the highest values of all analyzed tissues from 6 to 24 hr after injection. High uptake in melanotic tumor tissue with relatively low uptake in blood, muscle, brain, lung, and liver tissue resulted in high tumor/nontumor ratios (at 24 hr for B16, tumor/blood = 37, tumor/brain = 147, tumor/muscle = 95). This agent was compared with iodoamphetamine. Scintigraphic images of the tumor confirmed that external detection of melanoma is possible with this new radiopharmaceutical. \nCholedocholithiasis in acute gallstone pancreatitis. Incidence and clinical significance. A prospective study of choledocholithiasis was performed using 110 patients with presumptive diagnoses of acute gallstone pancreatitis. The incidence of migrating and persistent bile duct stones was determined using stool screening and intraoperative cholangiography, and the clinical significance of continued stone obstruction of the papilla was investigated using ultrasound assessment of migration time and a second evaluation of prognostic signs. Pancreatic inflammation was confirmed at surgery in 51 patients, of whom only 27 had stones in the stools (n = 22) or the bile duct (n = 5), suggesting that choledocholithiasis may not be the sole triggering factor of acute gallstone pancreatitis. Neither delayed migration nor persistent stone obstruction of the papilla promoted pancreatic inflammation. \nDissecting aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The authors present three cases of dissecting aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). A literature search revealed only three previous cases. Analysis of these six cases showed a unique clinical picture. Three patients developed subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the other three had ischemia. All patients complained of occipital headache or neck pain, regardless of the initial symptoms. Heralding episodes were recorded in four cases. Angiography showed a characteristic fusiform dilatation of the PICA and a narrowing proximal to and distal to the lesion. Various surgical treatments were performed in five cases. Intraoperative observation showed a sausage-like swelling of the PICA or one of its branches with various discoloration depending on the age of the intramural clot. The outcomes were favorable. \nInterference between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep in near miss SIDS. GER may be considered as one of the triggering factors in some apparently life-threatening events or even SIDS. Also at the present time, many teams perform 24-h pH monitoring in at-risk infants and treat those with abnormal scores. However, further investigations are needed to answer the question: Which unknown additional factor(s) is present when a specific episode of GER causes apnea and/or bradycardia either during sleep or wakefulness?. \nStromal osseous metaplasia in carcinoma of the bladder. Osseous metaplasia of the stroma of carcinomas of the bladder is a rare finding that must be distinguished from osteosarcoma and carcinosarcoma. We report a case of multifocal osseous metaplasia in a high grade urothelial carcinoma with extensive glandular differentiation, arising in the base of the bladder of an 84-year-old man. Reports of 11 other cases of stromal osseous metaplasia in primary bladder carcinomas and of 5 cases of stromal osseous metaplasia in metastases of bladder carcinoma are reviewed. \nEffects of interferon-gamma therapy on thyroid function, T-lymphocyte subpopulations and induction of autoantibodies. Treatment with human leucocyte interferon (IFN alpha) has been associated with the development of thyroid autoimmunity and hypothyroidism, but it is not certain whether this phenomenon was a result of contamination with IFN gamma, which induced HLA class II antigen expression on T-lymphocytes. We prospectively studied 11 subjects (5 females and 6 males; mean age, 26.8 yr; range, 18-36) with chronic active hepatitis B who were randomized to receive recombinant human IFN gamma (rhIFN gamma; 10(6) U/m2.day, im, 3 times/week) for 16 weeks. Goiter was not present, and no patient had a history or family history of autoimmune diseases. Serial thyroid functions, including serum T4, T3, free thyroid hormone index, free T4 and TSH before, during, and on subsequent follow-up for a period of 1 yr were all normal. Eight patients had adequate serial samples for study of serological and lymphocyte subpopulations. None of the patients treated with rhIFN gamma developed thyroglobulin or thyroid microsomal antibodies. However, four patients developed antinuclear and smooth muscle autoantibodies during or after rhIFN gamma treatment. Treatment with rhIFN gamma resulted in a significant increase in circulating T-lymphocytes and HLA-DR-positive T-cells (P less than 0.05), with equal proportions of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells becoming DR positive. The percentage of HLA-DR-positive T-cells remained elevated after discontinuation of rhIFN gamma. Also, rhIFN gamma treatment led to a decrease in the number of circulating granulocytes and interleukin-2 receptor-positive cells. In conclusion, we did not observe any thyroid dysfunction or thyroid autoimmunity in our patients treated with the studied dose of rhIFN gamma, but induction of other autoantibodies was observed. \nPericardial mass mimicking constrictive pericarditis. Persistent pericardial hematoma due to blunt chest trauma is extremely rare. We report a case of constricted myocardium resulting from a large, partially organized hematoma in the right cardiophrenic angle. The hematoma was assumed to be caused by an occupational accident 17 years before diagnosis. Constriction could only be controlled by complete removal of the fibrous posterior capsule of the hematoma, which covered the epicardium of the right heart. \nThe effect of an extra-articular procedure on allograft reconstructions for chronic ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament. A study was performed on the effect of the addition of an extra-articular procedure involving tenodesis of the iliotibial band to a reconstruction with a bone-patellar ligament-bone allograft for the treatment of chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. One hundred and four patients were divided into two groups for comparison: Group 1 (sixty-four patients) was treated with only an intra-articular replacement with an allograft and Group 2 (forty patients), with both an intra-articular replacement with an allograft and the extra-articular procedure. Preoperatively, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of twenty variables, including body weight, level of activity, anterior-posterior displacements, number of previous operations, and duration of follow-up. All of the patients returned for follow-up evaluation twenty-three to fifty-four months (mean, thirty-five months) postoperatively. All were treated with the same postoperative program of immediate motion of the knee and rehabilitation. The results were evaluated with the use of a comprehensive subjective and objective system that rated the twenty factors. Both procedures proved to be effective in decreasing functional limitations and symptoms and in improving the level of sports activity and the over-all scores. The results in Group 2 were significantly better than those in Group 1, as measured with tests done with the KT-1000 arthrometer (p less than 0.01) and with regard to the level of sports activity (p less than 0.05) and the over-all scores (p less than 0.01). There was no postoperative difference between the two groups in terms of the results on pivot-shift or isokinetic testing, patellofemoral crepitus, functional limitations, or symptoms. The program of rehabilitation effectively restored 0 to 135 degrees of motion to all but four knees, which lacked 5 degrees of extension at the most recent follow-up. The over-all rate of failure for both groups was 11 per cent. However, the rate of failure was 16 per cent (ten of sixty-four knees) in Group 1 and only 3 per cent (one of forty knees) in Group 2. This difference was significant (p less than 0.05). The extra-articular procedure appeared to provide support to the healing intra-articular allograft by reducing deleterious forces and tibial displacements, and to restore the secondary restraints provided by the lateral iliotibial band. The results suggest that the combination of the procedures is of value in young, athletically active people who have chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nNasal administration of salmon calcitonin for prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in children with nephrosis. To determine the effect of intranasal administration of salmon calcitonin on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in children with nephrosis, we gave 100 U of calcitonin intranasally on alternate days with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 to five children, 8 to 12 years of age, with frequently relapsing nephrosis. Four patients with osteoporosis, 10 to 14 years of age, were treated only with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and served as control subjects. Both groups were treated with an almost equal amount of glucocorticoids previously and during this study period. Bone mineral content of the spine was measured by a quantitative computed tomographic technique. The bone mineral content was preserved in both cortical and spongeous areas of the vertebrae during the 16-month period in the calcitonin-treated group but was decreased significantly in the control group. Urinary hydroxyproline and calcium excretion decreased significantly in the calcitonin-treated group. The serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations and the parathyroid function did not change significantly in either group. We conclude that calcitonin suppressed bone resorption and might be useful for the long-term treatment of osteoporosis, in combination with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, in children with nephrosis requiring long-term glucocorticoid therapy. \nSudden unexpected death due to papillary fibroma of the aortic valve. Report of a case and review of the literature. The case of the sudden unexpected death of a 21-year-old man due to embolization of segments of an aortic valve papillary fibroma to the left main and anterior descending coronary artery is presented. The literature regarding cardiac papillary fibroma is reviewed with particular reference to those cases associated with sudden death. \nAdrenergic regulation of (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in proximal tubules of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Increased renal nerve activity and sodium retention have been implicated in the development of hypertension in genetically transmitted forms of this disease. The present studies were designed to investigate the relationship between renal nerve integrity and renal proximal tubule (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity of basolateral membranes (BLMs) enriched from proximal tubules of five-week-old SHR was greater, 328.6 +/- 18.9 nmol Pi/mg protein.min, than in age-matched genetic controls rats (Wistar-Kyoto, WKY, rats), 262.3 +/- 34.6 nmol Pi/mg protein.min (P less than 0.02). There was no detectable difference in (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity of 13-week-old SHR and WKY rats. Prior renal denervation was associated with a reduction in proximal tubule basolateral membrane (BLM) (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity, 316.8 +/- 23.8 to 223.1 +/- 23.9 nmol Pi/mg protein/min (P less than 0.02), in five-week SHR. However, denervation had no effect on renal (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in either WKY rats, nor did sham-denervation in SHR. In addition, exogenous norepinephrine, 1 microM, produced a more pronounced stimulation of (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in basolateral membranes from SHR as opposed to WKY controls (40.2% vs. 28.7%). Therefore, renal nerve integrity and exogenous catecholamines have a greater stimulatory influence on proximal tubule (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in the early stages (prior to 5 weeks) of the development of hypertension in SHR than in age-matched WKY rats. \nPostmortem studies of the heart in three fatal cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hearts of individuals who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan, with particular attention paid to the coronary arteries, the neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart because of reported terminal disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction. STUDY MATERIAL: Three hearts fixed in neutral formalin and well preserved with all the relevant areas of conduction system intact. METHODS: Light microscopic examination of subserial sections of the sinus node, atrioventricular node and His bundle, coronary chemoreceptor and regional nerves, ganglia, and small coronary arteries. Routine stains used were Goldner trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson. RESULTS: Arterial abnormalities were numerous and primarily of two types: focal fibromuscular dysplasia causing moderate to severe narrowing, as well as endarteritis and panarteritis. Extensive examples of neuritis and ganglionitis were present throughout the heart, including the conduction system, where arterial abnormalities were also abundant. In the coronary chemoreceptor there were both old and new lesions comprising focal inflammation with degeneration as well as older areas of fibrotic destruction. Within the sinus node, areas of dense fibrosis replaced all nodal tissue. These abnormalities were similar in nature and extent in all three hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic lesions present in the coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system of the heart in patients who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome provide a suitable anatomic substrate for substantial cardiac electrical instability, including the occurrence of sudden death. In cases of unexplained cardiac electrical instability or sudden unexpected death an inquiry should be made about previous use of L-tryptophan. In patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the possibility of cardiac electrical instability should be considered as part of long-range clinical management. \nPlasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, beta-thromboglobulin, and fibrinopeptide A before, during, and after treatment of acute myocardial infarction with alteplase. Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG), and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) were followed over 24 hours in 30 patients treated with alteplase for acute myocardial infarction. Samples were taken at baseline (T Oh), after 90 minutes (under alteplase, no heparin, T 1.5h), after 120 minutes (under alteplase and heparin, T 2h), 30 minutes after thrombolytic therapy (T 3.5h), as well as 12 hours (T 12h) and 24 hours (T 24h) after baseline. PAI-1 antigen levels (55 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh, mean +/- SEM) decreased to 35 +/- 5 (T 1.5h) and 40 +/- 6 (T 2h) ng/mL under alteplase, before increasing to 84 +/- 22 (T 3.5h), 130 +/- 30 (T 12h), and 64 +/- 7 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy, P less than .001. A high baseline PAI-1 activity (18 +/- 3 ng/mL) decreased to 2.0 +/- 0.4 (T 1.5h) and 1.7 +/- 0.2 (T 2h) under alteplase and increased to 32 +/- 5 (T 12h) and 19 +/- 3 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy (P less than .0001). beta TG levels (339 +/- 105 ng/mL at T Oh) decreased to 203 +/- 48 (T 2h), 154 +/- 51 (T 3.5h), 187 +/- 40 (T 12h), and 142 +/- 32 (T 24h) ng/mL under heparin (P less than .01). FPA levels (34 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh) increased to 85 +/- 15 ng/mL under alteplase alone (T 1.5h) and normalized under heparin (11 +/- 4, 6 +/- 2, 4 +/- 2, and 3 +/- 1 ng/mL at T 2h, T 3.5h, T 12h, and T 24h, respectively). A high level of FPA at T 3.5h correlated with reocclusion (33 +/- 12 ng/mL, n = 4 v 2.9 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, n = 21, P less than .005). We conclude that plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen as well as activity markedly increase after alteplase therapy of acute myocardial infarction. The high activity of PAI-1 and decreasing beta TG levels suggest that platelets do not contribute significantly to this phenomenon. The marked increase of FPA levels under recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator alone and its normalization under heparin emphasize the important role of concomitant anticoagulation in controlling further intravasal fibrin generation under alteplase. \nCoupling between the heart and arterial system in heart failure. A number of experimental studies have demonstrated the optimal coupling between the ventricle and arterial load, under physiologic and pathologic circumstances, directed to produce maximal stroke work. We investigated matching of the ventricular properties, quantified by the slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, with arterial load properties, expressed by the slope of end-systolic pressure-stroke volume relationship. In normal subjects, with ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 60%, ventricular elastance was nearly twice as large as arterial elastance. This condition affords maximal mechanical efficiency. In patients with moderate heart failure, with ejection fraction of 40-59%, ventricular elastance was almost equal to arterial elastance. This condition affords maximal stroke work from a given end-diastolic volume. In patients with severe heart failure, with ejection fraction of less than 40%, ventricular elastance was less than half of arterial elastance, which resulted in increased potential energy and decreased work efficiency. Ventriculoarterial coupling is normally set toward higher left ventricular work efficiency, whereas in patients with moderate cardiac dysfunction, ventricular and arterial properties are matched, in order to maximize stroke work at the expense of work efficiency. Neither the stroke work nor work efficiency is near maximum for patients with severe cardiac dysfunction. \nNutrition and metabolism in sepsis and multisystem organ failure. Sepsis and organ failure produce profound metabolic changes that contribute to hepatic and musculoskeletal failure. When multiple organ failure develops, the mortality rate is high, and therapy is unlikely to be effective unless the causative process (e.g., infection, low cardiac output) can be eliminated. Thus, the prevention of multiple organ failure and the prevention or early treatment of infection are paramount. Organ and nutritional support to prevent complications is necessary. The gastrointestinal tract should be used for nutrition whenever possible with a blenderized regular diet with fiber, glutamine, and short-chain fatty acids to protect and preserve the gut. If parenteral nutrition is necessary, special solutions may be necessary for the liver, kidneys, or lungs. If not, protein with 45% branched-chain amino acid, medium- and short-chain triglycerides, glutamine supplementation, and carbohydrates seem best. Other substances are being evaluated that may be helpful in nutrition and organ support, including arginine, xylitol, growth hormone, and anabolic steroids. Multiple organ failure should be prevented, if at all possible, by stopping or controlling the injury, removing as much necrotic tissue as possible, improving blood flow and oxygen consumption, supporting metabolism, and preventing infection or treating it early and adequately. Nutritional support plays a key role in preventing metabolic failure. \nReducing postischemic paraplegia using conjugated superoxide dismutase. Paraplegia after thoracic aortic aneurysm repair has an incidence of 2.2% to 24%. Oxygen-derived free radicals after reperfusion of an ischemic spinal cord may be partly responsible for neuronal destruction. We studied the effects of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), a free radical scavenger, as a way of increasing spinal cord tolerance to ischemia. Thirty rabbits underwent 40 minutes of aortic occlusion (a known model of paraplegia). Ten of these animals received 25,000 U/kg of PEG-SOD 24 hours before aortic occlusion and two additional doses of 10,000 U/kg, one before and one subsequent to spinal ischemia. Ten animals received superoxide dismutase in the same dosages as those receiving PEG-SOD. Ten control animals received placebo. All animals were studied for 96 hours, at which time a final neurological examination was performed and the results were recorded. Of the 10 animals treated with PEG-SOD, 2 were completely paralyzed whereas 8 had less (7) or no (1) neurological impairment. Eight of the 10 control animals and 9 of the 10 animals receiving superoxide dismutase were completely paralyzed. None of the control animals or animals receiving superoxide dismutase had a normal neurological examination (p less than or equal to 0.05). Treatment with PEG-SOD before and during occlusion increased the rabbit spinal cord tolerance to a 40-minute ischemic insult. Scavenging free radicals may lessen experimental spinal cord injury. \nStaple closure of the hypopharynx after diverticulectomy and total laryngectomy. The use of stapling devices to close hypopharyngeal defects was first published in 1969 but the technique does not seem to have gained much popularity among head and neck surgeons. Fifty-nine hypopharyngeal defects were closed using a linear stapler between January, 1984, and April, 1989, at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital of Zurich. Twenty closures were performed following resection of hypopharyngeal diverticula, 39 following wide field laryngectomy. A total of 10 salivary fistulae was observed: 2 after diverticulectomy (10%), 3 after laryngectomy in nonirradiated patients (11%), and 5 after laryngectomy in irradiated patients (45%). These fistula rates are comparable with average rates quoted in the literature. Only after laryngectomy for radiation failure was the fistula rate unusually high. No other complications were seen that could have been attributed to this type of pharyngeal closure. Closure of a hypopharyngeal defect with a stapler is easier and faster than with traditional suture methods. Provided the patient has not been previously irradiated, staple closure of the hypopharynx appears to be as reliable as closure by standard techniques and can be safely recommended. \nRole for tumor necrosis factor as mediator of lung injury following lower torso ischemia. Ischemia and reperfusion of the ischemic lower torso lead to a neutrophil- (PMN) dependent lung injury characterized by PMN sequestration and permeability edema. This mimics the injury seen after infusion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), a potent activator of PMN and endothelium. This study tests whether TNF is a mediator of the lung injury after lower torso ischemia. Anesthetized rats underwent 4 h of bilateral hindlimb tourniquet ischemia, followed by reperfusion for 10 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h (n = 6 for each time point). Quantitative lung histology indicated progressive sequestration of PMN in the lungs, 25 +/- 3 (SE) PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) 10 min after reperfusion vs. 20 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in sham animals (NS), increasing to 53 +/- 5 PMN/10 HPF after 4 h vs. 23 +/- 3 PMN/10 HPF in sham animals (P less than 0.01). There was lung permeability, shown by increasing protein accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, which 4 h after reperfusion was 599 +/- 91 vs. 214 +/- 35 micrograms/ml in sham animals (P less than 0.01). Similarly, there was edema, shown by the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, which increased by 4 h to 4.70 +/- 0.12 vs. 4.02 +/- 0.17 in sham animals (P less than 0.01). There was generation of leukotriene B4 in BAL fluid (720 +/- 140 vs. 240 +/- 40 pg/ml, P less than 0.01), and in three of six rats tested at this time TNF was detected in plasma, with a mean value of 167 pg/ml. TNF was not detectable in any sham animal. \nAnaesthesia for a patient with giant axonal neuropathy. Giant axonal neuropathy is a generalised disorder of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments which particularly involves the peripheral and central nervous systems. In this paper we describe a child with giant axonal neuropathy and discuss the anaesthetic management in the light of the pathology and physiology of the condition. \nDistribution of thymic tissue in the mediastinal adipose tissue. The distribution of thymic tissue in the anterior mediastinal, retrocarinal, and preaortic fat was examined histologically in 27 autopsy subjects. Thymic tissue was found in the anterior mediastinal fat in 12 subjects (44.4%), in the retrocarinal fat in two (7.4%), and in the preaortic fat in none. The finding of ectopic thymic tissue in these areas has not been reported previously, would appear to be surgically inaccessible via a median sternotomy, and may be responsible in part for some of the failures of thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. \nJaundice and cholestasis. Some common and uncommon causes. Jaundiced patients may not always be as sick as they look, and cholestatic patients may be quite ill but not yet jaundiced. There is variability in presentation of cholestasis, and jaundice may be intrahepatic or extrahepatic and acute or chronic. Even though the diagnosis of jaundice can be elusive, an unnecessarily exhaustive search for a cause should be avoided, because some tests are not without dangers. Dr Gordon describes many possible causes, some of which are rare but are still worth consideration. \nColorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis. Influence of anatomical extent and age at onset on colitis-cancer interval. We have examined the age at onset of both ulcerative colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer in 100 patients seen at Mount Sinai Hospital between 1959 and 1988. There were 85 patients with extensive colitis and 15 with left sided colitis. There was a strong direct correlation between the age at onset of ulcerative colitis and age at diagnosis of cancer (p less than 0.0001); this correlation was found both in patients with extensive colitis (p less than 0.0001) and in those with left sided colitis (p less than 0.005). Patients with left sided colitis developed both their colitis and their cancers about a decade later than did those with extensive disease, but the mean duration of colitis before diagnosis of cancer was virtually the same (about 21 years) in both groups, irrespective of the age at onset of disease. \nBilateral chylothorax. A 2.5-kg female developed bilateral chylothoraces 10 days after surgery for coarctation of the aorta. Initial conservative management consisted of intermittent positive pressure ventilation, drainage of chylous fluid and enteral feeding, but there was no diminution in loss of chyle. Ligation of the thoracic duct and pleurectomy were performed subsequently to reduce the large daily losses of chyle, amounting to nearly three times the child's circulating blood volume. Brawny oedema of the right upper quadrant of the body developed rapidly after the duct ligation and right pleurectomy. A further period of conservative treatment was required before the latter complication resolved. The literature relating to this iatrogenic complication and to fluid and nutritional losses in paediatric chylothorax is reviewed and discussed. \nDiagnosis and treatment of headache in the elderly. The diagnosis and management of some causes of headache in the elderly are reviewed. Etiologic theories have been presented for each condition. Treatment modalities include pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and surgical the",
