        "text": "ation, distortion of skin cleavage lines on tangential lighting, asymmetry, and number of colors present (12 features in all). Nineteen histologic features were assessed in each nevus by a single dermatopathologist. These included architectural, nuclear, and cytoplasmic parameters ascribed to dysplastic nevi. Each of these histologic features was correlated with the 12 individual clinical features. Seventeen percent of the nevi fulfilled the criteria for the histologic diagnosis of DMN. Among individual nevus parameters, size (in mm), irregular border, ill-defined border, macular component, and pink color were associated significantly with histologic DMN. Nevus size (in mm) and irregular borders correlated with the greatest number of individual histologic parameters. A comparison of clinicopathologic correlations for two different examiners revealed that certain clinical features are probably more important than others for the recognition of dysplastic nevi and that individual examiners have different thresholds for the perception of some gross morphologic features. These observations are relevant to the development of clinical criteria for dysplastic nevi. \nAcute non-A, non-B hepatitis in a hospital population in Warsaw, Poland: clinical and epidemiological aspects. In the years 1986-1988, 530 consecutive cases of acute viral hepatitis were admitted to an infectious disease hospital in Warsaw. Hepatitis A was diagnosed in 34 cases (6.4%), hepatitis B in 436 (82.3%), CMV infection in five (0.9%), and 55 cases (10.4%) were classified as hepatitis non-A, non-B. In 47 cases (85%) of non-A, non-B hepatitis, there was evidence of parenteral transmission, whereas in eight (15%), the source of infection was unknown. Chronic liver disease developed in 50% of patients with parenteral exposure, but there were no cases with known exposure. Seroconversion to anti-HCV was observed only in patients with parenteral exposure, and 60% of followed up cases developed antibodies within 6 months. \nPericardial effusion after intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator for acute myocardial infarction. The effect of thrombolytic therapy on the frequency, time course and sequelae of pericardial effusion after myocardial infarction are unknown. A prospective, serial, 2-dimensional echocardiographic study of patients with myocardial infarction who received recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was undertaken to address this issue. The study population comprised 52 of the 112 patients enrolled in the first Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction trial at Duke University Medical Center. Enrollment in the serial echocardiography protocol was determined by equipment and support staff availability. Complete echocardiographic studies were performed within 90 minutes after initiation of thrombolytic therapy (day 0), and on days 1, 3 and 6. Patients undergoing serial echocardiography did not differ in demographic or clinical characteristics from those who did not. Pericardial effusion was present in 3 of 38 patients (8%) at day 0, in 2 of 44 (5%) at day 1, in 8 of 43 (19%) at day 3, and in 10 of 42 (24%) at day 6. By day 6, 3 of 10 pericardial effusions were moderate in size, 1 of 10 was large and the remainder were small. No patients developed echocardiographic or hemodynamic signs of cardiac tamponade. The prevalence and time course of pericardial effusion among patients with acute myocardial infarction who received rt-PA in this study are similar to observations reported in earlier studies in which patients did not receive thrombolytic therapy. Adverse sequelae of pericardial effusion after thrombolytic therapy are rare. \nDeveloping a dysphagia program in an acute care hospital: a needs assessment. A needs assessment for a hospital-based dysphagia program was conducted to determine incidence, management procedures, and outcome for stroke patients with swallowing disorders. Using a chart review of 225 patients, it was found that 28% had documented evidence of dysphagia. When dysphagia co-occurred with stroke, significantly more functional problems and medical complications were reported, as well as increased need for dietary modifications and alternative feeding methods. The dysphagic patients were more often aphasic and dysarthric and less able to communicate. Mental status was more likely to be reduced and the need for staff supervision during mealtime was increased. Dysphagic patients had significantly longer hospital stays, thus increasing the cost of their care. At discharge, almost half of them continued to need feeding modifications, which may have delayed rehabilitation or transfer to facilities with other levels of care. The dysphagia group clearly displayed a wide range of clinical symptoms that would alert staff to their risk for medical complications because of swallowing problems. We believe that this needs assessment clearly showed that a multidisciplinary dysphagia management program has the potential to enhance patient care while decreasing the cost of health care delivery for the hospital. \nComputerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging following cranial base surgery. The computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging films of 57 patients who underwent anterior or anterolateral cranial base surgery from January 1987 to August 1989 were retrospectively reviewed to ascertain the significance of early and late postoperative intracranial imaging changes. Extra-axial changes (air, blood, cerebrospinal fluid collection) were found in 96% of patients; axial changes (brain edema, contusion) were seen in 30% of patients in the first postoperative period (72 hours). Subsequently, extra-axial changes began to resolve but axial changes became more prevalent. After 6 months, only axial changes persisted (encephalomalacia). It was encouraging to find a low correlation of imaging abnormalities with clinically significant findings. \nResistant hypertension in a tertiary care clinic. STUDY OBJECTIVE.--To determine the prevalence of resistant hypertension in a tertiary care facility, the frequency of its various causes, and the results of treatment. DESIGN.--Review of clinic records of all patients seen for the first time between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1988. METHODS.--Patients meeting criteria for resistant hypertension were examined for appropriateness of their medical regimen, presence of secondary causes of hypertension, noncompliance, interfering substances, drug interactions, office resistance (elevated blood pressure in the office only while receiving treatment), and other potential causes of resistance. RESULTS.--Of the 436 charts reviewed, 91 were those of patients who met criteria for resistant hypertension and were seen more than once. The most common cause was a suboptimal medical regimen (39 patients), followed by medication intolerance (13 patients), previously undiagnosed secondary hypertension (10 patients), noncompliance (nine patients), psychiatric causes (seven patients), office resistance (two patients), an interfering substance (two patients), and drug interaction (one patient). Blood pressure control, defined as diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less and systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or less for patients aged 50 years or less (less than or equal to 150 mm Hg for those aged 51 to 60 years and less than or equal to 160 mm Hg for those aged greater than 60 years), was achieved in 48 (53%) of those 91 patients. Another 10 had significant improvement in their blood pressure (greater than or equal to 15% decrease in diastolic blood pressure). Of patients whose blood pressure was controlled after they had been on a suboptimal regimen, the two most frequently used therapeutic strategies were to add (50%) or modify (24%) diuretic therapy or to add (50%) or increase the dose of (12%) a newer drug, either a calcium entry blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. CONCLUSION.--We conclude that resistant hypertension is common in a tertiary care facility and that a suboptimal regimen is the most common reason. Furthermore, in the majority of these patients, the elevated blood pressures can be controlled or significantly improved. \nPercutaneous transluminal angioplasty of aortocoronary venous bypass grafts and effect of the caliber of the grafted coronary artery on graft stenosis. The influence of morphologic parameters on the recurrence of stenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of 49 stenoses in aortocoronary venous bypass grafts of 41 patients was investigated. Vessel dimensions were measured quantitatively. Angioplasty was successful in 46 stenoses (94%) of 38 patients (93%). In 35 patients (92% of successfully treated patients) with 42 stenoses, control angiography was performed after a mean interval of 189 +/- 186 days. In 9 patients (26%), 9 stenoses (21%) had recurred. The diameter of the grafted coronary artery distal to the anastomosis was significantly smaller in grafted arteries with than without recurrent stenoses (1.92 +/- 0.52 vs 2.45 +/- 0.50 mm; p less than 0.01). Recurrence also correlated with the ratio between graft diameter and coronary artery diameter greater than 1.35 (p less than 0.02) and with the stenosis length greater than 10 mm before angioplasty (p less than 0.01). Graft age, graft diameter and stenosis location in the graft had no significant influence on recurrence. Thus, the diameter of the grafted coronary artery and the length of the critical stenosis are parameters for recurrence after angioplasty of graft stenoses and should be considered in the selection of patients for this intervention. \nProlonged paralysis after treatment with neuromuscular junction blocking agents. OBJECTIVES: Previous reports have described prolonged paralysis after treatment with neuromuscular junction blocking agents in critically ill patients. The purpose of this study was to further describe a group of patients who developed prolonged weakness after treatment with these agents. DESIGN: Clinical information, electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology results are described in this group of patients. Clinical information includes diagnoses, dosage of neuromuscular junction blocker, other medications affecting the neuromuscular system, and neuromuscular examination and clinical course. SETTING: All patients were seen in the ICUs of three local hospitals. PATIENTS: Included were critically ill patients with a variety of diagnoses, all of whom developed severe weakness after discontinuation of neuromuscular junction blocking agents. INTERVENTIONS: Electrodiagnostic studies and muscle biopsies were performed on several of the patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients had pronounced weakness without sensory loss. Electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology findings were consistent with failed neuromuscular transmission. Although many patients had disorders or were taking medications that can injure the neuromuscular system, no disorder or medication was common to all. Recovery of strength often took several months and most patients were slow to wean from mechanical ventilator support. CONCLUSIONS: Although alternative explanations cannot be excluded with certainty, the use of neuromuscular junction blocking agents may lead to neurogenic atrophy and care must be taken when using them. \nInflammatory pseudotumor: a gallium-avid mobile mesenteric mass. An 8-yr-old boy with a 1-mo history of culture-negative fever and anemia underwent gallium, ultrasound, and computed tomography studies as part of the evaluation of a fever of unknown origin. These studies revealed a mobile gallium-avid solid abdominal mass subsequently proven to be an inflammatory pseudotumor of the mesentery, a rare benign mass. This report documents the gallium-avid nature of this rare lesion and discusses associated characteristic clinical, pathologic, and radiographic features. \nRadiologic evaluation of aortic dissection. The radiologic assessment of patients suspected of having an aortic dissection must be based on an understanding of the treatment options and how these are to be employed in any clinical setting. The appropriate selection and timing of imaging studies is crucial. The diagnosis of dissection must be quickly confirmed, other diseases that mimic dissection must be excluded, and the type and extent of dissection must be established so that appropriate therapy can be instituted. Although computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and echocardiography greatly enhanced the ability to evaluate the aorta by noninvasive means, aortography remains the examination of choice for defining the vascular anatomy, especially when surgical intervention is considered. MR imaging may become the primary examination for the initial and subsequent evaluation of acute and chronic dissections as MR angiographic techniques improve and changes are made in monitoring equipment to allow the safe examination of acutely ill patients. \nGenital chlamydial infections: epidemiology and reproductive sequelae. Genital chlamydial infection is increasing and is now more common than gonorrhea. A sizable percentage of chlamydial infections of the lower genital tract in women progress to endometritis and salpingitis. Tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy are important sequelae. Failure to control chlamydial infections reflects the following four factors: (1) Many cases are mild or asymptomatic; (2) diagnostic tests are expensive and technically demanding; (3) at least 7 days of multiple-dose therapy are currently required; and (4) partner notification is not routinely performed. Thus early identification of infected persons and compliance with curative therapy are less likely than with other sexually transmitted bacterial diseases. \nDetection of hepatitis B virus DNA sequences in liver in HBsAg seronegative patients with liver disease with and without anti-HBc antibodies. Excluding studies from Brechot and co-workers, little support has been found for a role of the hepatitis B virus in the pathogenesis of HBsAg seronegative patients with predominantly chronic liver diseases, including primary liver cancer. In this study liver DNA from 59 predominantly British patients (four cases with paired biopsies, 6-12 months apart) with different, mostly chronic, liver diseases was analysed by molecular hybridization. All were seronegative for HBsAg and serum hepatitis B virus DNA (dot blot hybridization) and their liver diseases were believed to be unrelated to hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in liver of 11 (18.6 per cent) patients; nine had episomal (3.2 Kb) DNA and eight had higher molecular weight bands suggesting integrated forms. Six patients were also seronegative for anti-HBc. Patients of UK and non-UK origin were equally represented. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in serum of six of nine patients tested using the polymerase chain reaction. The detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in liver and in serum by this assay in a significant proportion of patients with chronic liver disease, hitherto unsuspected of being hepatitis B virus-related, suggests a possible role for this virus in low- as well as high-prevalence countries. \nEvolution of renal insufficiency in ischemic nephropathy. This retrospective review of data collected during a recent 42-month period from 58 consecutive patients with ischemic nephropathy submitted to operative management in the authors' center was undertaken to report the rate of decline in their renal function during the period before intervention and to examine the impact of operation on their outcome. Based on serum creatinine values, immediate preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rates (EGFR) ranged from 0 to 46 mL/minute (mean, 23.85 +/- 9.76 mL/minute). Eight patients were dialysis dependent or anuric at the time of operation. Patients with at least three sequential measurements for calculations of EGFR changes during the 6 months before operation (n = 50) and the first 12 months after operation (n = 32) were used to describe the preoperative rate of decline in EGFR and the impact of operation on this decrease in the operative survivors. In addition comparative analyses of data from patients with unilateral versus bilateral lesions and patients classified as having improvement in EGFR versus no improvement after operation were performed. Comparison of the immediate preoperative EGFR with the immediate postoperative EGFR for the entire group showed significant improvement in response to operation. Likewise the rate of deterioration in EGFR for the total group was improved after operation. A similar improvement in the rate of deterioration in EGFR was seen in the subgroup of patients who received an immediate improvement in EGFR in response to operation. These data argue that ischemic nephropathy is a rapidly progressive form of renal insufficiency. Although individual responses to operation were heterogeneous, renal revascularization may provide both immediate improvement in renal function and an improvement in its rate of deterioration during follow-up in patients with ischemic nephropathy. \nMetastatic meningioma in the neck. Although meningiomas represent 15 per cent of tumours of the central nervous system, they rarely metastasize. A case is presented in which metastasis to a cervical lymph node occurred, together with local recurrence, nine years after initial diagnosis and treatment. This case serves to illustrate that malignant meningioma is a rare cause of a neck mass. \nValidation of a clinical antisaccadic eye movement test in the assessment of dementia. The ability to generate antisaccades (eye movements deliberately made in the direction opposite to that of a visual stimulus) may be used to assess central nervous system function in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. However, the usefulness of this paradigm in clinical practice is limited by the need for an oculographic laboratory. We describe a clinical version of such an antisaccadic task and present normative data from 332 subjects. We also examined clinical antisaccades and cognitive performance in 30 patients with Alzheimer's disease, five patients with Huntington's disease, and 12 patients with pseudodementia. In Alzheimer's disease, error rates in the clinical antisaccadic test correlated well with those from a laboratory-based antisaccadic task measured on the same day by infrared oculography, confirming that the clinical antisaccadic test is a valid analog of the more sophisticated laboratory paradigms. Clinical antisaccadic error rates correlated strongly with the severity of dementia in Alzheimer's disease, and correlations with cognitive performance suggested that the clinical antisaccadic test may have some specificity for frontal lobe dysfunction. Patients with pseudodementia had normal clinical antisaccadic error rates, and the test may therefore be of use in differentiating dementia from pseudodementia. This clinical antisaccadic test provides a simple, reliable, and inexpensive quantitative clinical tool that is of value in the assessment of disturbances of higher cortical function. \nNeuromodulatory effects of atrial natriuretic factor are independent of guanylate cyclase in adrenergic neuronal pheochromocytoma cells. This study tests the hypothesis that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and C-ANF(4-23)-NH2 (C-ANF) augment cGMP generation and inhibit both cAMP generation and depolarization-induced catecholamine release in nerve growth factor treated pheochromocytoma cells by a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive mechanism. Synthetic rat ANF(99-126) and the clearance receptor antagonist C-ANF (10(-12)-10(-9) M) inhibited basal and 5 microM vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced cAMP generation in a concentration-dependent manner. These actions of ANF and C-ANF were blocked by 12-18 h pretreatment with PTX (100 ng/ml), suggesting ANF receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase via an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein. Both ANF (10(-11)-10(-9) M) and C-ANF (10(-11)-10(-8) M) also inhibited K(+)-induced catecholamine release in a concentration-dependent manner. ANF (10(-11)-10(-8) M) increased cGMP generation in a concentration-dependent manner but C-ANF did not. The accumulation of cGMP in response to ANF was not altered by treatment with PTX. Therefore, PTX dissociated the increased concentrations of cGMP from the ANF-mediated depression of evoked catecholamine release. C-ANF also dissociated elevations in cGMP concentrations from an ANF-mediated attenuation of evoked catecholamine release. The results of this study indicate that ANF inhibits adrenergic neurotransmission independent of guanylate cyclase. \nLeptotrichia buccalis bacteremia in patients with cancer: report of four cases and review. Leptotrichia buccalis, an anaerobic gram-negative rod, is part of the normal oral flora and has rarely been isolated from clinical material. We describe four patients with neutropenia and progressive malignancy who had symptomatic L. buccalis bacteremia, and we review an additional four cases from the literature. The mean age of the patients was 31 years (range, 7-73 years), with an equal number of males and females. The number of positive blood cultures in each case ranged from one to four (mean, two); these cultures became positive after 48-120 hours (median, 54 hours). All tested isolates were sensitive to the beta-lactam agents, clindamycin, tetracycline, and metronidazole; five of seven were sensitive to chloramphenicol; and not one was sensitive to the aminoglycosides, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin. Seven patients had one or more possible portals of entry for bacteremia, including mucositis (four patients), mucositis plus esophageal lesions (two), and possible mucositis plus diverticulitis (one). L. buccalis should be considered a potential pathogen in neutropenic patients, especially when breaks in the mucosal breaks in the mucosal barriers are present. \nHow AIDS forces reappraisal of hepatitis B virus control in sub-Saharan Africa For developing countries the cost-benefit of vaccination in the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is great since the acute infection is generally subclinical and the benefit is the prevention of small numbers of cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since the pattern of HBV infection in Africa is such that, compared with south-east Asia, infection occurs later in childhood and spread is horizontal rather than vertical, investigation of the method of spread of HBV may result in a means of control other than by vaccination. In the meantime, because of the overlap in the means by which HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are spread, it could be worthwhile taking advantage of existing AIDS prevention programmes to educate people about how to avoid both HBV and HIV infections. \nImpending paradoxical embolism: a rare but important diagnosis. A man aged 50 presented with a history of a cerebrovascular accident and arterial embolism at two discrete peripheral sites. Echocardiography showed thrombus trapped in an interatrial site and impending paradoxical embolism was diagnosed. Treatment with heparin was started and the potentially embolic intracardiac material was removed at open heart surgery. The patient was treated with warfarin and made a good recovery. This is only the third case report of impending paradoxical embolism diagnosed in life. \nThe low-affinity p75 nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor mediates NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a potential mechanism for initial signaling in PC12 cells during differentiation in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation has been found to be initiated by the trk protooncogene, which participates in the formation of high-affinity NGF binding sites. In contrast to transfection of wild-type low-affinity p75 NGF receptors, transfection of p75NGFR with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain resulted in an inability of NGF to elicit tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates, indicating that p75NGFR is involved in initiating phosphorylation events by NGF. Even though the p75NGFR receptor does not possess any inherent tyrosine kinase activity, these experiments demonstrate that the p75NGFR has a potential role in NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. \nEffect of a cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase inhibitor, DN-9693, on myocardial reperfusion injury. A new cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase inhibitor, DN-9693, was examined to see whether myocardial reperfusion injury could be reduced in a setting of cardioplegic arrest through its antiaggregation effect on leukocytes. Isolated rabbit heart models with whole blood perfusion were used, and 18 hearts were divided into three groups according to the reperfusion method: control (G-1, n = 5), DN-9693 (G-2, n = 7), and leukocyte depletion (G-3, n = 6). The hearts were subjected to 120 minutes of cold global ischemia under crystalloid cardioplegia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. A dose of 20 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of DN-9693 was administered in G-2, and a leukocyte removal filter was used in G-3 during reperfusion. Ultrastructural changes in mitochondrial injuries, intracellular edema, and capillary injuries of the myocardium showed worse changes in G-1 than in G-2 and G-3. Under microscopic study, the intracapillary leukocyte count was significantly higher in G-1 than in G-2 and G-3. Recovery of rate-pressure product, left ventricular developed pressure, and coronary flow were significantly better in G-2 and G-3 than in G-1. There were no significant differences between G-2 and G-3 for all these indices. These results indicate that reperfusion with leukocyte-depleted blood attenuates reperfusion myocardial injury and DN-9693 has a comparable myocardial protective effect with possible inhibition of leukocyte aggregation. \nThe role of contraception in the development of postmolar gestational trophoblastic tumor. From January 1974 to June 1988, 299 evaluable patients were referred to the John I. Brewer Trophoblastic Disease Center of Northwestern University Cancer Center for treatment and/or follow-up of a hydatidiform mole (N = 162) or postmolar gestational trophoblastic tumor (N = 137). The type of contraception and other prognostic factors before and after evacuation were correlated with the development of gestational trophoblastic tumor using both univariate and multivariate analysis. There was no relationship between pre-hydatidiform mole contraception and the development of gestational trophoblastic tumor. Oral contraceptives (OCs) were used by 139 patients (46%), barrier methods by 141 patients (47%), intrauterine devices (IUDs) by two patients (1%), and no contraception by 17 patients (6%). The risk of developing gestational trophoblastic tumor was compared between patients using versus not using: OCs--33 versus 57% (P less than .001), barrier methods--53 versus 40% (P = .30), IUD--100 versus 46% (P = .21), and any contraceptive method--43 versus 88% (P less than .001). The dose of estrogens could be determined in 75 patients taking OCs; 14 of 49 (29%) of the patients taking less than 50 micrograms versus nine of 26 (35%) taking 50 micrograms or more developed gestational trophoblastic tumor (P = .78). Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the type of contraceptive used was the most important prognostic factor in gestational trophoblastic tumor development (P less than .0001), followed by the occurrence of theca-lutein cysts (P less than .0001), Asian maternal race (P = .02), lesser time from the last menstrual period (P = .005), and greater maternal age (P = .04). \nRemoval of massive right atrial thrombus guided by transesophageal echocardiography. Formation of massive right atrial thrombi around a peritoneovenous shunt is a known complication of these devices. Removal of an obstructive right atrial thrombus requires cardiopulmonary bypass and has been associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Transesophageal echocardiography was used in this case to diagnose and guide the surgical removal of a massive right atrial thrombus. \nAmikacin pharmacokinetics in patients receiving high-dose cancer chemotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed amikacin pharmacokinetics in 28 patients (mean age, 47.4 +/- 13.6 years) who received high-dose chemotherapy during a neutropenic febrile episode. Patients received an experimental protocol of high-dose anticancer chemotherapy. Amikacin pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from two or more concentrations in serum around a single dose by the method of Sawchuck and Zaske (J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 4:183-195, 1976). Predicted parameters were calculated by using standard methods. The observed amikacin volume of distribution and clearance were significantly greater and the elimination half-life was longer than predicted (0.38 +/- 0.13 versus 0.25 liter/kg [P = 0.0001], 1.51 +/- 0.92 versus 1.17 +/- 0.38 liters/h/kg [P = 0.012], and 3.8 +/- 2.4 versus 2.9 +/- 1.1 h [P = 0.011], respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that albumin correlated negatively and creatinine correlated positively with the volume of distribution and the elimination half-life. Creatinine and the percentage below the ideal body weight correlated negatively and hematocrit correlated positively with clearance. Administration of dosage regimens based on predicted pharmacokinetic parameters yielded subtherapeutic amikacin concentrations in serum in our patients. Because of the increased dosage requirements and the need for adequate antibiotic treatment in this population, we suggest guidelines for empiric dosing for patients with advanced cancer receiving intensive chemotherapy. \nAutoimmune Addison's disease and thyrotoxic thyroiditis presenting as encephalopathy in twins. An 11 year old boy who presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms including delirium and pronounced agitation was found to have simultaneous onset of autoimmune adrenocortical insufficiency and hyperthyroidism. His identical twin also had hyperthyroidism and six months later developed symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency. In children presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms, adrenal (or pituitary) and other endocrine disorders should be considered. \nTreatment of vasospasm with a 480-nm pulsed-dye laser. Laser energy at a wavelength of 480 nm was applied in 1-microseconds pulses of 3 to 10 mJ to two models of vasospasm. Rabbit common carotid arteries (CCA's) were constricted chronically by the application of human blood within a silicone sheath. Peak vasospasm developed 24 to 48 hours later, and persisted for up to 6 days. Endovascular laser treatment was delivered to 40 CCA's via a 200-microns diameter silica quartz fiber introduced through the femoral artery. The CCA caliber increased from 60% of the pre-vasospasm control diameter to a minimum post-laser diameter of 83% of control. No instances of laser-induced perforation or of arterial thrombosis were observed for up to 60 days after treatment. Prophylactic laser application to nine normal vessels was able to attenuate the development of vasospasm if blood was applied immediately thereafter (88% vs. 59% of control diameter, p less than 0.02), but not if blood was applied 7 days later. Studies in 16 normal CCA's established that there was a considerable margin between the laser energy required to induce dilatation and that which caused perforation, providing that the fiber remained relatively central within the artery. Morphological examination demonstrated focal loss of endothelial cells immediately after laser application, followed approximately 7 days later by the development of areas of intimal hyperplasia. Only minimal changes were observed in the medial or adventitial layers. In a second study, the basilar artery of seven dogs was constricted chronically by two intracisternal injections of autologous blood 3 days apart. Five dogs received endovascular laser treatment 7 or 10 days after the first injection, when basilar artery diameter was reduced to a mean of 61% and 77% of control, respectively. Immediately following treatment, basilar artery diameter increased to 104% and 102% of resting diameter, respectively. Both untreated and laser-treated arteries were smaller than the control diameter at 30 days (80% and 82%, respectively), but in each group the vasodilatory response to hypercapnia was preserved. These findings indicate that 1-microsecond laser pulses are well tolerated by systemic and cerebral arteries in two different animal models, and suggest that the 480-nm pulsed-dye laser may have an application for the treatment or prophylaxis of cerebral vasospasm. \nAcute reversible hypoxemia in systemic lupus erythematosus. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of unexplained reversible hypoxemia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and to assess the relation between hypoxemia and elevated plasma levels of complement split products. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient facilities of the New York University Medical Center/Bellevue Hospital and the Hospital for Joint Diseases. PATIENTS: Case patients were 22 patients hospitalized with disease exacerbation and no evidence of parenchymal lung disease on chest roentgenogram. Four patients with stable disease were followed in the outpatient clinic, and five healthy normal volunteers served as controls. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma levels of complement split products (C3a, factor Bb fragment), alveolar-arterial (A-a) Po2 gradients, and pulmonary function were measured. MAIN RESULTS: Nine episodes of hypoxemia or hypocapnia (mean A-a gradient, 30.4 +/- 4.8 mm Hg) or both (despite normal chest roentgenogram results) were noted in six hospitalized patients (group 1). Gas exchange improved within 72 hours of steroid therapy (mean A-a gradient, 11.6 +/- 4.3 mm Hg; P less than 0.01). These patients had an elevated initial mean C3a level (938.4 +/- 246.8 ng/mL) that decreased within 72 hours (407.8 +/- 80.9 ng/mL; P less than 0.01), concomitant with improved oxygenation. Ventilation-perfusion scans, obtained for four of six group 1 patients, excluded pulmonary emboli. Four hospitalized patients (group 2) had a normal A-a gradient (mean, 7.5 +/- 2.7 mm Hg). The mean C3a level of this group (358.3 +/- 39.2 ng/mL) was lower than that of group 1 (P less than 0.05). Four patients with stable disease (group 3) had a mean A-a gradient and a mean C3a level of 3.3 +/- 2.7 mm Hg and 237.8 +/- 105.7 ng/mL, respectively, similar to values found in five normal volunteers, in whom the mean A-a gradient was 3.7 +/- 1.7 mm Hg and the mean C3a level was 124.8 +/- 9.2 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: A syndrome of reversible hypoxemia, unassociated with parenchymal lung disease, is unexpectedly common in acutely ill, hospitalized patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is unclear, although the data are compatible with the hypothesis that hypoxemia may be related to pulmonary leukoaggregation. \nEnteral feeding as sole treatment for Crohn's disease: controlled trial of whole protein v amino acid based feed and a case study of dietary challenge. A controlled trial was performed to compare enteral feeding with either an amino acid based feed or a whole protein feed as sole treatment for active Crohn's disease. Twenty four patients were studied (nine with ileal, 11 with ileocolonic, and four with colonic disease). Both feeds proved effective; nine of 13 patients randomised to receive the amino acid based feed were in clinical remission within three weeks as defined by a simple activity index compared with eight of 11 treated with the whole protein feed. Patients in clinical remission were then crossed over onto the other feed. None of the six patients who were changed to the whole protein feed relapsed over the subsequent three week period compared with three of seven patients who were changed to the amino acid based feed. In responders the median serum C reactive protein concentration fell from 21 mg/l (range 9-82) on entry to 6 mg/l (range 3-19) at six weeks. Seven patients relapsed within eight months of starting solid food (mean 3.7 months), while nine were still in remission (follow up period 3-9 months, median six months). Detailed studies of staged reintroduction of food and permitted food additives were carried out over a four year period in a patient with extensive stricturing small bowel Crohn's disease who had been brought into remission by open treatment with enteral feeding. Carrageenan, other permitted emulsifiers, bread, meat, potatoes, oranges, refined sugar, dairy produce, flour, and rice were all reintroduced without any objective ill effect, but green vegetables provoked a clinical and biochemical relapse within one week of introduction. \nAn open-label study of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in severe childhood asthma. Eight pediatric patients with severe steroid-dependent asthma were enrolled in an open-label trial of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in an attempt to decrease their steroid requirements. Monthly therapy with high-dose IVIG resulted in a threefold decrease in both maintenance oral corticosteroid dose and in extra oral corticosteroids needed for control of exacerbations of asthma. This was accompanied by significant improvements in peak expiratory flow rates and in symptom-score rating. An immunomodulatory effect of IVIG was suggested by the changes in immediate skin test reactivity. Seven of the eight patients demonstrated one or more reactions to a panel of allergens before therapy. During the course of the trial, there was a progressive diminution in skin test reactivity with a 100-fold reduction in sensitivity at the completion of 6 months of therapy. In this preliminary study, the reduction in steroid requirements, improvement in symptoms and peak flow measurements, and diminution in immediate skin test reactivity support a potential role for IVIG in the treatment of severe steroid-dependent asthma. A larger, randomized trial now appears warranted. \nVenous thromboembolism after brain tumor surgery: a retrospective review. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence rate of clinical postoperative deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in 1703 patients undergoing initial craniotomy for meningioma, glioma, or cerebral metastasis. The incidence rate of clinical thromboembolic complications was 1.59% for all tumor groups within the first 4 weeks of surgery. Patients undergoing surgery for meningiomas had a statistically significant increased risk of thromboembolism despite fewer overall perioperative risk factors, when compared with the other tumor groups. The tumor-specific incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism for meningioma, glioma, and metastasis were 3.09%, 0.97%, and 1.03%, respectively. Whether this difference was a result of increased surgical time or an inherent property of meningiomas could not be ascertained. \nLoss of heterozygosity suggests multiple genetic alterations in pheochromocytomas and medullary thyroid carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific loci may help localize tumor suppressor genes involved in the formation of various familial and sporadic tumors. In addition, the genetic loci for a number of familial tumor syndromes have been mapped by linkage analysis. To explore the possible role of tumor suppressor genes in endocrine tumors, we tested 41 pheochromocytomas (34 sporadic and 7 familial) and 11 medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) (10 sporadic and 1 familial) for LOH near a variety of potentially important genetic loci: (a) the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) locus on chromosome 10; (b) the von Hippel-Lindau locus on 3p; and (c) the p53 and neurofibromatosis 1 loci on 17. We also examined chromosomes 1p and 22q because previous studies in a small number of pheochromocytomas and MTCs suggested LOH in these regions. Background rates for LOH were assessed using several \"random\" probes. Finally, we examined a number of clinical and histologic characteristics of these tumors for possible correlations with specific genetic alterations. LOH in the region of the MEN 2A locus was uncommon (0% for MTCs, 5% for pheochromocytomas). However, we found significant allelic losses in pheochromocytomas on chromosomes 1p (42%), 3p (16%), 17p (24%), and 22q (31%). We also noted a correlation between LOH on 1p and urinary excretion of metanephrine by these patients (P = 0.02). LOH on 1p, 3p, and 17p also appeared to be associated with increased tumor volume. Analysis of the smaller number of MTCs demonstrated allelic losses on chromosomes 1p and 22q. Our results suggest that tumor formation and/or progression in pheochromocytomas and MTCs involves multiple genes, analogous with the model proposed for colon carcinoma. \nAnaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Immunocytochemical study of 32 cases. To study the histogenesis of and determine the most useful markers for diagnosing anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), 32 cases, including 2 with numerous osteoclast-like cells, were stained with a battery of antibodies to epithelial (keratin, epithelial membrane antigen [EMA], carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]), mesenchymal (vimentin, desmin, muscle-specific actin [MSA], Factor VIII-related antigen [FVIII:RAg]), endocrine (thyroglobulin, calcitonin, chromogranin [Cg]), lymphocytic (leukocyte common antigen [LCA]), histiocytic (alpha-1-antitrypsin [alpha 1AT], alpha-1-antichymotrypsin [alpha 1AChy], KP1), melanocytic (HMB-45), and Schwann cell (S-100 protein) markers. Five tumors were associated with papillary carcinoma. In one of these cases, a morphologic continuum between the well-differentiated carcinoma and the ATC was visualized by their positive immunostaining for both vimentin and keratin, thus supporting the hypothesis that the latter tumor originated from the former. Twenty-five (78.1%) tumors expressed keratin, 10 (31.3%) reacted for EMA, and 3 (9.4%) expressed CEA, confirming the epithelial nature of this neoplasm. Reactivity for thyroglobulin was seen in a small number of cells in five (15.6%) thyroglobulin was seen in a small number of cells in five (15.6%) ATCs. Because all of the cases that expressed keratin also stained positively for EMA, CEA, or thyroglobulin, it is believed that keratin is the most useful epithelial marker for diagnosis of ATC. A lack of reactivity for calcitonin and Cg indicates that these tumors are not derived from C cells, as has been proposed by some authors. Reactivity for KP1 (CD68), a monoclonal antibody that reacts with a macrophage-associated antigen, occurred in the osteoclast-like cells but not in the anaplastic tumor cells. This finding, together with negative keratin staining of the osteoclast-like cells, indicates that these cells are not epithelial in nature and therefore should be considered reactive rather than neoplastic. Thirty tumors (93.8%) expressed vimentin, 15 (46.9%) marked for alpha 1AChy, 11 (34.4%) exhibited alpha 1AT, and 11 (34.4%) expressed S-100 protein. Because all of these markers can be seen in a wide variety of tumors of different histogeneses, they have no value in the diagnosis of ATC. Although immunostaining for FVIII:RAg, desmin, and MSA was negative in all of these tumors, these markers can help to differentiate between ATCs and some soft tissue sarcomas with which they can be confused. \nAcute appendicitis following blunt abdominal trauma. Incidence or coincidence? Inflammation of the appendix is a common cause of acute abdominal pain. The etiology and pathophysiology of appendicitis have been well described. The initiating factor often is obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by inspissated stool, barium, food, parasites, or hyperplastic lymphoid tissue. Two patients have been identified who developed appendicitis temporally related to blunt abdominal trauma, without other clear etiology. Although absolute documentation of trauma as an etiologic factor in these cases is difficult, theoretical mechanisms for the occurrence are discussed. In the setting of right lower quadrant pain following mild to moderate blunt abdominal trauma, acute appendicitis should be considered as a possibility. \nContinuous interleukin-2 and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as treatment of advanced melanoma. A national biotherapy study group trial. Melanoma metastases were harvested from 82 patients for the purpose of growing and expanding tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Tumor tissue cell suspensions were incubated with interleukin-2 (IL-2), followed by repeated exposure to tumor antigen with or without OKT3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb). Initial growth success was achieved in 56 of 82 cultures (72%). Efforts were made to expand 26 of these 56 cultures for therapeutic TIL; 23 of 26 early cultures (88%) were successfully expanded for in vivo therapy. It took a mean of 78.5 +/- 25.4 days to grow sufficient TIL for treatment. Therapy included cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2) on day 1, followed by a 96-hour continuous infusion of IL-2 (18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d) on days 2 to 5, and approximately 10(11) (mean 1.49 +/- 0.93 x 10(11)) TIL on day 2. Patients who responded received monthly IL-2 as a 96-hour infusion. Median patient age was 45 years of age. Sixty-seven percent of the patients were men. Performance status was 0 to 1 in 77% of patients. Thirty-four percent of the patients had liver metastases. The usual IL-2 toxicities were seen. Response rate for 21 patients was 24% (95% confidence interval, 10% to 49%). One complete response was achieved with cells 98% CD4+; four partial responses were achieved with cells 80%, 94%, 98%, and 98% CD8+, respectively. Four of eight patients who received TIL, which had never been stimulated with OKT3, had tumor response. The authors conclude that a treatment plan for IL-2/TIL is technically difficult, costly, and effective for only a minority of patients. Overall, clinical results are not clearly superior to those obtained with other IL-2 regimens. \nSomatosensory function following dorsal root entry zone lesions in patients with neurogenic pain or spasticity. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning procedure, microsurgical DREZ-otomy (MDT), on spinal cord somatosensory function based on peri- and intraoperative clinical and electrophysiological data. The study was performed prospectively on a series of 20 patients suffering from either chronic neurogenic pain or spasticity. Physiological observations were made of the intraoperative evoked electrospinographic recordings as collected from the surface of the spinal cord. The MDT procedure produced analgesia or severe hypalgesia, moderate hypesthesia, and only slight deficits in proprioception and cutaneous spatial discrimination on the body segments operated on. These clinical data correlated well with evoked electrospinographic recordings, which showed a moderate effect of MDT on presynaptic compound action potentials recorded from the spinal cord (N11 and N21), a partial or even reversible effect on the cortical postcentral N20 wave, a more marked effect on the postsynaptic dorsal horn waves N13 and N24 related to large primary afferent fibers, and a disappearance of dorsal horn waves related to finer afferents (N2 and possibly N3). These data provide evidence for an acceptably selective action of MDT on spinal cord nociceptive mechanisms, and for a partial, often slight, involvement of the other somatosensory domains. The presence of abnormal evoked electrospinographic waves is discussed in relation to the mechanisms of neurogenic pain and spasticity. The hypothesis of a \"retuning\" of the dorsal horn as the mode of action of MDT is presented. \nA prospective study of aspirin use and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women OBJECTIVE. The aim of the study was to examine prospectively the association between regular aspirin use and the risk of a first myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events in women. DESIGN. Prospective cohort study including 6 years of follow-up. SETTING. Registered nurses residing in 11 US states. PARTICIPANTS. US registered nurses (n = 87,678) aged 34 to 65 years and free of diagnosed coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer at baseline. Followup was 96.7% of total potential person-years of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, and all important vascular events. RESULTS. During 475,265 person-years of follow-up, we documented 240 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 146 nonfatal strokes, and 130 deaths due to cardiovascular disease (total, 516 important vascular events). Among women who reported taking one through six aspirin per week, the age-adjusted relative risk (RR) of a first myocardial infarction was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.89; P = .005), as compared with those women who took no aspirin. After simultaneous adjustment for risk factors for coronary disease, the RR was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.99; P = .04). For women aged 50 years and older, the age-adjusted RR was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84; P = .002) and the multivariate RR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.93; P = .02). We observed no alteration in the risk of stroke (multivariate RR = 0.99; P = .94). The multivariate RR of cardiovascular death was 0.89 (P = .56) and of important vascular events was 0.85 (P = .12). When examined separately, the results were nearly identical for the subgroups who took one through three and four through six aspirin per week. Among women who took seven or more aspirin per week, there were no apparent reductions in risk. CONCLUSIONS. The use of one through six aspirin per week appears to be associated with a reduced risk of a first myocardial infarction among women. A randomized trial in women is necessary, however, to provide conclusive data on the role of aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women. \nNational High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy This consensus report focuses the presentation, pathophysiology, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy expanding on recommendations first presented in 1988 by the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Practicing physicians should determine whether a patient's hypertension during pregnancy falls into the classification of (1) chronic hypertension, (2) preeclampsia, (3) preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, or (4) transient hypertension. The distinction, for management considerations, is made between hypertension that is present before pregnancy (chronic and preexisting) and that occurring as part of the pregnancy-specific condition preeclampsia. When maternal blood pressure reaches diastolic levels of 100 mm Hg or greater, treatment should be instituted to avoid hypertensive vascular damage. The report includes a discussion of antihypertensive therapy specific to the chronic or acute hypertension occurring concomitantly with pregnancy. The roles of calcium supplementation and low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia and chronic and transient hypertension are under investigation. \nGloboid cell leukodystrophy: a family with both late-infantile and adult type. We present a patient with adult-onset globoid cell leukodystrophy (GBL) who had almost complete deficiency of galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase. A brother of the index patient deteriorated neurologically and died at the age of 4, probably from the late-infantile form of the disease. In this family, two clinical types of GBL are probably different expressions of an identical genotype. \nElimination of clonogenic breast cancer cells from human bone marrow. A comparison of immunotoxin treatment with chemoimmunoseparation using 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, monoclonal antibodies, and magnetic microspheres. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) may aid in the management of breast cancer, but is currently limited to patients without bone marrow metastases. In earlier studies, 5 logs of malignant clonogenic breast cancer cells could be eliminated from human bone marrow using a combination of chemoseparation with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) and immunoseparation with monoclonal antibodies and magnetic microspheres. In this report the authors compare chemoimmunoseparation to treatment with immunotoxins for elimination of tumor cells from human bone marrow and for the preservation of normal precursors. Breast cancer cells from each of five cell lines were mixed with a tenfold excess of irradiated human bone marrow cells. Treatment with a combination of five immunotoxins reduced clonogenic tumor cell growth by 1.8 to 5.5 logs depending upon the cell line. With two of the five cell lines, clonogenic tumor cells were eliminated quantitatively. Using the CAMA-1 breast cancer cell line, treatment with multiple immunotoxins was compared with chemoimmunoseparation with 4-HC, a panel of five unconjugated monoclonal antibodies and magnetic microspheres. Chemoimmunoseparation eliminated 3.5 to 5.4 logs of malignant cells, while preserving 21% of Colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and 37% of burst-forming unit-erythrocyte (BFU-E). No clonogenic breast cancer cells could be detected. Immunotoxin treatment eliminated 2.2 to 5.4 logs of clonogenic breast cancer cells, but had no effect on the bone marrow precursors. In seven of ten experiments, however, clonogenic breast cancer cells remained after immunotoxin treatment. Consequently, treatment with 4-HC, multiple murine monoclonal antibodies and magnetic microspheres provided more consistent elimination of tumor cells than separation with immunotoxins, but was significantly more toxic for marrow precursors. \nLow-back pain in adolescent athletes: detection of stress injury to the pars interarticularis with SPECT. The authors reviewed 1 year of experience with planar and single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) bone scintigraphy in 162 young patients with symptoms of low-back pain possibly related to stress injury to the pars interarticularis or spondylolysis. Planar scintigraphy and SPECT revealed no abnormality in 91 patients (56%). All abnormalities detected on planar images were also detectable with SPECT. SPECT showed an abnormal focus of radiotracer uptake in the lumbar spine in 71 patients (44%). In 32 of these 71 patients, these findings were also evident with planar scintigraphy. In 39 of these 71 patients, use of SPECT. Correlation with contemporaneous radiographs was made in 72 cases (including computed tomography in 10 cases). SPECT can be used to detect stress injury not seen with planar bone imaging or radiography and is recommended in evaluation of low-back pain in young athletes. \nSucralfate retention enemas in solitary rectal ulcer. The conservative treatment of solitary rectal ulcer is generally unsatisfactory. Six patients, aged 27-54 years, with recurrent solitary rectal ulcer were treated with topical administration of sucralfate in a daily dose of 2 g twice a day for 6 weeks. Four patients experienced complete relief of symptoms and the remaining two patients had marked improvement. Although macroscopic healing of the ulcer was apparent in all, histologic improvement was not appreciable. Five of the six patients remain in remission during a follow-up period of 4-14 months (mean, 8 +/- 1.5 months). Recurrence was observed in one patient at 5 months, which satisfactorily resolved with sucralfate enemas. From these preliminary observations we infer that solitary rectal ulcer can be effectively treated with topical application of sucralfate. \nRelation between mixed venous oxygen saturation and cardiac index. Nonlinearity and normalization for oxygen uptake and hemoglobin. The ability of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) monitoring to reflect changes in cardiac index (CI) with therapy in critically ill patients is unclear. To this end, SvO2 and CI were measured before and during an infusion of enoximone and/or dobutamine in 30 patients with advanced heart failure. A nonlinear relationship was observed between SvO2 and CI with the nonlinear correlation coefficient being 0.52. On normalizing for individual differences in hemoglobin and oxygen consumption, this correlation coefficient became 0.90. Further analysis of individual data was performed using linear regression, and the slopes and correlation coefficients were found to span a wide range slope: -10.0 to 30.9 min-m2/L, r: -0.27 to 0.99). However, the mean slope and correlation coefficient for patients with baseline CI and SvO2 less than 21/min/m2 and less than 55 percent were 18.3 min-m2/L and 0.87, respectively, while those for the remainder of patients were only 3.1 min-m2/L and 0.42, respectively. Thus, the nonlinear correlation coefficient of the SvO2-CI relationship in a group of patients is dependent on the homogeneity of their oxygen consumption and hemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, the ability of SvO2 to serve as a therapeutic indicator in any given patient is dependent on baseline SvO2 and CI. \nIntra-arterial thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia. A group of 54 patients with acute or chronic limb ischaemia were initially treated with low dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy using streptokinase (10,000 units h-1) or plasminogen activator (0.5 mg h-1). Complete thrombolysis was obtained in 90 per cent of patients with symptoms of less than 1 week duration, and in 50 per cent with symptoms of greater than 1 week (P less than 0.05). Successful lysis in 36 patients was followed by successful bypass surgery in seven, percutaneous angioplasty in 13, no further treatment in 13, repeat thrombolysis in two and amputation in one. Failed therapy was associated with major amputation in 40 per cent. One patient died of haemorrhage and another of stroke as a direct result of thrombolytic treatment. The most common complication was haematoma at the site of cannulation of the vessel. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy can be very useful for the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia, but complications do occur and patients should be carefully selected. \nComparison of the effects of ureteral calculosis and occlusion on muscular sensitivity to painful stimulation in rats. An animal model of muscular hyperalgesia was developed. In humans, this disorder follows painful crises due to ureteral calculosis. Changes in vocalization thresholds to electrical stimulation of the obliquus externus muscle of both sides were studied in a group of rats with chronically implanted muscles before and after the production of a stone in one ureter. In another group of rats with implanted muscles, it had been verified preliminarily that these thresholds did not vary widely from day to day. On the contrary, a significant lowering in threshold (max 31%) in the muscle ipsilateral to the implanted ureter appeared the day after the production of the stone and persisted for the subsequent 10 days of observation, although less pronounced during the last 5 days. Hypersensitivity to manual pressure was also observed, mainly in the ipsilateral muscle, in most rats during the same period. In order to differentiate between the effects due to the presence of the stone in the ureteral lumen and those due to the spontaneous occlusion which frequently occurred in the implanted ureter, 2 other groups of rats were studied. In one, a unilateral ureteral ligature was performed; in the other, the production of a stone was combined with a ligature (placed distally to the stone). Ligature alone never induced any hyperalgesic effect. Stone plus ligature produced a marked hyperalgesia (max 39%) in the ipsilateral muscle, which lasted for only 5 days. It is concluded that the ureteral stone is the factor responsible for the appearance of muscular hyperalgesia. \nGenetic aspects of admissions to a paediatric intensive care unit. Of 821 consecutive admissions to a paediatric intensive care unit, 47 (5.7%) were for chromosomal or monogenic disorders. These patients had more readmissions, longer mean stays, and a higher mortality rate than the group as a whole. In two of the four cases that died of single gene disorders, failure to store DNA made genetic counseling difficult. \nLate follow-up of carotid endarterectomy with venous patch angioplasty. Ninety carotid endarterectomies with venous patch angioplasty were performed in 83 patients between July 1980 and December 1985. The primary indication for patching was a small-caliber internal carotid artery (ICA) with a diameter less than 3.0 mm in 54 arteriotomies (60%). Patency of the endarterectomy was evaluated by completion arteriography in all instances. Follow-up was conducted after an intermediate postoperative period of 21 +/- 12.5 months in 69 sides by arteriography. A late follow-up was conducted at 55.4 +/- 11.2 months either by arteriography (in 45 sides) or by carotid duplex scanning (in 11 sides). Twenty-one patients with 23 endarterectomies died, only 1 of a cerebral event. Seven patients moved or refused study and five were lost to follow-up. Three recurrent stenoses and five carotid occlusions developed by the time of the intermediate follow-up. By the time of late follow-up, three additional patients developed recurrent stenoses. Our results suggest that recurrent stenosis continues to develop with a longer period of follow-up in patients undergoing venous patch angioplasty with carotid endarterectomy. \nHeadaches due to cerebrovascular disease. Subarachnoid hemorrhage causes sudden, severe headache and requires immediate medical and surgical diagnosis and treatment. A CT scan is the first choice for correct diagnosis. In order to prevent rebleeding, delays in treatment should be avoided. Intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage is now often recognized by means of CT scanning and sometimes is a cause of headache. Cerebellar hemorrhage commonly causes occipital headache and is an indication for immediate surgical intervention, although small cerebellar hemorrhages can be treated conservatively. Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is frequently accompanied by headache, but its etiology remains uncertain. Thrombosis of the cerebrovenous system is a less frequent cause of head pain than that of the arterial system, but it usually shows characteristic neurologic signs. Following carotid endarterectomy or superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass surgery, the patient may have moderate to severe unilateral headaches, probably as a result of platelet aggregation and serotonin release. \nSodium and volume sensitivity of blood pressure. Age and pressure change over time. Salt sensitivity has been implicated in the age-related increase in blood pressure. We studied the reproducibility of a rapid method for assessing sodium sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure as well as the effect of age on this phenomenon. Blood pressure after volume expansion with 2 l intravenous saline (0.9%) over 4 hours was compared with that after 1 day of 10 mmol sodium chloride intake and 3 and 40 mg oral doses of furosemide. Normal and hypertensive subjects (n = 28) were studied twice within a year. Cross-sectional observations of the effect of age were made from studies in 230 hypertensive and 430 normotensive subjects. Longitudinal observations of blood pressure change over time were made 10 or more years after categorization of sodium responsivity in 31 subjects. The blood pressure response was reproducible in 28 subjects studied twice (r = 0.56, p less than 0.002). Four subjects changed salt-responsiveness status and six were indeterminate on restudy. Sodium sensitivity of blood pressure increased significantly with increasing age in the entire population (n = 660, r = -0.38, p less than 0.001). The relation was more striking in hypertensive subjects (n = 230, r = -0.31, p less than 0.001) in whom a progressive increase in salt sensitivity with decades was seen than in the normotensive group (n = 430, r = -0.19, p less than 0.01) in whom salt sensitivity was not observed until the sixth decade. Salt-sensitive subjects had a significantly greater increase in systolic (p less than 0.001) and diastolic (p less than 0.01) pressure over time than those who were salt-resistant. Salt sensitivity is a reproducible phenomenon that is related to the age-associated increase in blood pressure characteristic of industrialized societies. In addition, salt sensitivity can be shown to be a predictor of subsequent, age-related blood pressure increase. \nAztreonam in the treatment of gram-negative bacterial meningitis. Aztreonam was administered to 122 patients with presumptive or confirmed gram-negative bacillary meningitis in an open, multinational study. The antibiotic was administered at a dosage of 1-2 g to adults, 50 mg/kg to children greater than 2 years old, and 30 mg/kg to infants three or four times daily. Seventy-seven patients had microbiologically confirmed gram-negative meningitis due to an aztreonam-susceptible organism and received aztreonam for at least 48 hours. Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequently recovered pathogen (40 patients), followed by Enterobacteriaceae (16 patients), Neisseria meningitidis (15 patients), and Pseudomonas species (six patients). All but four patients were microbiologically cured. Microbiologic failure was associated with either a persistent intracerebral abscess (one patient) or a foreshortened course of therapy before microbiologic reevaluation and death (at 48 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after initiation of treatment, respectively). These data suggest that aztreonam is effective in the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis caused by susceptible organisms. \nThe clinical significance and pathophysiology of stress-related gastric mucosal hemorrhage. Critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) develop a spectrum of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions that may result in mucosal hemorrhage and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Although stress-related mucosal lesions may be detected endoscopically in most critically ill patients, the incidence of clinically significant bleeding from these lesions is difficult to establish because of the heterogeneity in patient populations, the definitions of bleeding, and the methods of monitoring in various studies. Bleeding occurs overall in approximately 16% of patients not receiving prophylaxis, but the incidence of life-threatening hemorrhage appears to be much lower (less than 6%). In light of the increasing use of pharmacologic prophylaxis in ICUs, the clinical impact of stress-related bleeding and its prophylaxis is discussed in terms of bleeding incidence, morbidity and mortality, cost, and potential side effects. The pathophysiology of stress-related mucosal ulceration involves the complex interaction of gastric luminal factors, alterations in blood flow and intramucosal pH, and alterations in numerous factors that are normally responsible for maintaining an intact mucosa. The pathophysiology of stress ulceration is discussed, with an emphasis on cause-and-effect relationships, evolving areas of investigation, and implications for prophylaxis and treatment. \nCervical paraganglioma with subsequent intracranial and intraspinal metastases. Case report. Paragangliomas, tumors derived from the extra-adrenal paraganglion system, have commonly been found in the retroperitoneum, abdomen, mediastinum, skull base, and neck. Rare intraspinal cases have included involvement of the cauda equina and filum terminale, and a recent case has been reported of thoracic cord paraganglioma with metastasis to the cauda equina. The authors present the case of a patient with a cervical paraganglioma who underwent subtotal resection followed by postoperative irradiation; she subsequently developed multiple intracranial and intraspinal metastases 7 months following the first decompression procedure. \nComparison of different antibiotic regimens for therapy of 32 cases of Q fever endocarditis. We studied 32 cases of Q fever endocarditis diagnosed in France between January 1985 and December 1989 to evaluate the efficacies of the different regimens of antibiotics used for treatment. Each patient was monitored during the treatment (range, 12 to 60 months), and clinical and biological information was computerized. Various treatments were prescribed, including doxycycline alone (9 cases) or in association with rifampin (4 cases), quinolones (16 cases), or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (1 case). Two patients died before the beginning of the treatment. Nineteen patients had hemodynamic failure and subsequently underwent valve replacement. Nine valve tissue cultures were positive despite previous antibiotic treatment. In terms of their effects on mortality, the difference between doxycycline alone and doxycycline plus quinolones is statistically significant. We conclude that the addition of quinolones to doxycycline is beneficial. On the basis of clinical, serological, and valve tissue culture results, no treatment was able to cure Q fever endocarditis within 2 years, even with a combination of antibiotics. We advise a minimum duration of treatment of 3 years with therapy combining quinolones and doxycycline. \nHow prevalent is cancer family syndrome? Based on an established but pragmatic definition of cancer family syndrome as the presence of three or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer in a first degree kinship, the contribution of this syndrome to the total cancer burden in Northern Ireland has been studied by investigating all non-polyposis probands under 55 years old at histological diagnosis between 1976 and 1978. Family interviews were possible for 95% (n = 205) of all non-polyposis probands and verification of vital status or medical history was obtained for 98% of 1811 first degree relatives. The prevalence of cancer family syndrome was between 1 and 2%, a figure some fivefold less than that estimated elsewhere. A proximal tumour excess was not characteristic of the ascertained families. These results may have implications for the identification of susceptible people if screening for high risk groups is considered a worthwhile option for reducing colorectal cancer mortality in the United Kingdom. \nPercutaneous transjugular portosystemic shunt. OBJECTIVE.--To determine the effectiveness of the Palmaz balloon expandable stent for the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The device is designed to achieve portal decompression in patients with variceal hemorrhage secondary to portal hypertension. DESIGN.--Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting was performed in eight patients during a 9-month period. Mean follow-up was 5 months. PATIENTS.--All patients had cirrhosis with portal hypertension and varices. Bleeding occurred in seven patients from esophageal varices and in one patient from hemorrhoids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Shunt patency and recurrent variceal hemorrhage. RESULTS.--Shunts created from a transjugular approach between a hepatic and a portal vein (diameters of 8 to 12 mm) lowered the average portosystemic pressure gradient from 36 to 11 mm Hg. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.7 days. Complete variceal decompression after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement was identified endoscopically in all eight patients. The patient treated for hemorrhoids rebled and was treated successfully by transfemoral balloon expansion of the shunt diameter from 8 to 12 mm. All shunts were patent at 1 to 9 months (mean, 5 months) of follow-up. CONCLUSION.--Initial results suggest that transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is a safe and effective method of portal decompression for the treatment of variceal hemorrhage. \nEffects of dietary Ca2+ on erythrocyte Na(+)-transport systems in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 1. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of dietary Ca2+ intake on blood pressure and erythrocyte Na+ transport in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 2. Spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats were fed diets with three different Ca2+ contents, 0.1% (low-Ca2+ diet), 0.6% (normal-Ca2+ diet) and 4.0% (high-Ca2+ diet), between 6 and 20 weeks of age. At 20 weeks of age, the levels of erythrocyte Na+ efflux, as well as Na+ and K+ contents in erythrocytes, were measured. 3. On the low-Ca2+ diet, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed an enhancement of hypertension. Conversely, on the high-Ca2+ diet, they showed an attenuation of the increase in blood pressure. Spontaneously hypertensive rats had a lower erythrocyte Na+ content and increased activity of the Na+ pump at higher levels of dietary Ca2+. Passive Na+ permeability and Na(+)-K+ co-transport were similar in spontaneously hypertensive rats on the low-, normal- and high-Ca2+ diets. There were no significant differences in blood pressure and in Na+ pump activity in WKY on the three different diets. 4. It is concluded that dietary Ca2+ might affect the regulation of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats by changing the activity of Na+ pump in the cell membrane. \nIncidence and characteristics of preventable iatrogenic cardiac arrests We studied the contribution of iatrogenic illness to cardiac arrest among patients hospitalized in 1981 in a university teaching hospital. During this 1-year period, 28 (14%) of 203 arrests in which resuscitation was attempted followed an iatrogenic complication. Seventeen (61%) of the 28 patients died. The demographic characteristics of patients with iatrogenic arrest did not differ strikingly from those of other patients who arrested. However, patients with iatrogenic arrest were less likely to be in cardiogenic shock or to have suffered an acute myocardial infarction prior to arrest. They were more likely to survive to discharge from the hospital and to be taking digoxin or antiarrhythmic medication prior to arrest. Among the 28 cases of iatrogenic cardiac arrest, 18 (9% of all arrests) might have been prevented by stricter attention to the patient's history, findings on physical examination, and laboratory data. The most common causes of potentially preventable arrest were medication errors and toxic effects (44%) as well as suboptimal response by physicians to clinical signs and symptoms (28%), most frequently dyspnea and tachypnea. Rapid, appropriate response to abnormal drug levels, to electrocardiographic signs of adverse drug effects, and to signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure or toxic effects from digoxin might decrease the incidence of cardiac arrest among hospitalized patients. \nNutritional support of patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. Malnutrition is extremely common in patients with malignant disease. Whereas the causes are multifactorial, the predominant factor is the imbalance between nutrient intake and host nutrient requirements. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that cachexia is related to abnormal changes in host intermediary metabolism induced by host-tumor interactions, and endogenous peptides such as TNF may be important mediators. The role of nutritional therapy in cancer patients remains to be defined. Clearly, patients with severe malnutrition benefit from nutritional intervention. However, the benefit of nutritional therapy in less severe cases of malnutrition as an adjuvant to oncologic therapy has yet to be established. \nAge-related normal values of signal-averaged electrocardiographic variables after acute myocardial infarction. The study examined standard time domain variables of a signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) in 328 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. The correlation of these variables with age and the influence of age on the prediction of postinfarction arrhythmic complication (sudden death [n = 12] or sustained ventricular tachycardia, or both [n = 14]) from the SAECG were investigated. Statistically highly significant correlations (p less than or equal to 0.00002) between age and SAECG variables were found. Compared with patients aged less than 60 years, the SAECG-based stratification of arrhythmic complications after myocardial infarction in patients greater than 60 years had lower sensitivity for the same values of specificity and lower specificity for the same values of sensitivity. \nFactors influencing the outcome of congenital heart disease detected prenatally. The diagnosis of structural heart disease before birth is associated with a poor prognosis. Of 222 continuing pregnancies seen in a 10 year period, there has been a 79% mortality. This is inconsistent with published results and current concepts of the outcome for children with cardiac malformation. Of the 222, death occurred in intrauterine life in 57, 87 died as neonates, and 31 in infancy or childhood. There are 47 survivors of whom only five have survived beyond 4 years. Factors influencing the outcome in these cases were examined further. A high mortality was associated with the presence of extracardiac anomalies in 71 (32%) and prenatal cardiac failure in 28 (13%). As many patients were referred for these reasons, referral methods preferentially select patients with a different range of heart disease from that seen postnatally. In addition, some forms of heart disease progress in severity during fetal life. Those involved in the management and counselling after diagnosis of heart disease in early pregnancy must be aware of the additional prenatal factors influencing prognosis and allow for them in making predictions of outcome. \nProliferation of endocrine cells in the rat stomach caused by drug-induced achlorhydria. Time-related changes of serum gastrin levels, gastrin cell, and enterochromaffinlike cell densities, and proliferation kinetics of these cells have been examined in rats during treatment with the substituted benzimidazole BY 308 over a period of 73 days. Serum gastrin levels increased very rapidly from 74 +/- 6 pg/mL (controls) to 438 +/- 31 pg/mL (day 1) and 727 +/- 68 pg/mL (day 4). Thereafter, a steady increase was observed until day 70 (2097 +/- 208 pg/mL). Enterochromaffinlike cell density was unchanged until day 10, but then increased progressively without reaching a plateau (144% above control on day 73). The labeling index of these cells was enhanced shortly after drug application and remained on a constant elevated level from day 14 to day 73 (about 10-fold to 12-fold above controls from day 14 to day 70). The number of gastrin cells increased rapidly within the first week and reached a plateau after 17 days (96% increase above controls). In contrast to enterochromaffinlike cells, the labeling index did not change immediately but increased on day 7 by 37% and returned beneath control values after day 28. The results suggest that in drug-induced achlorhydria, the progressive increase of enterochromaffinlike cells is explained by an enhanced mitosis, whereas other factors in addition to proliferation are responsible for the augmentation of gastrin cells. \nIndependent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in French drinkers. The aim of this study was to assess whether markers of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection are independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in drinkers after adjustment for three known risk factors: cirrhosis, age and male sex. Among 2,015 consecutive drinkers admitted, hepatitis C virus antibodies were found by sensitive radioimmunoassay in 1,259. The following five factors have been identified and ranked as risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in unidimensional and regression analysis: cirrhosis (p less than 0.001), age (p less than 0.001), male sex (p less than 0.001), presence of HBsAg (p less than 0.001) and presence of hepatitis C virus antibodies (p less than 0.03). Among drinkers with cirrhosis, the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were older (64 +/- 11 yr vs. 56 +/- 9 yr; p less than 0.001), were more often male (93% vs. 65%; p less than 0.0001) and had higher prevalence of HBsAg (9% vs. 2%; p = 0.02) and hepatitis C virus antibodies (41% vs. 26%; p = 0.02). A simple algorithm permitted us to identify a high-risk population of drinkers: the male cirrhotic patient older than 50 yr. The relative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in this selected population was 17.7 (95% confidence interval = 9.0 to 37.5; p less than 0.0001). From a pragmatic point of view, the detection of HBsAg or hepatitis C virus antibodies, although independently associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, is not useful in increasing the diagnostic value of this algorithm because of the poor sensitivity of these tests. The weak relationships observed between hepatitis C virus antibodies and hepatocellular carcinoma needs confirmation by more accurate tests. \nAntiphospholipid antibodies in cerebral ischemia. In a 2-year prospective study of 146 patients with cerebral ischemia, we compared vascular risk factors for stroke with clinical and laboratory findings, particularly antiphospholipid antibodies. Ten patients (6.8%) were positive for at least one antiphospholipid antibody; one patient had systemic lupus erythematosus, one had rheumatoid arthritis, and the remaining eight fulfilled criteria for the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome. These patients were predominantly male, not necessarily young, and 50% of them did not have any other vascular risk factors; there were no significant clinical or paraclinical differences between these patients and those without antiphospholipid antibodies. Outcome in the 10 patients was good, and platelet antiaggregating drugs proved to be useful in preventing further cerebrovascular ischemic events in our patients. \nRectosigmoid varices and other mucosal changes in patients with portal hypertension. A prospective study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of anorectal varices and their clinical significance as well as to study other proctosigmoidoscopic changes in 75 patients with portal hypertension of diverse etiology. Sixty-seven patients (89.3%) had lower gastrointestinal varices with no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in prevalence between cirrhosis (92.1%), noncirrhotic portal fibrosis (87%), and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (85.7%). The rectum was the most common site of lower gastrointestinal varices. External anal and sigmoid colonic varices almost always occurred in the presence of rectal and/or internal anal varices. There was no correlation between the presence of rectosigmoid varices and the severity of esophagogastric mucosal changes or portal hypertension. There was no suggestion that esophageal variceal sclerotherapy influenced the presence of anorectal varices. Seven patients (9.3%) had recent hematochezia, including three patients in whom it occurred in the absence of any upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Varices were the cause of bleeding in at least five patients. An abnormal mucosal vascular pattern in the form of telangiectasias or spiders was seen, irrespective of etiology of portal hypertension, in nine patients (12%). Hemorrhoids were present in 31 patients (41.3%) with an age-related difference (p less than 0.05) between patients with cirrhosis (55.3%) and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (21.4%). \nRevascularization of infarcted myocardium. Effect on myocardial perfusion assessed with quantified Tl-201 SPECT technique. Myocardial perfusion was studied in 21 patients before and after revascularization of all graftable stenotic vessels following post-infarction anteroapical akinesia and minor dyskinesia. At preoperative and late postoperative evaluation, perfusion abnormalities in identified sectors were quantified with two methods, one (Q1) assessing the extent and the other (Q3) the severity of abnormal perfusion. The preoperative scores with both methods indicated permanent myocardial perfusion defects in all 21 patients and reversible defects, indicating myocardial ischemia, in 16 with Q1 and 14 with Q3. After bypass grafting there was overall reduction of myocardial perfusion defect and of abnormality scores: Notably, 13/21 patients (62%) had decreased permanent myocardial defect score, reflecting reactivation of 'hibernating myocardium'. The findings indicated that obstructed but graftable vessels supplying myocardium with loss of contractile function should be bypassed, since flow contribution to distant, viable myocardium is probable via preserved collateral circulation. This should be particularly relevant for the LAD, because of that artery's septal branches. \nAtrial fibrillation as an independent risk factor for stroke: the Framingham Study. The impact of nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on stroke incidence was examined in 5,070 participants in the Framingham Study after 34 years of follow-up. Compared with subjects free of these conditions, the age-adjusted incidence of stroke was more than doubled in the presence of coronary heart disease (p less than 0.001) and more than trebled in the presence of hypertension (p less than 0.001). There was a more than fourfold excess of stroke in subjects with cardiac failure (p less than 0.001) and a near fivefold excess when atrial fibrillation was present (p less than 0.001). In persons with coronary heart disease or cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation doubled the stroke risk in men and trebled the risk in women. With increasing age the effects of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on the risk of stroke became progressively weaker (p less than 0.05). Advancing age, however, did not reduce the significant impact of atrial fibrillation. For persons aged 80-89 years, atrial fibrillation was the sole cardiovascular condition to exert an independent effect on stroke incidence (p less than 0.001). The attributable risk of stroke for all cardiovascular contributors decreased with age except for atrial fibrillation, for which the attributable risk increased significantly (p less than 0.01), rising from 1.5% for those aged 50-59 years to 23.5% for those aged 80-89 years. While these findings highlight the impact of each cardiovascular condition on the risk of stroke, the data suggest that the elderly are particularly vulnerable to stroke when atrial fibrillation is present. \nRubella susceptibility of an infertile population. The recent trend reported by the CDC reaffirms that rubella continues to be a health care issue and should be a concern particularly for those who care for women in the childbearing age group. Immunization of all susceptible women will not only offer them protection but reduce the pool of susceptible individuals that can transmit the disease. \nAnalysis of the colonoscopic findings in patients with rectal bleeding according to the pattern of their presenting symptoms. Patients presenting with rectal bleeding were prospectively categorized according to the pattern of their presentation into those with outlet bleeding (n = 115), suspicious bleeding (n = 59), hemorrhage (n = 27), and occult bleeding (n = 68). All patients underwent colonoscopy and this was complete in 94 percent. There were 34 patients with carcinoma and 69 with adenomas greater than 1 cm diameter. The percentage of neoplasms proximal to the splenic flexure was 1 percent in outlet bleeding, 24 percent with suspicious bleeding, 75 percent with hemorrhage, and 73 percent with occult bleeding. Barium enema was available in 78 patients and was falsely positive for neoplasms in 21 percent and falsely negative in 45 percent. Colonoscopy is the investigation of choice in patients with suspicious, occult, or severe rectal bleeding. Bleeding of a typical outlet pattern may be investigated by flexible sigmoidoscopy. \nLong-term (2 year) beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic blockade with bucindolol in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Beta-adrenergic blockade represents a promising therapeutic approach to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Bucindolol, a new beta-blocker, showed favorable effects in a short-term (3 month) trial in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. To assess long-term response, 20 study patients (7 of 9 patients previously assigned to the placebo group and 13 of 14 patients previously assigned to bucindolol therapy) received long-term bucindolol therapy and were followed up for a mean of 23 +/- 4 months (range 17 to 30). The mean patient age was 49 years (range 29 to 66) and the median duration of disease was 11 months (range 1 to 190). Ten patients were in functional class II and 10 were in class III; 15 patients were men. At the end of the common follow-up time, all 20 patients were alive, 17 continued to receive bucindolol (mean dose 176 mg/day, range 25 to 200), and 2 underwent cardiac transplantation. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from a baseline value of 25 +/- 8% to 35 +/- 13% (n = 19 pairs, p less than 0.001). Functional class improved in 12, was unchanged in 5 and deteriorated in 3 (p = 0.056). Exercise time was maintained (9.4 +/- 3.1 versus 9.1 +/- 3.5 min, n = 19, p = NS), as was maximal oxygen uptake (19.2 +/- 4.9 versus 18.8 +/- 5.7 ml/kg per min, n = 19, p = NS). Thus, long-term bucindolol therapy leads to substantial increases in ejection fraction and to improved functional class while stable exercise performance is maintained. \nFree-tissue transfer in elderly patients. A retrospective survey was undertaken to evaluate the success of free-tissue transfer (free flap) in the elderly. During a 70-month period, 199 free flaps were performed in 151 patients at the Western Pennsylvania Hospital, 60 of these involving 47 patients over the age of 60. Primary coverage rates differed significantly between the elderly and younger age groups (68.5 versus 85.3 percent, respectively); however, eventual coverage rates (92.6 versus 96.3 percent), minor complication rates (34.0 versus 34.6 percent), mortality rates (2.1 versus 1.0 percent), flap revision rates (32 percent of patients versus 30 percent), and length of postoperative hospitalization (18.7 versus 18.8 days) were not significantly different in the two groups. Among the elderly, significant increases in flap loss rates were noted with the use of end-to-side arterial anastomosis, placement of the anastomosis within a zone of injury, and the use of the gracilis muscle donor site. Our data suggest that the primary cause of free-flap failure is construction of the anastomosis within a zone of injury. Free-tissue transfer is a valuable option in the repair of tissue defects in the elderly and should not be denied as a treatment because of patient age. \nEfficacy and toxicity of thromboxane synthetase inhibitor for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The efficacy and possible side effects of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthetase inhibitor in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were assessed for 24 patients who presented with grades I to IV of the Hunt and Hess classification. All patients underwent aneurysmal clipping within 48 hours after SAH. Postoperatively, TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, Cataclot [sodium (E)-3-[p-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)phenyl]-2-propenoate] was administered to 13 patients by continuous drip infusion at a dose of 1 microgram/kg/min for 8 to 14 days (group A). The remaining 11 patients did not receive this drug (group B). Of the 13 patients in group A, seven patients (54%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm after SAH. Four patients (31%) developed a transient deterioration of consciousness and/or motor disturbance. Three of these patients fully recovered, while one of them showed a mild neurological deficit on discharge. One patient (8%) developed permanent dysphasia and hemiparesis as a result of ischemic brain damage due to vasospasm. One patient (8%) died of the side effect. On the other hand, of the 11 patients in group B, only three (27%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm. One (9%) patient presented a transient neurological deficit but fully recovered upon discharge. Four patients (36%) showed permanent neurological deficits, although they all could lead an independent life after discharge. The three remaining patients developed a severe disturbance of consciousness caused by ischemia due to vasospasm, and two of them died within 1 month after the onset of SAH. In the group treated with Cataclot, two patients developed an epidural hematoma late during the administration of the drug. Of these two, one patient died of increased intracranial pressure that was accelerated by the complication. These results indicate that TXA2 synthetase inhibitor is effective in not only decreasing the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm but also reducing the neurological deterioration due to vasospasm after SAH. However, this drug has a hazardous side effect in that it may promote a tendency to bleed, which caused death in one of our patients. \nThe incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in women undergoing laparoscopy is influenced by the day of menstrual cycle. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a major cause of postoperative morbidity. It can lead to increased recovery time, delaying patient discharge and an increase in hospital costs. Past studies have shown that postoperative nausea and vomiting is more frequent in women than men, appears to elevate around the time of menarche and is reduced around the time of menopause. This retrospective review of a one-year experience of laparoscopic tubal ligation at our institute examined the effect of menstrual cycle on postoperative nausea and vomiting. The anaesthetic and surgical techniques were consistent for all patients. Patient data included age, weight, last day of menstrual cycle, the length of anaesthetic, the dose of inhalational agent, the dose of narcotic, emesis on emergence and whether or not droperidol was used. Of the the 235 patients in the study, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 28%. One hundred fifty-eight had had no preoperative antiemetic and 77 had received droperidol. These two groups were analyzed separately. The incidence in the group not receiving droperidol was 33.5% and in the droperidol group, 16.9% (P less than 0.01). The incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher on the first eight menstrual days (51.6 vs 21.6, P less than 0.001), was highest on day five of the menstrual cycle and lowest on days 18, 19, and 20 where there was no nausea and vomiting. Droperidol reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting but the variation in postoperative nausea and vomiting during the cycle persisted. \nTunneled central venous catheter sepsis: risk factors in a pediatric hospital. All tunnelled central venous catheters (TCVC) placed at the Alberta Children's Hospital in Calgary, Alberta, between November 1984 and July 1987, were retrospectively reviewed to study the association of catheter infection with a number of factors including age, diagnosis, catheter use, and areas caring for children. One hundred children received 130 silastic catheters placed for a total of 17,861 days. Each catheter survived a median of 100 days. Thirty-one episodes of catheter sepsis were identified (one episode for each 576 days of catheter use). Children under 2 years of age had more than two times the risk of catheter infection (p less than 0.01). Children with malabsorption had a greater risk (45.7%) than did those with infection (25.0%) or cancer (15.5%). The use of catheters for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or for multiple purposes markedly increased the risk of catheter infection. The risk of infection of TCVC appears to be great in the young child, in particular, in those requiring TPN or multiple intravenous infusions. Use of TCVC in these children should be avoided if possible. \nSpinal intramedullary ependymal cyst. Report of three cases. Three cases of spinal intramedullary ependymal cyst, two at the thoracolumbar junction and one in the cervical spinal cord, are reported in women in their fifth to seventh decades. Neurological signs and symptoms were extremity dysesthesias, paresthesias, and weakness. Plain cervical and lumbothoracic x-ray films were normal for the patients' age. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a rounded cystic intramedullary mass at the thoracolumbar junction in two cases and at C3-7 in one case. The signal intensity of the cyst contents approximated that of cerebrospinal fluid on T1- and T2-weighted images. Upon administration of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA), MR imaging showed no enhancement in the cyst wall or cavity. Myelotomy and cyst drainage were performed in each case, and the neurological status of each patient improved. The lining of the cyst was biopsied in one of the three patients undergoing surgery and was composed of a single layer of cuboidal cells supported by glial tissue. Periodic acid-Schiff staining of the tissue did not reveal a basement membrane. The findings in these cases suggest that the Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging appearance of intramedullary spinal ependymal cyst is consistent and allows for accurate preoperative diagnosis with or without biopsy. \nIncidence of abnormal RNA studies and dysrhythmias in patients with blunt chest trauma. The incidence and significance of myocardial contusion and subsequent cardiac complications have recently been debated. A prospective study of patients with blunt chest trauma was undertaken at a Regional Trauma Unit between January 1, 1989 and March 31, 1990. One hundred ninety-one patients were entered into the study; 72-hour Holter monitoring was performed in 183 patients, and radionuclide angiography (RNA) was performed on 163 patients. All patients had CPK levels (with CPK-mb fractions) measured, and serial electrocardiographs. There were seven patients with abnormal RNA studies; five of the seven abnormal studies were attributable to previously undiagnosed coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction. Nine patients were diagnosed as having atrial fibrillation, seven of whom were in atrial fibrillation on admission. Ventricular dysrhythmias were classified by the number of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) per hour or the presence of ventricular tachycardia. Twelve patients developed short runs of ventricular tachycardia, and clinically insignificant PVCs were common. Only one patient with ventricular dysrhythmias (frequent PVCs) was treated and there were no hemodynamically significant dysrhythmias. The incidence of clinically significant dysrhythmias or hemodynamically significant myocardial contusion appears to be low in this patient population. Aggressive investigation and monitoring solely for cardiac complications may not be indicated. \nIrreversible drop of systemic vascular resistances in patients implanted with a Jarvik total artificial heart. Maintenance of the body's perfusion by a total artificial heart (TAH) may result in physiological alterations to the circulatory system. Little has been said about modifications to systemic vascular resistances (SVR) during TAH assistance. This paper reports on two patients implanted with a Jarvik - 70 cc TAH, who died after 1 and 3 days, both with an irreversible drop of SVR related to a complete loss of vascular tone but not related to sepsis. Activation of multiple cascades of inflammation, triggered by the extracorporeal circulation (ECC), is maintained during TAH support. Desperately sick patients ",
