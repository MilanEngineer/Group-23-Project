        "text": "tistically significant only in the comparison between the transplant groups. We conclude that HL with normal spirometry have appropriate HCVR, despite pulmonary denervation. Pm0.1 responses of these subjects are increased, however, reflecting either a compensatory response to greater respiratory impedances or an occult alteration of ventilatory mechanics. Moreover, compared with subjects with similar pulmonary function, e.g., heart transplant recipients, the breathing pattern of HL during progressive hypercarbia is consistent with the absence of vagal-mediated inflation inhibition. \nAntral choanal polyp presenting as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children is commonly caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The diagnostic criteria of OSAS in children are not so well delineated as in adults. We report the first case of antral choanal polyp presenting as OSAS in a 10-year-old boy that initially presented to the child psychiatry service for behavior disturbance, enuresis, and daytime somnolence. Overnight electroencephalogram sleep study revealed events consistent with OSAS. Multiple inhalant allergies, chronic maxillary sinusitis, and obstructive adenoid hypertrophy were diagnosed by the allergy and otolaryngology services. The child was scheduled for adenoidectomy when his sleep apnea symptoms persisted following antimicrobial therapy. Examination under anesthesia revealed a normal adenoid bed and a large left antral choanal polyp. Polypectomy was performed as dictated by parental consent. Postoperatively treatment with an intranasal steroid was begun. However, polypoid nasal mucosa recurred in 2 months and a Caldwell-Luc procedure was performed. Subjective reports following surgery indicated improvement in daytime irritability, attention, and mood. A follow-up overnight electroencephalogram sleep study confirmed resolution of OSAS. \nHepatitis C virus infection and chronic liver disease in children with leukemia in long-term remission. Antibody to the recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) was investigated in sera of 50 leukemic children who had chronic liver disease (CLD), observed for 1 to 12.6 years after therapy withdrawal. All patients were tested for anti-HCV at regular intervals: Ortho-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was performed in all cases. Reactive sera were also tested by recombinant immunoblotting assay to define the specificity of the results obtained by ELISA. Twelve cases (24%) were persistently positive (group A), 11 (22%) were transiently anti-HCV+ positive (group B), and 27 (54%) were negative. Mean SGPT peak during follow-up was significantly higher in group A (P = .014, A v B and P less than .00001, A v C). SGPT normalized off-therapy in 1 of 12 cases (group A), 10 of 11 (group B), and 19 of 27 (group C) (P = .0004, A v B and P = .012, A v C). Accordingly, liver histology, available in 37 patients, showed signs of chronic hepatitis in all patients in group A while most patients in group B and C had less severe liver lesions. These results indicate that HCV plays a significant role in the etiology of chronic hepatitis in leukemic patients and that persistent anti-HCV activity correlates with a more severe CLD, which could jeopardize the final prognosis of children cured of leukemia. \nFatty infiltration in the liver in medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Fatty infiltration of the liver at postmortem examination has been recommended as a criterion for selection of infants who have died suddenly and unexpectedly for further biochemical investigation for disorders of fatty acid oxidation. We describe a boy with medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency who died four months after diagnosis and in whom only minimal hepatic fatty infiltration was found. \nNuclear DNA content, tumor cell aggregation, and metastatic events in patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Data on 100 patients who had undergone resection for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach with serosal invasion were examined to assess the prognostic significance of the DNA distribution pattern in relation to the histologic tumor cell aggregation pattern. DNA distribution patterns were classified into low and high ploidies and tumor cell aggregation patterns were classified into free-cell, small nest, and large nest types. The rates of high ploidy in the free-cell, small nest, and large nest types were 23.1%, 48.0%, and 66.7%, respectively, with a significant increase according to the degree of aggregation. The high ploidy group and large nest type had a higher incidence of lymphogenous and hematogenous metastasis than the low ploidy group and free-cell type, respectively. DNA ploidy had no prognostic value for the free-cell type of tumor, but differences in prognosis and the incidence of metastasis between the DNA ploidies were evident in the nest-forming type. Aneuploid tumors consisting of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma were those with nest formation, from the standpoint of histologic structure and metastatic behavior. The DNA analysis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas was of prognostic value, especially in the nest-forming type. \nRadio-immunoassay detection of interferon-gamma in urine after intravesical Evans BCG therapy Our previous studies suggested that interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) was produced in the local immune response to intravesical BCG. To confirm this we modified a commercially available radio-immunoassay for detection of this lymphokine in urine. The urinary levels of IFN gamma were compared in serial urine samples taken from six patients undergoing treatment with Evans strain BCG and seven patients receiving intravesical mitomycin C/epirubicin. IFN gamma was detected consistently in response to BCG with levels reaching a peak (mean 67.1 U/ml., range 7.9 to 155.9 U/ml.) four to six hours post-instillation whereas after other intravesical agents no IFN gamma was detectable after seven of 13 instillations. After the remaining six instillations lower levels were detected (mean 7.4 U/ml., range 0.6 to 22.4 U/ml.). The difference in peak levels between the two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.001 Mann Whitney U test). These results are further evidence of specific cellular immune activity in response to intravesical BCG therapy and suggest anti-tumour mechanisms similar to allograft rejection and autoimmunity. \nAsymptomatic bacterascites: is it spontaneous bacterial peritonitis? Asymptomatic bacterascites is defined as the presence of bacteria in ascitic fluid without clinical features of peritonitis or increased ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cells. Asymptomatic bacterascites is a controversial entity, and little information is available regarding its spontaneous evolution. Clinical features, bacteriological data and outcome in 22 cirrhotic patients with asymptomatic bacterascites are reported and are compared with those of a group of 36 cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Eleven patients had gram-negative bacteria and 11 had one gram-positive bacteria. Only in three patients (13.6%) did peritonitis develop. Twelve patients received no antibiotic therapy, and in none did peritonitis develop. At 1 month, 27% of patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had died. Patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had less-severe liver disease; they more frequently had gram-positive bacteria in ascitic fluid and had a lower 1-mo mortality rate than did patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We conclude that asymptomatic bacterascites is usually the transient residence of bacteria in ascitic fluid. Peritonitis rarely develops in patients with asymptomatic bacterascites and, in most of them, antibiotic therapy is not required. \nA randomized comparison of intravenous heparin with oral aspirin and dipyridamole 24 hours after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator for acute myocardial infarction. National Heart Foundation of Australia Coronary Thrombolysis Group. BACKGROUND. This study addressed the need for heparin administration to be continued for more than 24 hours after coronary thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). METHODS AND RESULTS. A total of 241 patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with 100 mg rt-PA and a bolus of 5,000 units i.v. heparin followed by 1,000 units/hr i.v. heparin for 24 hours. At 24 hours, 202 patients were randomized to continue intravenous heparin therapy (n = 99) in full dosage or to discontinue heparin therapy and begin an oral antiplatelet regimen of aspirin (300 mg/day) and dipyridamole (300 mg/day) (n = 103). On prospective recording, there were no differences in the pattern of chest pain, reinfarction, or bleeding complications. Coronary angiography on cardiac catheterization at 7-10 days showed no differences in patency of the infarct-related artery. The proportion of patients with total occlusion (TIMI grade 0-1) of the infarct-related artery was 18.9% in the heparin group and 19.8% in the aspirin and dipyridamole group. In the patients with an incompletely occluded infarct-related artery, the lumen was reduced by 69 +/- 2% of normal in the heparin group and 67 +/- 2% in the aspirin and dipyridamole group. Left ventricular function assessed on cardiac catheterization and radionuclide study at day 2 and at 1 month showed no differences between the two groups. Left ventricular ejection fraction on radionuclide ventriculography at 1 month was 52.4 +/- 1.2% in the heparin group and 51.9 +/- 1.2% in the aspirin and dipyridamole group. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that heparin therapy can be discontinued 24 hours after rt-PA therapy and replaced with an oral antiplatelet regimen without any adverse effects on chest pain, reinfarction, coronary patency, or left ventricular function. \nPermanent urethral stents for detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. A series of 22 patients, most of whom had spinal injuries with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, have had Medinvent Wallstents placed across the distal mechanism. All but 8 patients had undergone outflow surgery and 11 had had repeated unsuccessful sphincterotomies. The proximal end of the stent was placed over the verumontanum unless fertility was contemplated, when it was placed immediately below the verumontanum. Fifteen patients achieved complete voiding after placement of the first stent; 3 developed bladder neck obstruction after stenting, but in 1 of these cases resolution occurred after bladder neck incision. The 3 patients with artificial urinary sphincters failed to improve after stenting. Use of the urethral stent for patients with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia and failed sphincterotomy is a major advance. It should probably be the primary treatment in selected cases. Its effect on fertility is currently under assessment. \nType I human T cell leukemia virus tax protein transforms rat fibroblasts through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein/activating transcription factor pathway. The Tax oncoprotein of the type I human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) activates transcription of cellular and viral genes through at least two different transcription factor pathways. Tax activates transcription of the c-fos proto-oncogene by a mechanism that appears to involve members of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor (ATF) family of DNA-binding proteins. Tax also induces the nuclear expression of the NF-kappa B family of rel oncogene-related enhancer-binding proteins. We have investigated the potential role of these CREB/ATF and NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors in Tax-mediated transformation by analyzing the oncogenic potential of Tax mutants that functionally segregate these two pathways of transactivation. Rat fibroblasts (Rat2) stably expressing either the wild-type Tax protein or a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to induce NF-kappa B/Rel demonstrated marked changes in morphology and growth characteristics including the ability to form tumors in athymic mice. In contrast, Rat2 cells stably expressing a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to activate transcription through CREB/ATF demonstrated no detectable changes in morphology or growth characteristics. These results suggest that transcriptional activation through the CREB/ATF pathway may play an important role in Tax-mediated cellular transformation. \nDrainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst: an unusual complication. A 34-year-old white woman had external drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst. During sinography, contrast medium filled perigastric varices, causing septic shock. From this experience, we believe that although sinograms are helpful, they should be preceded by prophylactic administration of antibiotics and that contrast material should be sterile. The drainage catheter should be removed as soon as possible. \nPulmonary dysfunction in advanced liver disease: frequent occurrence of an abnormal diffusing capacity. PURPOSE: Abnormalities in pulmonary function have been reported in association with chronic liver disease of varied etiology. The aim of this study was to better define the frequency and nature of these abnormalities in patients who were being evaluated for liver transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a battery of pulmonary function tests and chest radiographs in 116 consecutive patients (50 men, 66 women; aged 19 to 70 years, mean 44.6 years) with severe advanced liver disease who were hospitalized specifically for evaluation for possible orthotopic liver transplantation and were able to perform technically satisfactory tests. In 17 patients, quantitative whole-body technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin perfusion scanning was also performed for assessment of possible right-to-left shunting through intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. RESULTS: The most commonly affected test of lung function was the single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which was abnormal in 48%, 45%, and 71% of patients who never smoked, former smokers, and current smokers, respectively. Ventilatory restriction was noted in 25% of all patients, airflow obstruction (reduced ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity) in only 3%, and a widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in 45%. Diffusion impairment was accompanied by a restrictive defect in only 35% of the patients and by an abnormally widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in 60%. When diffusion impairment was accompanied by an oxygenation defect, it was also associated with a significantly increased right-to-left shunt fraction (mean 24.9%) assessed from quantitative whole-body perfusion imaging. On the other hand, isolated diffusion impairment unaccompanied by significant hypoxemia (noted in approximately a third of the patients with a reduced DLCO) was not associated with evidence of significant intrapulmonary shunting (mean right-to-left shunt fraction 6.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with advanced liver disease have one or more types of abnormality in lung function, a reduced DLCO being the single most common functional defect. Mechanisms accounting for the abnormality in gas transfer may include intrapulmonary vascular dilatations, diffuse interstitial lung disease, pulmonary vaso-occlusive disease, and/or ventilation-perfusion imbalance. \nComparison of a single layer continuous hand-sewn method and circular stapling in 580 oesophageal anastomoses. A total of 611 patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or gastric cardia were operated on between July 1982 and December 1989. Resection was performed in 491 patients (one-stage, 483; two-stage, eight), bypass operation in 97, and 23 had exploration alone. The anastomoses of 580 patients with one-stage resection and bypass operations were evaluated. Hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer of continuous absorbable monofilament suture was performed in 304 patients (221 resections and 83 bypasses). A stapled anastomosis was performed on 276 patients (262 resections and 14 bypasses). Following resection, there were 11 (5 per cent) anastomotic leaks in the hand-sewn group and ten (3.8 per cent) in the stapled anastomosis group (P = 0.69). Excluding anastomotic leaks, hospital mortality and anastomotic recurrence, stricture occurred in 18 of 172 hand-sewn anastomoses (10.5 per cent) and in 57 of 195 stapled anastomoses (29.2 per cent) (P less than 0.001). In patients who had bypass operations there were 12 anastomotic leaks, ten in the hand-sewn group (12.0 per cent) and two in the stapled anastomosis group (14.3 per cent). Only two of the discharged patients with bypass developed anastomotic strictures, a low incidence probably because of short survival. In addition, there were 245 subsidiary anastomoses made in the abdomen by the hand-sewn method as part of the reconstructive procedure, and there was one leak. The results of this non-randomized study suggest that hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer continuous technique for the oesophagus is as safe as the use of circular staplers; hand-sewn anastomosis is less likely to become stenotic. \nDepression and chronic fatigue in cancer patients. Fatigue is a very common symptom among cancer patients. It is crucial to diagnose those patients for whom the fatigue is a symptom of depression, and to treat them appropriately. The key to providing complete and satisfying care is to identify and address the psychologic, social, and medical vulnerabilities of each cancer patient. No one is in a better position to accomplish that than the primary physician. \nAzathioprine induced liver disease: nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver and perivenous fibrosis in a patient treated for multiple sclerosis. Azathioprine hepatotoxicity has been described mainly in renal transplant recipients. Most reported cases are related to lesions of the venous system of the liver: peliosis hepatis, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. The most common clinical manifestation of these hepatic vascular lesions is portal hypertension. We present a case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia and perivenous fibrosis in a patient receiving azathioprine for multiple sclerosis. Histological abnormalities were similar to those described in renal transplant patients, and azathioprine was the only potential hepatotoxic agent present. \nThe immunogenicity and safety of intradermal hepatitis B vaccine. BACKGROUND. One of the chief barriers to a greater use of hepatitis B vaccine is the high cost of the vaccine itself. A number of small research trials have shown that an adequate immune response can be induced at a much lower cost by administering one tenth of the vaccine using an intradermal technique. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether these results could be replicated in a larger clinical trial. METHODS. Vaccine recipients included health care providers, police officers, and firefighters. Recipients were given 0.1 mL of plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine intradermally on days 1, 30, and 180. Antibody response was measured on day 210, with seroconversion defined as a sample-to-negative (S/N) ratio of greater than or equal to 10. Any local and systemic side effects were documented. RESULTS. Six hundred sixteen individuals completed the vaccination series, and seroconversion occurred in 534 (86.7%). The rate of seroconversion in those younger than 40 years was 91.2% and in those 40 years and older was 75.1%. The mean S/N ratio was 154.9 (range 0 to 620) and decreased with increasing age (r = -.25, P = .0001). Side effects were largely limited to local reactions. CONCLUSIONS. The results support the use of the intradermal technique as a cost-effective alternative to the intramuscular route in individuals younger than 40 years. The intradermal technique may be used in older individuals if titers are obtained to assure seroconversion. Because of the restricted availability of the plasma-derived vaccine used in this study, similar trials with recombinant vaccine should be undertaken. \nTemporal changes in the occurrence of hemorrhoids in the United States and England. Although numerous etiologic risk factors have been proposed, the pathogenesis of hemorrhoids remains unknown. The present investigation assesses the temporal distribution of hemorrhoids as depicted by physician visits, hospital discharges, and surgical procedures to provide further insight into potential etiologic risk factors. The analysis was based on five data sources: from the United States, the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI), the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), and the Commission on Professional Hospital Activities (CPHA); from England and Wales, the Morbidity Statistics from General Practice (MSGP) and the Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE). Results demonstrated a consistent decline in all data sources from the United States. The decrease occurred in males and females similarly and was most striking in those aged 45-64 years. Physician visits and hospital discharges for hemorrhoids in England and Wales likewise declined although the decrease was not as dramatic. The consistency of the temporal distributions among the two countries, as well as among the different sources, suggests that the observed decline may, in fact, reflect an overall decrease in the occurrence of hemorrhoidal disease. \nAortoiliac surgery in renal transplant patients. Fifteen patients who had undergone renal transplantation 3 months to 25 years earlier were operated on for treatment of complicated aortoiliac atherosclerosis; eight had aneurysms and seven had stenotic or obstructive lesions. Except for the first patient, operated on in 1973, in whom the kidney was protected by general hypothermia, no special measure was used to protect the kidneys. A transient increase in creatinemia occurred in 11 patients during the postoperative period, whereas creatinine values remained unchanged in the other four. All patients had regained renal function identical to the + preoperative state in less than 10 days; three of them had significant improvement as a result of correction of a lesion that was impairing renal blood flow. Results obtained in this series show that protection of the transplant during aortic surgery is not necessary, provided an adequate surgical technique is used. This technique avoids the complex methods employed in the majority of previously reported cases and appears to be a safe procedure. \nExperimental arterial thrombosis in nonhuman primates. The baboon offers many advantages as an experimental animal to study vascular disease, thrombus formation and dissolution, effects of mediating variables, and the relative efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Each specific application for testing therapeutic agents may require testing in somewhat different model systems. For example, although the arteriovenous vascular graft model is efficient, cost effective, and well adapted to study of interventions for acute arterial thrombosis, surgical endarterectomy extends the evaluation to include interactions with the injured vascular wall. As the antithrombotic products of genetic engineering and molecular biology emerge, it will be increasingly important to have relevant, reproducible, and quantitative approaches to evaluate their effects in vivo. \nCloning and in vitro expression of a melanoma-associated antigen immunogenic in patients with melanoma. The purpose of this study was to identify human melanoma-associated Ag (MAA) that are immunogenic in patients, because these molecules may be useful immunogens to implement active specific immunotherapy. To this end, an expression cDNA library constructed from the human melanoma cell line A375 was screened with sera from patients with melanoma. A 1029-bp cDNA (designated D-1) was isolated. Its nucleotide sequence showed no significant homology with viral and mammalian sequences stored in GE-NETYX. cDNA D-1 hybridized to a 2.0-kb mRNA species from human melanoma, neuroblastoma, erythroleukemia, B lymphoid, and T lymphoid cell lines but not from a renal carcinoma cell line, PBL, and cultured skin fibroblasts. The D-1 clone produced a fusion protein that displayed a significantly higher reactivity with sera from patients with melanoma than from healthy controls. Furthermore, D-1 fusion protein induced in mice antibodies that immunoprecipitated a 50-kDa component from cultured human melanoma cells. The structural properties of D-1 MAA are different from those of previously described MAA. These results suggest that the approach we have applied may be useful to identify novel MAA expressed by melanoma cells. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of recombinant D-1 protein suggests that it may be a valuable immunogen to implement active specific immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, if additional experiments show that it has the appropriate tissue distribution. \nA randomized clinical trial to compare two different approaches in women with chronic pelvic pain. One hundred six patients with chronic pelvic pain were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. In the standard-approach group, organic causes of pelvic pain were excluded first and diagnostic laparoscopy was routinely performed. If no somatic cause could be found, attention was given to other causes such as psychological disturbances. In the second group an integrated approach was chosen. From the beginning equal attention was devoted to somatic, psychological, dietary, environmental, and physiotherapeutic factors. In this group, laparoscopy was not routinely performed. Both groups were similar with respect to clinical characteristics of the patients and the severity of their pain as assessed by various pain parameters. Postcoital pain was reported by 27% of the patients. Twenty percent of the patients had had negative sexual experiences such as childhood sexual abuse or rape. Evaluation of the pain 1 year after the institution of treatment revealed that the integrated approach improved pelvic pain significantly more often than the standard approach for three out of four pain parameters (P less than .01). Laparoscopy played no important role in the treatment of pelvic pain. It is concluded that equal attention to both organic and other causative factors from the beginning of therapy is more likely to result in a reduction of pelvic pain than is a standard approach. \nMultivessel coronary artery disease: a key predictor of short-term prognosis after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) Study Group. Results of recent studies have suggested that routine cardiac catheterization may be unnecessary after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Therefore to better define the short-term prognostic value of early coronary angiography, and specifically the prognostic significance of multivessel coronary artery disease, the angiographic findings of 855 patients consecutively enrolled in five phases of the TAMI study were correlated with their in-hospital outcome. All patients received intravenous thrombolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, or both agents) and underwent cardiac catheterization within 90 minutes of the initiation of therapy. Multivessel disease, defined as the presence of greater than or equal to 75% luminal diameter stenosis in two or more major epicardial arteries, was documented in 236 patients. When compared with the group of patients without multivessel disease, this group had a higher prevalence of coronary risk factors and more frequently had a history of antecedent ischemic chest pain. Although the severity of the infarct zone dysfunction was similar in the two groups (-2.77 +/- 1.00 vs -2.50 +/- 1.09 SD/chord, p = NS), global left ventricular ejection fraction was lower in the group with multivessel disease (48.6 +/- 12.4% vs 51.8 +/- 10.6%, p less than 0.01). This was associated with a significant difference in the function of the noninfarct zone. Whereas this region was hyperkinetic in the group with minimal or single-vessel disease, it was hypocontractile or dyskinetic in those with multivessel disease (+0.66 +/- 1.53 vs -0.52 +/- 1.73 SD/chord, p = 0.0001). \nImpact of magnetic resonance imaging on the management of diabetic foot infections. This combined retrospective/prospective study evaluated the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 18 diabetic patients with apparent foot infections. The goal was to define the impact of MRI on directing the expedient and accurate surgical intervention so important in achieving optimal preservation of limb tissue and function. We found that MRI provides a rapid and reliable means of \"viewing\" the diabetic foot. Unsuspected or poorly localized abscess cavities can be pinpointed for thorough drainage with minimal exploration. An abscess can be differentiated from cellulitis or osteomyelitis. Moreover, persistent fever following drainage of a foot abscess can be reliably evaluated via MRI, obviating the need for empiric surgical reexploration. This exciting noninvasive imaging technique leads to the most accurate surgical drainage of foot abscesses and, at the same time, can prevent unnecessary surgical exploration of the tenuous diabetic foot. \nRegulation of gene expression in renal compensatory growth. Compensatory renal hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in cell protein content. There are a number of different cellular mechanisms by which such an increase could be mediated. The relative contributions of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression to the increase in constitutively expressed cellular proteins were examined in mouse kidneys undergoing compensatory growth following unilateral nephrectomy (UNI-NX). Over the 14-day study period, total protein per kidney increased by up to 37%. Northern blot analysis of the expression of the mRNAs for a number of genes associated with cell growth indicated that there was no significant increase in steady-state levels of these selected genes in nephrectomized compared with sham-operated animals. In vitro assays to measure transcriptional regulation of the same set of genes in compensatory growth showed no increase in the rate of transcription. However, transcription of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene was increased 24 hours after nephrectomy. Immunoblots of two representative proteins showed that the concentration of these proteins in total kidney protein remained constant in the different experimental groups. Since total protein increased, the concentration of these proteins in the hypertrophied kidney must have increased. Taken together, these data suggest that posttranscriptional mechanisms may account for the increase in at least some constitutively expressed proteins in cells undergoing compensatory growth. \nConcurrent hydralazine administration prevents nitroglycerin-induced hemodynamic tolerance in experimental heart failure. BACKGROUND. Organic nitrates such as nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate are useful in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), but tolerance develops rapidly during continuous administration. Because combination therapy of nitrate and hydralazine has been shown to provide both short- and long-term benefit but nitrate alone produces hemodynamic tolerance, we questioned whether hydralazine can preserve the favorable preload effects of nitroglycerin. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using an in vivo model of nitroglycerin tolerance in the CHF rat, we examined the effects of hydralazine bolus dosing during continuous nitroglycerin infusion. Continuous infusion of nitroglycerin alone (10 micrograms/min) produced initial reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 40-50%, which returned to baseline by 8 hours (tolerance development). Coadministration of hydralazine (2 x 0.1 mg) maintained the effects of nitroglycerin infusion on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (45% reduction at 10 hours). This hydralazine dose alone reduced left ventricular peak systolic pressure by approximately 12 +/- 3% but had no effect on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Hydralazine dosing did not affect steady-state plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin or metabolites, and hydralazine was unable to prevent nitroglycerin tolerance induced in vitro. CONCLUSIONS. The beneficial interaction of hydralazine on the preload effects of nitroglycerin may explain the long-term clinical efficacy of hydralazine/nitrate combination in CHF. Our results also suggest that the mechanism of in vivo nitrate tolerance in CHF may be systemic rather than vascular in origin. \nClonidine inhibits vesico-sphincter reflexes in patients with chronic spinal lesions. When administered systemically to spinalized animals, clonidine, the prototypic alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist, purportedly acts at spinal sites to suppress motor responses related to painful peripheral and vesical stimulation and spasticity, and to improve vesicourethral coordination. Hence, the action of clonidine (400 micrograms in three divided doses in a 16-hour span) on spinal vesical and somatic reflexes was examined in five patients with suprasacral spinal cord lesions by assessing volume-induced micturition reflexes and limb motor discharges that occurred spontaneously or were elicited by noxious and nonnoxious cutaneous stimulation. Clonidine caused a significant reduction in (1) blood pressure, (2) amplitude of detrusor contraction, and (3) vesical external urethral sphincter dyssynergia. Limb motor electromyography discharges were not markedly attenuated, although spatiotemporal changes (eg, irradiation, after-discharges) were observed in some of the patients. The results are ascribed to binding to spinal cord alpha 2 adrenergic receptors located on segmental and intersegmental (propriospinal) interneurons, released from descending inhibition, with greater motor system specificity on striated sphincter innervation. Clonidine may be clinically effective in the treatment of hyperactive micturition reflexes in patients with chronic spinal lesions. \nThe effect of caffeine on postprandial hypotension in the elderly In a double-blind, randomized trial the effects of caffeinated and decaffeinated drinks on postprandial hemodynamic and neurohumoral changes were studied in seven fit, elderly subjects after a standard 2.4MJ meal. There was a significant difference in supine postprandial systolic blood pressure between the placebo and caffeine phases (P less than 0.01); at 60 minutes, supine systolic blood pressure had fallen 14 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI)-7 to-21 mmHg, p less than 0.01) after placebo, but was unchanged after caffeine (+9 mmHg, CI 0 to 18 mmHg, NS]. Similar differences between placebo and caffeine were seen in erect systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01), although orthostatic tolerance was maintained throughout each study period. Postprandial plasma noradrenaline levels were higher (P less than 0.02) and the increase greater (P less than 0.02) after caffeine than after placebo. Caffeine administered at the end of a standard test meal prevents the postprandial fall in blood pressure in fit, elderly subjects. The clinical relevance of this finding has yet to be determined, but it may offer a simple remedy for patients with symptomatic postprandial hypotension. \nAdvances in the understanding and treatment of urinary tract infections in young women. Despite relative ease of management, the high rate of urinary tract infections (UTI) among young women presents substantial problems for the health care community. Although the majority of UTIs in young women are simple and uncomplicated, the rate of recurrence is substantial. Each treatment of UTI recurrence brings greater antibiotic resistance, requiring the use of broader spectrum and more expensive antibiotic therapy. Moreover, infection in patients with underlying urinary tract or systemic diseases can lead to serious medical and financial consequences. A better understanding of antibiotic resistance, particularly in regard to beta-lactamase-producing pathogens, has allowed us to develop more appropriate criteria for selecting antibiotics as well as the duration of therapy. The overall cost for treating UTIs in young women is a substantial health care expenditure, and requires an ongoing examination of new information concerning pathogenesis and available antibiotic therapies. \nStaged repair of interrupted aortic arch and ventricular septal defect in infancy. Staged repair of interrupted aortic arch and ventricular septal defect was carried out in 20 infants from 1979 through 1990. Among the important associated cardiac defects were transposition of the great arteries, truncus arteriosus, and anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery. The first stage, usually consisting of the placement of an 8- or 10-mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft, pulmonary artery banding, and ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus, resulted in 20 survivors (100%) There were two interim deaths (10%) before the second stage of ventricular septal defect closure and pulmonary artery band removal, which had 15 survivors (83%, 15/18). Because the major morbidity and mortality early in this experience could be traced to leaving the pulmonary artery band on too long, early removal (within 2 to 3 months) was begun. Since 1985, 8 (100%) of 8 infants have survived both stages and are now doing well. Because of the relatively large polytetrafluoroethylene graft, only 1 child (aged 9 years) has experienced substantial late aortic arch obstruction and undergone placement of an 18-mm Dacron graft without difficulty. Of interest is the finding that in only 1 (5%) of the 20 patients has major (greater than or equal to 40-mm Hg gradient) left ventricular outflow tract obstruction developed. In summary, the staged repair of interrupted aortic arch with ventricular septal defect has become very reliable despite the condition of the infant or major associated cardiac anomalies and can be recommended for infants at high risk for primary repair. More long-term information will be needed to determine which approach will be the best choice for the majority of infants. \nColorectal cancer patients with high risk of hematogenous metastasis: correlation with CEA levels in peripheral and draining venous blood during the period of operation. Correlations between carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels of peripheral (p) and draining (d) venous blood during the period of operation, and pre- and post-operatively detected hematogenous metastases were examined in 78 patients with colorectal cancer. The metastases were found in 28 patients (HM group), but not found in the other 50 patients (non-HM group). The mean values (43 and 198 ng/ml) and positive rates (61 and 96%) greater than 5 ng/ml of p- and d-CEA levels in the HM group were significantly higher than those (6 and 14 ng/ml, and 22 and 48%, respectively) in the non-HM group. The differences (mean 184 ng/ml and positive rate 49%) of d-CEA levels between both groups were more significant than those (39 ng/ml and 30%) of p-CEA levels. The mean value (155 ng/ml) and positive rate (82%) greater than 5 ng/ml of the gradient between d- and p-CEA levels (d-p CEA gradient) in the HM group were significantly higher than those (8 ng/ml and 34%) in the non-HM group. These results suggest that patients with a high risk of hematogenous metastases are more effectively checked by the determination of d-CEA levels and d-p CEA gradient than of p-CEA levels, and that they are patients with positive d-CEA and d-p CEA gradient levels. \nContemporary management of neurofibromatosis. The neurofibromatoses are two distinct entities with different genetic origins. The phenotypic expressions and required treatments are different. The devastating nature of neurofibromatosis-2 may be more effectively controlled through the application of advanced imaging techniques and contemporary neurotologic procedures. The most common manifestation of neurofibromatosis-2 is that of bilateral acoustic neuromas. The eventual total bilateral sensorineural deafness associated with this condition can be obviated in selected cases if the diagnosis is established early. Follow-up data are reported for three patients in whom hearing was preserved in at least one ear. When removal with hearing preservation is not possible, subtotal tumor removal with decompression of the internal auditory canals may delay progression of hearing loss. A new approach to tumors of the pterygomaxillary fossa that have extended to the middle cranial fossa has been successfully applied and is described. \nThe effects of chronic endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy on portal pressure in cirrhotics. The effect of obliterating esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy on portal pressure was prospectively studied in 11 cirrhotic patients with variceal hemorrhage. Portal venous pressure gradient, determined as the difference between transhepatic portal and hepatic vein pressure, increased by a mean of 31.1% +/- 14.5% in 8 (73%) and decreased by a mean of 30.1% +/- 11.7% in 3 (27%) patients, with no statistically significant change overall (P = 0.1). These changes in portal venous pressure gradient occurred despite an improvement in the laboratory and clinical parameters of hepatic function. Deep abdominal sonography with color flow imaging at variceal obliteration showed patent paraumbilical veins in 6 (55%) patients, 3 of whom had decreases in portal venous pressure gradient (29%, 19%, 42.5%) at variceal obliteration. In 5 (45%) patients without patent paraumbilical veins, a statistically significant increase in portal venous pressure gradient between initial endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy and variceal obliteration was noted (P = 0.008). Rebleeding (single episode in all 4 patients, before obliteration in 3 patients) occurred in those with an increase in portal venous pressure gradient; all patients with portal venous pressure gradient decreases were nonbleeders. No correlation between changes in portal venous pressure gradient and time to variceal obliteration, number of sclerotherapy treatments, or rebleeding episodes was observed. Thus, an increase in portal venous pressure gradient was noted in the majority of patients at variceal obliteration. Although the portal venous pressure gradient decrease may be explained by a patent paraumbilical vein, the mechanism of portal venous pressure gradient increase is not clear. It is speculated that this portal venous pressure gradient increase may be caused by an increase in collateral resistance or flow or a combination of both, resulting from obliteration of esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy. \nRole of emergency medical services. For thrombolytic therapy to be effective in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, the patient must enter the health care center delivery system in an efficient manner. Some entry delays are due to patient decisions and interactions with others. In the United States, prehospital care is delivered by a variety of different systems, varying from public service types such as fire-department based to private types of service. These personnel vary in level of training from paramedics with a high level of training to Emergency Medical Technicians-Ambulance with basic training (first aid), even less in some areas. The training should be upgraded so that training as an emergency medical technician with the ability to defibrillate would be the minimum level for emergency ambulance personnel; wherever economically and logistically feasible, ambulance personnel should be paramedics. Although the 911 emergency telephone system exists in some areas, there is no centralized, universal system for access, causing confusion and delays in obtaining care in critical situations such as cardiac arrest. There is a need for a national emergency number--911--with the ability to identify the calling number and address. Since dispatchers have little medical dispatch training, needed instructions are not given to the caller, which can reduce the patient's chance of survival. Trained dispatchers are needed to dispatch resources efficiently and to offer assistance until trained rescuers arrive. Ambulances are inefficiently located in some areas of the United States, slowing response to the patient. \nEffort thrombosis of the axillosubclavian vein: a disabling vascular disorder. In the natural history of this disorder, resumption of normal activity after a period of recuperation (following an episode of thrombosis) frequently leads to symptoms of upper extremity venous hypertension exacerbated by using the arms in the overhead position. This position can be demonstrated venographically to further occlude collateral vessels in thoracic outlet. A number of patients develop more extensive symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. Anticoagulation may protect the collateral vessels and interrupt the period of active clot propagation resulting in a better functional result than would be expected from the natural history of the thrombotic event. In our experience, local Urokinase was the most effective means for reestablishing venous patency. With clot dissolution the underlying compression of the vein at the thoracic outlet can be demonstrated. Balloon angioplasty should not be undertaken in the acute setting nor prior to relieving the tendinous compression. The acute phlebitic process should resolve under the protection of Coumadin for three months. At that time it can be determined more effectively which patients require additional therapy. Removal of the first rib will decompress the axillosubclavian vein and the thoracic outlet collaterals permitting the vein to regain its normal configuration particularly in younger patients with more acute onset of compression. In those patients with more chronic compression the vein becomes stenotic. Improvement of the luminal configuration has been accomplished with transvenous balloon angioplasty without the necessity for venous reconstructive procedures in this series. Patients with Paget-Schroetter syndrome have a symptom complex which often reflects more extensive neurovascular compression at the thoracic outlet than that which might result from venous hypertension alone. Although thrombolytic therapy can restore patency of the axillosubclavian vein, first rib resection is necessary to relieve the external compression. This procedure was very effective in patients who had restoration of subclavian vein patency, and to a lesser degree in those with residual occlusion. \nPaul Broca and the first craniotomy based on cerebral localization. Paul Broca (1824-1880) was a well-known French surgeon-anthropologist-neurologist. Best known for his work on cerebral cortical localization and speech mechanisms, Broca also carefully worked out skull and scalp localization for underlying cortical regions. In 1871, Broca treated a man who had sustained a scalp laceration from a blow to the head without loss of consciousness or skull fracture. The patient exhibited a nonfluent aphasia about 1 month after injury and became progressively obtunded and eventually comatose. Suspecting an intracranial abscess, Broca trephined at the region of the left third frontal convolution and drained an epidural abscess. The patient improved transiently but died a few days later. Autopsy showed a left-sided, predominantly frontal purulent meningoencephalitis. Broca's other neurosurgical contributions included various surgical cases, methods for scalp localization of the cerebral convolutions, extensive studies of skull and brain abnormalities, thermoencephalography, and the stimulation of younger surgical colleagues and neurologists to make practical use of cerebral localization. \nHLA class I antigen expression as a measure of response to antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B. HLA class I antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells was evaluated by flow cytometry in 21 HBeAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B. Measurements were made before, during or after treatment with recombinant interferon-alpha-2b, either given alone or after a 6 wk course of prednisone. Immunohistochemical staining for human leukocyte class I antigen was also evaluated in 28 percutaneous liver biopsy specimens either obtained before or after therapy (N = 27) and during therapy in one instance. The amount of HLA class I antigen on peripheral blood mononuclear cells varied markedly among individual patients, but the overall results indicated that the level of inducible antigen did not correlate with increments of ALT during therapy or with a virological response to therapy. Hepatocyte staining for HLA class I antigen was observed in a minority of biopsy specimens (29%) and also did not appear to predict a response or correlate with the severity of histological disease. These data do not support current theories concerning pathogenetic mechanisms in chronic hepatitis B nor do they suggest that spontaneous display of HLA class I antigen on hepatocytes or interferon-induced expression of these antigens on peripheral blood mononuclear cells is a critical determinant for a response to therapy. \nDispersion of ventricular repolarization in the long QT syndrome. To identify markers of dispersion of the ventricular repolarization in the idiopathic long QT syndrome, body surface potential maps were analyzed in 40 such patients (mean age +/- standard deviation 21 +/- 11 years) and in 30 healthy control subjects (mean age 24 +/- 7 years). In each subject, 117 chest leads were recorded and maps of the integral values of the QRST interval were calculated. A multipolar distribution of the values, a marker of gross electrical inequalities of repolarization, was found only in 4 patients. To detect minor regional disparities of ventricular recovery, all the ST-T waveforms were analyzed in each subject. The ST-T waves were represented by a discrete series of potential values. The \"similarity index\" was computed by applying a principal component analysis, which represents (in percent) to what extent 1 fundamental pattern of ST-T reproduces all the recorded waveforms. The mean value of the similarity index was significantly lower in patients with long QT syndrome than in control subjects (49 +/- 10 vs 77 +/- 8%, p less than 0.0001). A value less than 61% (corresponding to 2 standard deviations below the mean value for controls) was found in 35 of 40 patients and in only 1 control subject (sensitivity 87%, specificity 96%). Thus, the similarity index is a more sensitive marker than the multipolar distribution of QRST integral maps in revealing electrical disparities of the ventricular recovery times. \nSpatial misregistration of vascular flow during MR imaging of the CNS: cause and clinical significance. Spatial misregistration of signal recovered from flowing spins within vascular structures is a common phenomenon seen in MR imaging of the CNS. The condition is displayed as a bright line or dot offset from the true anatomic location of the lumen of the imaged vessel. Its origin is the time delay between application of the phase- and frequency-encoding gradients used to locate spins within the plane of section. The principal condition necessary for the production of spatial misregistration is flow oblique to the axis of the phase-encoding gradient. Flow-related enhancement (entry slice phenomenon), even-echo rephasing, and gradient-moment nulling contribute to the production of the bright signal of spatial misregistration. Familiarity with the typical appearance of flow-dependent spatial misregistration permits confirmation of a vessel's patency; identification of the direction of flow; estimation of the velocity of flow; and differentiation of this flow artifact from atheromas, dissection, intraluminal clot, and artifacts such as chemical shift. \nTrends in the operative management of invasive squamous carcinoma of the vulva at Indiana University, 1974 to 1988. From January 1974 to March 1988, 150 patients with primary invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva underwent surgery at Indiana University. There has been a trend toward more conservative surgical management of this disease. To determine the impact of this trend on clinical outcome, cases were divided into three groups according to date of operation: group I, 1974 to 1978; group II, 1979 to 1983; and group III, 1984 to 1988. Overall, 80 patients had en bloc radical vulvectomy and groin dissection, 20 had modified radical vulvectomy and bilateral groin dissection through three separate incisions, and 36 had modified radical vulvectomy and unilateral superficial groin dissection. Fourteen patients had other operations. Forty-two patients (27.3%) had radiotherapy in addition to surgery. Among the three groups, there were no differences when mean age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage distribution (1988 system), mean lesion size, mean depth of invasion, or grade distribution were compared. A significant trend toward more conservative surgical therapy was observed. En bloc radical vulvectomy was performed in 77.4% of group I patients, 71.1% of group II patients, and 35.8% of group III patients (p less than 0.001). Mean days of hospitalization were also reduced significantly. Group I had a mean stay of 30 days, group II had a mean stay of 23 days, and group III had a mean stay of 11 days (p less than 0.001). Mean operative blood loss (group I, 754.8 ml; group II, 620.0 ml; group III, 393.6 ml; p = 0.03), mean units of blood transfused (group I, 1.4 units; group II, 1.3 units; group III, 0.4 units; p less than 0.01), and mean hours of operating time (group I, 3.7 hours; group II, 3.7 hours; group III, 3.2 hours; p = 0.02) were also reduced. \nDetubularisation in cystoplasty: clinical review. Cystoplasty using a detubularised bowel segment is preferable to using a tubularised length of intestine. This has been shown experimentally to result in a reduction in the contractility of the neobladder, although contractions are not completely abolished. Incontinence, especially nocturnal, may still be a problem. Assessment of renal function has shown a marked incidence of upper tract dysfunction despite detubularisation. All patients remain at risk of upper tract obstruction following cystoplasty. Because bowel contraction waves are brought on by distension, it may be possible either to postpone or to prevent the onset of contractions by avoiding an excessive build-up of bladder volume. Clean intermittent self-catheterisation is an efficient means of emptying the bladder, although sphincter rebalancing may also be required. \nAltered gallbladder contractility after extracorporeal shock-wave cholecystolithotripsy. Change in gallbladder contractility after biliary extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) may significantly influence the clearance of fragments after successful gallstone fragmentation. We assessed changes in gallbladder contractility in response to an oral fatty meal in 50 patients 1 month after biliary ESWL (all fragments were smaller than 3 mm) and also in a separate group of 10 patients 3 months after complete clearance of fragments. The prevalence of persistent lumen-obliterating contraction of the gallbladder after biliary ESWL also was analyzed in 325 patients. Gallbladder contractility remained unchanged in 30, increased in nine, and decreased in 11 of the 50 patients. The average reduction in the fasting gallbladder volume after lithotripsy was 28% (p less than .001). Gallbladder contractility remained unchanged 3 months after complete clearance of fragments in six of 10 patients studied separately. A decrease (n = 2) or increase (n = 2) in contractility was seen in the remaining patients. No significant difference occurred in the average ejection fraction of the gallbladder before lithotripsy and after complete clearance of the fragments. Thirty-four of the 325 patients who have so far undergone biliary ESWL had a completely contracted gallbladder with no lumen visible on sonography. The gallbladder returned to a relaxed state in half of these patients within 1-9 months. Thus, biliary ESWL did not significantly alter gallbladder contractility in 60% of patients. A significant reduction in the volume of the fasting gallbladder occurred after lithotripsy. Successful clearance of fragments did not improve the contractility of stonebearing gallbladders in the majority of patients. \nThe modified transcochlear approach to the cerebellopontine angle. We have modified the transcochlear approach to improve exposure of the anterior petrous apex, clivus, anterior cerebellopontine angle, and the prepontine region. These changes include resection of the external auditory canal, middle ear, glenoid fossa, and posterior zygomatic arch. This approach provides improved exposure of the petrous carotid artery, jugular bulb, and clivus. It offers the largest and most lateral access to the anterior cerebellopontine and prepontine region. The results of this approach in 11 patients are discussed. \nComparison of catheter ablation using radiofrequency versus direct current energy: biophysical, electrophysiologic and pathologic observations. The effects of catheter ablation with radiofrequency versus direct current energy were compared in 18 dogs assigned to two groups (of 9 dogs each). Each dog underwent a single ablation at two sites in the left ventricle at energy levels of 100, 200 or 300 J delivered in unipolar configuration to six dogs each. A transient decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure (from 121.3 +/- 24.5 to 94.2 +/- 18.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and wall motion abnormality were noted in dogs with direct current shock. The left ventricular ejection fraction decreased (from 50 +/- 2% to 34 +/- 3%, p less than 0.001) shortly after direct current ablation but improved 4 weeks later to 43 +/- 3%. There were no significant changes in left ventricular pressure, wall motion or ejection fraction in dogs in the radiofrequency ablation group. Sustained ventricular tachycardia (greater than or equal to 30 s) was seen immediately after direct current shock in all dogs, and one dog died of intractable ventricular fibrillation. A 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor obtained immediately after the procedure showed multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia in all dogs exposed to direct current ablation but in only three dogs that underwent radiofrequency ablation. No differences were found in peak creatine kinase, complete blood count with smear and B-beta 15-42 fibrinopeptide levels. Pathologically, direct current-induced lesions were larger (mean length x width x depth 10.9 x 7.5 x 5.2 vs. 4.8 x 4.6 x 4.3 mm) and were poorly circumscribed with inhomogeneous margins of necrosis. \nThe influence of intraoperative hypotension and perioperative blood transfusion on disease-free survival in patients with complete resection of colorectal liver metastases. An increased interest in surgical treatment of liver metastases from colorectal origin has evolved recently. However not all patients benefit from this approach, with early recurrence and death still being encountered. To evaluate clinical as well as perioperative factors that might significantly affect the outcome of patients with completely resected colorectal liver metastases, we examined 116 patients who underwent resection between September 1987 and August 1989. Median follow-up time was 13.2 months (0.6 to 31.4 months). The overall survival rate was 91% at 1 year and 75% at 2 years. Median survival was not reached. Median disease-free survival time was 11.5 months, with 49.4% and 21.2% of the patients being free of disease at 1 and 2 years, respectively. By univariate analysis, site of primary colorectal cancer, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, size of metastases, number of metastases, length of operation time, percentage mean arterial pressure, number of hypotensive episodes, duration of hypotensive episodes, and whole blood transfusion significantly affected recurrence rate following resection. However only site of primary tumor, CEA, number of metastases, and number of hypotensive episodes remained significant in the multivariate analysis. The most significant single factor that affected recurrence rate was the number of hypotensive episodes during the operative procedure. It is concluded that hypotensive episodes, even when well controlled, should be avoided during operation to maximize the chances of cure and prolong disease-free survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases. \nFailure of physicians to recognize acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in chronic alcoholics. We encountered six alcoholic patients with severe acetaminophen hepatotoxicity during a 2-year period. All patients had marked elevations of aminotransferases and sometimes remarkably high prothrombin times at, or shortly after, presentation. In five of six cases the diagnosis was missed by the physicians initially caring for the patient. The apparent reasons for the missed diagnosis were insufficient history regarding the use of acetaminophen, an inappropriate reliance on blood acetaminophen levels, and lack of knowledge regarding typical aminotransferase elevations in alcoholic hepatitis vs acetaminophen toxicity. The initial clinical presentation of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in chronic alcoholics is easily recognized clinically and is distinct from acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in suicide ingestions and from alcoholic hepatitis. Internists and other physicians should be aware of this entity and rely on the clinical picture and the history of acetaminophen use to confirm the diagnosis. \nAn alternative explanation for the genesis of closed-lock symptoms in the internal derangement process. Clinical and surgical data on 194 operated joints (135 patients) were used to substantiate a new concept challenging the presumed natural history of temporomandibular internal derangement (ID). A number of findings were incompatible with the traditional depiction of a progressive process based on gradual changes in disc position and shape. These findings were a lack or correlation between increasing age and the stages of the process; the percentage of patients in the third stage (closed lock) with limited opening (less than 25 mm) too severe to be caused solely by a nonreducible, displaced disc; the unexpectedly high incidence (greater than 50%) of normally shaped discs in the third stage of the process. A specific condition of severe and stubborn limited maximal mouth opening caused by total cessation of gliding, liable to occur at any age and unrelated to disc shape or position, which responds successfully to simple treatment by lavage and lysis, pressured injection, or arthrocentesis, was discerned. Lack of gliding was attributed to adherence of the disc to the fossa by a reversible effect such as a vacuum and/or decreased volume of synovial fluid of high viscosity. This condition was deemed worthy of an independent identity, dissociated from disc displacement, as a causative factor in the second and third stages of ID, and particularly as an aid to accurate diagnosis and treatment. \nIntracanalicular acoustic neurinomas. The cases of 16 patients with acoustic neurinomas confined to the intracanalicular area are presented. These represent 2.7% of the 600 patients with acoustic neurinomas consecutively operated upon at the Neurosurgical Clinic at Nordstadt Hospital during the last 8 years. The comparatively earlier onset of vestibular symptoms and signs was characteristic of this group and precipitated diagnosis. The diagnostic reliability of magnetic resonance imaging was at least equivalent to that of air computed tomographic cisternography. Complete tumor removal was accomplished via the suboccipital approach in all patients, with 100% preservation of facial nerve and facial function; the cochlear nerve was preserved anatomically in 100% of the patients and functionally in 57%. No recurrence has occurred during follow-up periods of up to 8 years in all 16 patients. A broad spectrum of the current literature is considered, and purely intracanalicular acoustic neurinomas are discussed with regard to clinical characteristics, diagnostic steps-including neuroradiological and neurophysiological approaches-and surgical treatment and results. \nAcute gall bladder perforation--a dilemma in early diagnosis. Gall bladder perforation is a rare complication of cholecystitis. A definitive diagnosis is uncommon before surgery and the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition are high. We report six patients with gall bladder perforation to show the difficulty of making an early diagnosis. The history and the clinical findings of these patients are reviewed to highlight diagnostic pitfalls. \nGenital human papillomavirus infection in men. Diagnosis and treatment with a laser and 5-fluorouracil. One hundred twenty-eight consecutive men, sexual partners (for more than six months) of women treated for genital condylomata acuminata, were evaluated with colposcopy to assess the percentage of infected men among the couples. Ninety-three (73%) of the men were found to have a genital human papillomavirus infection on colposcopically directed biopsies. All but one patient were treated with outpatient colposcopically guided laser vaporization under local anesthesia (one patient with extensive condylomata required general anesthesia). Two weeks after laser surgery, 5% 5-fluorouracil cream, used in the genital area, was initiated on a weekly basis for two months and every other week for two more months. Patients were followed in the clinic with colposcopy performed every eight weeks for six months to evaluate the regimen's results. Thirty-seven (40%) of the 93 men had \"clinically\" apparent genital HPV infection, and 56 (60%) of the 93 had \"subclinical\" disease (as determined with colposcopy). The majority of the patients (87 of 93, or 94%) responded to one laser treatment followed by 5-fluorouracil cream and had no visible lesions at six months. Colposcopic evaluation of the male partners of infected women and laser surgery followed by topical 5-fluorouracil therapy appear to be safe and effective in controlling genital HPV infection. \n3DFT MR angiography of the carotid bifurcation: potential and limitations as a screening examination. The authors compared the three-dimensional Fourier transform (3DFT) time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiograms in 38 patients initially studied with selective intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for suspected arteriosclerotic disease of the carotid bifurcation. MR angiograms were successfully obtained in 65 of the 75 carotid arteries (87%) visualized with DSA. DSA and MR angiographic studies were assessed for percentage area stenosis by two independent observers on two occasions. Statistical tests indicated consistency in interpretation for each observer as well as between observers. No significant difference was found between the two modalities in ability to depict changes in percentage area stenosis. For the 32 right carotid arteries in the comparison, the median for the difference between MR angiography and intraarterial DSA was 1.83% (range, -22.38% to 55.60%); for the 33 visualized left carotid arteries, it was 0.00% (range, -20.55% to 49.95%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that technically adequate MR angiography may be a sensitive screening examination for stenoses. \nPericardial haemorrhage causing right atrial compression after cardiac surgery: role of transoesophageal echocardiography. After cardiac surgery transoesophageal echocardiography showed a large thrombus compressing the right atrium in three hypotensive patients. No satisfactory images were obtained by transthoracic imaging, which is often difficult in ventilated patients after cardiac surgery. Transoesophageal echocardiography, however, provided rapid diagnostic information and permitted prompt surgical intervention. \nPlasmapheresis in a case of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome with ascending polyneuropathy. Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome complicated by ascending polyneuropathy in a 40-year-old woman is described. High-dose intravenous steroids had no beneficial effect on the clinical course. Dramatic and rapid clinical improvement occurred with the use of plasmapheresis. The use of this therapeutic modality should be considered in patients with a similar clinical presentation. \nThe interpretation of dysprosody in patients with Parkinson's disease. Prosodic features in the speech production of 21 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were tested. The appreciation of vocal and facial expression was also examined in the same patients. Significant intergroup differences were found in the prosody production tasks but, in contrast to previous results, not in the receptive tasks on the recognition and appreciation of prosody and of facial expression. The discrepancy between the production and recognition of prosodic features does not support the suggestion that dysprosody in Parkinson's disease is necessarily a disorder of processing emotional information that could be misinterpreted as a dysarthria. \nPhase I/II trial of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Forty-seven patients with hematologic neoplasia received recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) by daily 2-hour infusion following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors in a phase I-II dose-escalation trial. Dose levels ranged from 30 to 500 micrograms/m2/d. At doses at or below 250 micrograms/m2/d, toxicity felt to be caused by rhGM-CSF was negligible. However, three of five patients treated with 500 micrograms/m2/d had unacceptable side effects caused by rhGM-CSF. Two different graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylactic regimens were administered. Twenty-seven evaluable patients were administered regimens that did not contain methotrexate (MTX) (Group I) and reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL by a median of day 14. In contrast, 18 patients who received GVHD prophylactic regimens containing MTX (Group II) reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL on a median of day 20. Patients in Group I had fewer febrile days and, of those discharged, had shorter initial hospitalizations than patients in Group II. The overall incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade 2 or greater) in the rhGM-CSF-treated patients was 28% and was similar to that in historical \"good risk\" patients who did not receive rhGM-CSF. These preliminary data suggest rhGM-CSF is unlikely to exacerbate GVHD in HLA-identical sibling donor transplants and indicate the need for randomized trials of rhGM-CSF in allogeneic marrow transplant patients. \nRhabdomyolysis in children: a 3-year retrospective study. The case reports of 4 pediatric patients illustrate the complex clinical scenarios in which childhood rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria occurs. Children ranged in age from 8-18 years. Presumed etiologies of rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria included Neisseria sepsis, exertion-related episodes, dialysis disequilibrium, and diabetic ketoacidosis. No child developed respiratory or renal failure. all children were discharged with normal muscle power, indicating the benign nature of this disease and the importance of aggressive management. \nRenal artery stenosis: preliminary results of treatment with the Strecker stent. Use of the Strecker flexible balloon-expandable tantalum stent for treatment of renal artery stenosis after failed angioplasty or transaortic thromboendarterectomy was evaluated in 10 patients (nine hypertensive, one normotensive). Left (n = 3) and right (n = 5) renal arteries were involved; renal artery stenosis in two patients had developed after kidney transplantation. Indications for stent placement were inadequate immediate postangioplasty response (n = 7), development of considerable restenosis after angioplasty (n = 1), and obstructing intimal flaps following transaortic endarterectomy (n = 2). Stent placement was technically successful (less than 20% residual stenosis) and patency was preserved in eight patients. Of the seven hypertensive patients with successful implantation, two were cured, three had improvement, and two had no change at latest follow-up evaluation (mean, 10.6 months; range, 6-12 months). The Strecker stent may be helpful in treating restenosis after failed revascularization procedures, although the precise indication, true safety, and long-term efficacy of stent placement in renal arteries will not be known until trials with more subjects and longer follow-up periods are completed. \nRest-injected thallium-201 imaging for assessing viability of severe asynergic regions. To evaluate the utility of rest-injected 201Tl initial and delayed images for assessing the viability of severe asynergic regions, we studied 17 patients with apparently prior infarcted myocardium in combination with 99mTc ventriculography before and after revascularization. In 51 regions with severe asynergy, the percent 201Tl uptake was calculated as the ratio of counts on the segment with asynergy to the maximum counts on the normal segment. Eleven of 14 regions with resting 201Tl redistribution (Group 1) had improved wall motion after revascularization. However, 14 of 37 regions without redistribution also improved (Group 2). Twenty-three regions without redistribution or improved wall motion after revascularization (Group 3) had lower regional 201Tl uptake on their delayed images than those in Groups 1 and 2. Moreover, the initial regional uptake of Group 2 was higher than that of Group 3. These results suggest that redistribution on rest-injected 201Tl scans indicates reversibility of severely asynergic myocardium and that high 201Tl uptake in regions without redistribution may predict improvement in wall motion after revascularization. We conclude that 201Tl uptake may be useful as a marker of viability of severe asynergic regions before revascularization. \nFailure of ursodeoxycholic acid to prevent a cholestatic episode in a patient with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis: a study of bile acid metabolism. Ursodeoxycholic acid was administered to a patient with benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis to prevent cholestatic episodes. A detailed study of bile acid metabolism in this patient was carried out in the anicteric and icteric phases before and after ursodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day) administration. Urinary, biliary and serum bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and by high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. During the anicteric phase the daily urinary excretion and serum concentrations of bile acids were within normal ranges, indicating normal hepatic uptake and secretion of bile acids during the cholestasis-free period. Only slight qualitative differences from normal individuals were observed; the relative proportions of deoxycholic acid in the bile and serum were higher, and 12-oxo-lithocholic acid was the predominant urinary bile acid. During the icteric phase a marked increase in the urinary excretion of primary bile acids and C-1, C-2, C-4 and C-6 hydroxylated metabolites was found. Serum bile acid concentrations increased before the rise in bilirubin, suggesting an acute disturbance in bile acid transport at the onset of the cholestatic attack. After ursodeoxycholic acid administration in the anicteric phase, bile became enriched with the exogenous bile acid, but little qualitative change was found in the other metabolites present in the urine, serum or bile during the anicteric or icteric phases. Prolonged administration of ursodeoxycholic acid failed to prevent recurrence of a cholestatic episode, suggesting that in benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis, oral ursodeoxycholic acid may be of little benefit in the treatment or prevention of cholestasis despite marked enrichment of the bile acid pool with this hydrophilic bile acid. \nPhysical and emotional stress associated with components of the infertility investigation: perspectives of professionals and patients. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined patients', nurses', and physicians' perceptions of the physical and emotional difficulty of infertility treatment. DESIGN: A mail survey method was used. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 26 patients, 76 nurses, and 71 physicians from infertility clinics in the United States and Canada. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A rating scale measured the physical and emotional difficulty level of 36 components from the infertility investigation. RESULTS: Nurses rated the emotional and physical distress of patients higher than did patients and physicians, whereas patients rated their distress higher than did physicians. Older nurses and physicians inferred lower levels of physical and emotional distress than did their younger counterparts. A greater breadth of experience with infertility treatments was associated with higher ratings of emotional distress by nurses and lower ratings by physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Patients, nurses, and physicians perceive infertility treatment from unique vantage points creating differences in perceptions that have implications for patient care. Factors including era of professional training, stage of life, and changes resulting from advancing technology are viewed as influencing health care professionals' perceptions of infertility distress. \nRenal hemodynamics and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in normotensive subjects with hypertensive and normotensive parents. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The kidney is important in blood-pressure regulation, but its role in the development of essential hypertension is still subject to debate. We compared renal hemodynamics, measured in terms of the clearance of para-aminohippuric acid and inulin, and the characteristics of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in three groups of normotensive subjects at different degrees of risk for hypertension: 41 subjects with two normotensive parents, 52 with one normotensive and one hypertensive parent, and 61 with two hypertensive parents. The subjects ranged in age from 7 to 32 years. RESULTS. The mean renal blood flow was lower in the subjects with two hypertensive parents than in those with two normotensive parents (mean difference [+/- SE], 198 +/- 61 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; P = 0.002). Moreover, both the filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance were higher in the subjects with two hypertensive parents (filtration fraction: mean difference, 3.0 +/- 1.1 percentage points; P = 0.006; renal vascular resistance: mean difference, 2.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg per deciliter per minute per 1.73 m2; P = 0.006). The subjects with two hypertensive parents had lower plasma concentrations of renin (mean difference, 3.3 +/- 1.6 mU per liter; P = 0.03) and aldosterone (mean difference, 111 +/- 36 pmol per liter; P = 0.003) than those with two normotensive parents. The differences could not be explained by the small differences in blood pressure between the groups. The values in the subjects with one hypertensive and one normotensive parent fell between those for the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Renal vasoconstriction is increased and renin and aldosterone secretion is decreased in young persons at risk for hypertension. These findings support the hypothesis that alterations in renal hemodynamics occur at an early stage in the development of familial hypertension. \nAcute pulmonary embolism in pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation. Acute pulmonary embolism with infarction can delay urgently needed heart transplantation and increase the postoperative pulmonary complications. Few data are available concerning pulmonary embolization in the pediatric patient with end-stage congestive heart failure. Sixty-two consecutive pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation were monitored for evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. Acute pulmonary infarction was documented by ventilation-perfusion scan, pulmonary angiography or pathologic examination in six patients. The prevalence differed by diagnosis; 5 of 36 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 of 20 patients with congenital heart disease developed acute pulmonary embolism with infarction. No significant difference in age at the time of transplantation evaluation, duration of congestive heart failure, presence of cardiac arrhythmias or degree of cardiac dysfunction was seen between patients with and without pulmonary embolism. Two-dimensional echocardiography failed to detect the presence of an intracardiac thrombus in four of the six patients. Two patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction are alive after successful heart transplantation. The remaining four patients died within 6 weeks of initiation of anticoagulant therapy before transplantation could safely be performed. In summary, pediatric patients with end-stage congestive heart failure are at risk for acute pulmonary embolism. No specific clinical factor identified those patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction. Anticoagulant therapy is strongly recommended in the pediatric patient with poor ventricular function awaiting heart transplantation. \nThe role of chronic viral hepatitis in hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Although hepatocellular carcinoma is a relatively uncommon tumor in the United States, it is quite common in sub-Saharan Africa and the Far East, where most cases are associated with infection with the hepatitis B virus. We have studied 99 American patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for evidence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infection and compared these findings to those in a group of matched controls with other cancers. The two groups differed in proportion, with hepatitis B surface antigen in serum being significantly higher in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (7% vs. 0%, p = 0.009). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was also found more frequently in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (13% vs. 2%, p = 0.002). The relative risk for hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients was calculated to be 17.3 and for antibody to hepatitis C virus to be 7.3. The attributable fraction of cases related to the hepatitis B surface antigen carrier state was 6.7% and for patients infected with the hepatitis C virus was 11.4%. Approximately three quarters of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma did not have evidence of either hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus infection. These findings provide strong evidence that hepatitis C virus infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and in the United States may even play a more important role than the hepatitis B virus. \nCompartment syndrome complicating prolonged use of the lithotomy position. Two patients with three postoperative calf compartment syndromes, which followed prolonged lithotomy positioning, will be presented. Potential physiologic mechanisms are described, and a review of current cases in literature are summated. \nChest pain: an evaluation of the initial diagnosis made by 25 Flemish general practitioners. Twenty-five general practitioners collected information on 318 contacts of patients with a new episode of chest pain, discomfort or tightness. A list of complaints, signs and symptoms were checked, together with the initial diagnosis, made by the GP immediately after the physical examination. The initial diagnosis was compared to a follow-up diagnosis. The gain in certainty was also compared. The GP made a correct initial diagnosis in 82% of patients. In 8% there was a clinically important difference, and seven of 17 episodes of oesophageal disease were missed. For their initial diagnosis, the GP scored 74% certain, 20% uncertain and no diagnosis in 6%. For the final diagnosis, these figures were 88%, 8% and 4%. \nEffects of nonionic versus ionic contrast media on complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. To evaluate the effect of contrast agents on percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) complications, 913 patients undergoing 1,058 separate PTCA procedures were prospectively randomized to receive either nonionic iopamidol (Isovue-370) [n = 507 PTCA procedures] or ionic contrast media, meglumine sodium diatrizoate (Renografin-76) [n = 551 PTCA procedures]. Angioplasty operators, technicians, nurses and patients were blinded to the agent used. All patients were pretreated with 0.6 mg of atropine sulfate intravenously before any contrast injections. Hypotension (mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg associated with contrast injections) occurred during 8.5% of PTCA procedures in which the patients were receiving iopamidol and during 9.5% of the procedures in which the patients were given diatrizoate (difference not significant). Bradycardia (heart rate of less than 40 beats/min associated with contrast injections) developed during 5.7% of procedures when patients were given iopamidol and during 5.1% of procedures when patients were given diatrizoate (difference not significant). The need for additional atropine or temporary pacing during the procedure was similar for patients given iopamidol and diatrizoate. The overall incidence of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or both, during the procedure occurred less frequently when iopamidol was used compared with diatrizoate (1 vs 2.5%, p = 0.045). These serious ventricular arrhythmias were attributable to contrast injections in 0.6% of the PTCA procedures when iopamidol was given and in 2.0% of the cases in which diatrizoate was the contrast agent (p = 0.09). Only 1 patient had an allergic reaction to the contrast agent, and this was in a patient who received iopamidol. \nMonocrotaline-induced angiogenesis. Differences in the bronchial and pulmonary vasculature. Vascular corrosion casting was used to search for angiogenesis in the blood vessels of the lungs of rats given monocrotaline. Animals treated with monocrotaline had new well-differentiated arteries and veins on their pleural surfaces. Animals not treated had no large vessel on their pleural surfaces. Animals receiving monocrotaline had capillaries around major arteries that were more dense, widened, and less tubular than normal. These capillaries occasionally occurred in sheets and had blind endings. The control animals had delicate, uniform, tubular capillaries. Alveolar capillaries in both groups showed no evidence of increase in size or number or change in shape. Light microscopy confirmed the finding of new vessels found with the casts. The finding of angiogenesis on the pleural surface and in the bronchovascular bundle, but not in the alveolar capillaries, suggests a basic difference in how these capillary beds respond to angiogenic stimuli. If alveolar capillaries are unable to undergo angiogenesis, concepts of lung development and tumor growth may be significantly altered. The lung may be a unique organ to study angiogenesis because of the different angiogenic potential of its two circulations. Study of these differences may lead to better understanding of inhibition of angiogenesis. \nPancreaticobronchial fistula causing lung abscess: case report and brief discussion of the literature. A case report of a patient with an abscess of the lung caused by a pancreaticobronchial fistula is presented. The patient was treated by pulmonary resection and distal pancreatectomy-splenectomy. \nValproate-induced coma with ketosis and carnitine insufficiency. We observed two patients who developed coma following administration of valproate in dosages of 32 to 40 mg/kg per day. Valproate levels were within the therapeutic range, and results of liver function studies were normal. Both patients had ketosis and adipic aciduria. Plasma free carnitine levels were decreased during coma and after recovery. One patient excreted ethylmalonic acid, butyrylcarnitine, and glutarylcarnitine during and after resolution of coma, suggesting a multiple acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenation defect. Low serum carnitine levels may predispose patients to development of altered consciousness when treated with valproate. \nThe kissing balloon technique with two over-the-wire balloon catheters through a single 8-French guiding catheter. Some of the newer over-the-wire coronary angioplasty catheters have shaft sizes of 3.0 French (F) or less. The inner diameter of modern 8-F guiding catheters is large enough to accommodate two of such balloon catheters. We report a kissing balloon procedure with two over-the-wire catheters through a single 8-F guiding catheter. \nAutotransplantation of dispersed pancreatic islet tissue combined with total or near-total pancreatectomy for treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is difficult to treat in patients with a nondilated duct. Patients experiencing intractable pain unresponsive to or judged untreatable by lesser procedures must decide between total pancreatectomy and resultant diabetes or a continuation of their pancreatitis. From 1977 through 1990, 26 patients underwent extensive pancreatectomy and dispersed pancreatic islet tissue autotransplantation for treatment of chronic pancreatitis pain and prophylaxis of surgical diabetes. Of these 26 patients, total (Whipple) or near-total (greater than 95%) pancreatectomy was performed in 24 patients. Of these 24 patients, pain relief could be assessed in 21 patients at 5 to 155 months (mean, 5.7 years), and 19 patients (90%) reported partial or complete remission. Of the patients who underwent total or near-total pancreatectomy, islets were injected intraportally in 22 patients and into the renal subcapsule in two patients. The latter two patients have required insulin since surgery. Of the other 22, one patient died from a complication of the pancreatectomy. Nine of the 21 evaluable recipients of intraportal islet autografts were insulin independent for at least several months after surgery. Five patients are currently insulin independent at 6 years, 4 years, 1.5 years, 9 months, and 5 months after surgery. Of the other four patients, one patient died insulin independent at 6 years, and three patients required insulin beginning 8 to 18 months after surgery. Insulin independence correlated with the number of islets recovered, which in turn correlated inversely with the degree of pancreatic fibrosis. Of our four most recent patients, three patients had mildly to moderately fibrotic glands, and higher numbers of islets were obtained. After total (Whipple) pancreatectomy, these three patients are insulin independent. A liver biopsy was performed in one patient 8 months after total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation; numerous clusters of islet cells staining strongly for insulin and glucagon were detected within portal triads on both wedge and needle biopsy specimens. Morbidity related to the intraportal-dispersed pancreatic islet tissue transplantation was low (no disseminated intravascular coagulation, significant portal hypertension, or hepatic dysfunction). Islet autotransplantation can be an effective and safe adjunct to extensive pancreatic resection for those patients who risk surgical diabetes for relief of their chronic pancreatitis pain. \nRecombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator followed by heparin compared with heparin alone for refractory unstable angina pectoris. Patients with unstable angina pectoris who remain symptomatic despite medical treatment are at high risk of death and myocardial infarction. The incidence of refractory unstable angina was examined in a consecutive series of 103 patients who received conventional medical treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists and aspirin. During 48 hours of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, 24 patients had greater than or equal to 1 anginal attack, 5 of whom had both painful and painless ischemic episodes. In these 24 patients with unstable angina refractory to conventional medical treatment, the short-term efficacy of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) followed by heparin was assessed and compared with heparin alone in a randomized double-blind trial. Recurrences of ischemic attacks during a 72-hour follow-up period were documented in 9 of the 12 patients given heparin alone. All patients experienced at least 1 symptomatic ischemic episode and 1 patient had both painful and painless ischemia. No patient given rt-PA plus heparin had either symptomatic or asymptomatic ischemic attacks during follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves analysis demonstrated a significantly higher probability of being ischemia free in the group of patients treated with rt-PA followed by heparin than in the group treated with heparin alone (p less than 0.01). Quantitative coronary arteriography failed to reveal any significant changes of ischemia-related lesions before and after each treatment. This study demonstrates that the combination of rt-PA and heparin has a greater protective effect than heparin alone in treating recurrent ischemic episodes in patients with refractory unstable angina. \nPreoperative high-dose leucovorin/5-fluorouracil and radiation therapy for unresectable rectal cancer. Twenty patients with primary or recurrent unresectable rectal cancer limited to the pelvis were entered on a Phase I trial of preoperative pelvic radiation therapy (RT) (5040 cGy) and two cycles of combined high-dose leucovorin (LV) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), followed by surgery and ten cycles of postoperative LV/5-FU (sequential). Maximum tolerated doses (MTD) were determined for preoperative combined LV/5-FU and RT and for postoperative sequential LV/5-FU. 5-FU was escalated 50 mg/m2 while the LV remained constant at 200 mg/m2. The initial doses of 5-FU were combined LV/5-FU and RT (200 mg/m2) and sequential LV/5-FU (325 mg/m2). The median follow-up time was 14 months. The resectability rate was 89%, and the pathologic complete response rate was 21%. The MTD for combined LV/5-FU and RT was 300 mg/m2; therefore, the recommended dose of 5-FU is 250 mg/m2. The recommended dose of 5-FU for sequential LV/5-FU is 375 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicities in this trial were diarrhea, tenesmus, increased bowel movements, dysuria, and myelosuppression. For the six patients who received 5-FU at the recommended dose level, the median low counts were leukocyte count, 3.7/microliters (range, 2.4 to 4.9/microliters); hemoglobin, 9.0 g/dl (range, 8.2 to 11.9 g/dl); and platelet count (X1000), 146/microliters (range, 89 to 182/microliters). The incidence rate of any Grade 3 toxicity was 17% (diarrhea and frequent bowel movements). The recommended doses of 5-FU used in this protocol were well tolerated. Because there was a long delay before optimal doses of 5-FU could be delivered, the authors do not recommend that high-dose LV be used in conjunction with combined 5-FU and RT with the treatment regimen as currently designed. However, because the resectability and complete response rates were higher than those previously reported for preoperative RT alone, the authors are encouraged by the combined technique approach. New trials are currently being undertaken to determine if the use of a low-dose LV regimen is more tolerable. \nSiriraj stroke score and validation study to distinguish supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage from infarction. OBJECTIVES--To develop a simple, reliable, and safe diagnostic tool for acute stroke syndromes in a setting where computerised brain scanning was not readily available and to validate its accuracy with regard to pathological types of stroke. DESIGN--13 clinical variables that potentially might differentiate supratentorial cerebral haemorrhage from infarction were recorded and tested by multivariate analysis in a prospective study of 174 patients with acute stroke. In developing the Siriraj stroke score stepwise discriminant analysis of the variables was followed by a linear discriminant equation to differentiate between supratentorial haemorrhage and infarction. The score obtained was validated against scores in 206 other patients with stroke, computerised brain scans being used for definitive diagnosis. SETTING--Siriraj Hospital Medical School, Mahidol University, Bangkok. SUBJECTS--Prospective study: 174 consecutive patients with acute supratentorial stroke syndrome (not subarachnoid haemorrhage) admitted to Siriraj Hospital during 1984-5; validation study: 206 patients admitted to Siriraj Hospital or another hospital for supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage or infarction. RESULTS--The Siriraj stroke score was developed and calculated as (2.5 x level of consciousness) + (2 x vomiting) + (2 x headache) + (0.1 x diastolic blood pressure) - (3 x atheroma markers) - 12. A score above 1 indicates supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage, while a score below -1 indicates infarction. The score between 1 and -1 represents an equivocal result needing a computerised brain scan or probability curve to verify the diagnosis. In the validation study of the Siriraj stroke score the diagnostic sensitivities of the score for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction were 89.3% and 93.2% respectively, with an overall predictive accuracy of 90.3%. CONCLUSION--The Siriraj stroke score is widely accepted and applied in hospitals throughout Thailand as a simple and reliable bedside method for diagnosing acute stroke. \nDifferential modulation by the stress axis of ethanol withdrawal seizure expression in WSP and WSR mice. Withdrawal from both acute and chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure is associated with increased neural excitability and increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. There is some evidence that glucocorticoids are necessary for EtOH withdrawal seizure expression. Lines of mice that were selected for severe (WSP) and minimal (WSR) EtOH withdrawal (as estimated from handling-induced convulsion scores) have been shown to differ in their stress response following an acute dose of EtOH. In this study we provide evidence that these lines of mice also differ in their sensitivity to the excitatory effects of glucocorticoids. EtOH withdrawal seizures of WSP mice were significantly increased by chronic and acute corticosterone treatment, whereas those of the WSR mice were unaffected. Neural excitability was decreased in the WSP mice when aminoglutethimide, a glucocorticoid synthesis blocker, was administered. Thus, it appears that genetic differences in EtOH withdrawal seizure severity may be due, in part, to differences in sensitivity to the excitatory effects of glucocorticoids. \nTreatment of critically ill patients with sepsis of unknown cause: value of percutaneous cholecystostomy. Because of the difficulty in diagnosing acute cholecystitis in critically ill patients with severe intercurrent illness by clinical and imaging methods or percutaneous aspiration of the gallbladder, a trial of percutaneous cholecystostomy was performed in 24 patients in the intensive-care unit with persistent, unexplained sepsis after a complete clinical, laboratory, and radiologic search showed no alternative source of infection. Persistent high fevers, despite antibiotic therapy, were present in all patients, with elevated WBC count in",
