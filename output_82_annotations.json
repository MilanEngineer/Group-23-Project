        "text": " This inhibitory effect was only observed when MCF7 and T47D cells were cultivated in medium containing steroid-depleted serum. The growth of a MCF7 variant capable of growth in serum-free medium was also inhibited by BIM23014, indicating that serum factors are not required for this inhibition. In the serum-free medium, the addition of estradiol before or during treatment with BIM23014 abolished its inhibitory effects on cell growth. The studies including time course, competitive inhibition, and cross-linking of iodinated BIM23014 to its receptor revealed a specific binding on MCF7 cells and showed a single 57,000 mol wt protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results support the hypothesis that BIM23014 inhibits the growth of steroid-receptor positive cells of human breast cancers through its own receptor in estradiol-free conditions. \nCoronary vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage as a cause of stunned myocardium. Case report. A patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage was found to have electrocardiographic abnormalities resembling an acute myocardial infarction as well as left ventriculographic findings of cardiac dysfunction. These cardiac abnormalities resolved following surgical clipping of the aneurysm and the patient recovered well from the operation. She died 2 months later from cancer and a postmortem examination at that time revealed no evidence of myocardial necrosis. In this report, the authors discuss coronary vasospasm and reversible postischemic \"stunned myocardium,\" a condition that has not been considered previously in relation to subarachnoid hemorrhage. \nHypertrophy and increased gene expression of neurons containing neurokinin-B and substance-P messenger ribonucleic acids in the hypothalami of postmenopausal women. We have previously described hypertrophy of neurons containing estrogen receptor mRNA in the infundibular nucleus of postmenopausal women. In the present investigation we identified peptide mRNAs in the hypertrophied neurons and determined whether postmenopausal neuronal hypertrophy was accompanied by changes in gene expression. In the first study in situ hybridization was performed on sections from hypothalami of postmenopausal women (n = 3) using synthetic 35S-labeled cDNA probes complementary to mRNAs encoding estrogen receptor, substance-P (SP), neurokinin-B (NKB), POMC, cholecystokinin, dynorphin, CRF, enkephalin, galanin, neuropeptide-Y, GH-releasing hormone, and tyrosine hydroxylase. Neuronal cross-sectional areas and cell densities were measured with the aid of a computer microscope system. Neurons labeled with the NKB and SP probes were comparable in size, morphology, and distribution to the hypertrophied neurons containing estrogen receptor mRNA. In contrast, neurons labeled with other cDNA probes were sparsely distributed (CRF and dynorphin), smaller in size (neuropeptide-Y, galanin, GH-releasing hormone, enkephalin, cholecystokinin, and POMC), or located anterior to the hypertrophied population (tyrosine hydroxylase). In the second study sections from hypothalami of premenopausal (n = 3) and postmenopausal (n = 3) women were incubated with cDNA probes complementary to SP or NKB mRNAs. The mean cross-sectional areas of postmenopausal infundibular neurons containing NKB and SP mRNAs increased to 194% and 176% of premenopausal values, respectively. The autoradiographic grain densities of infundibular neurons labeled with either probe were also significantly increased in the postmenopausal group. Finally, the numbers of labeled neurons/tissue increased 6-fold (SP) and 15-fold (NKB) in the postmenopausal infundibular nucleus. These data demonstrate that human menopause is associated with marked increases in hypothalamic NKB and SP gene expression. We propose that neurons containing estrogen receptor, SP, and NKB mRNAs participate in the hypothalamic circuitry regulating estrogen negative feedback in the human. \nRelation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin: a case-control study. We conducted a case-control study in five general hospitals in the region of Antwerp, studying 161 patients (102 men, 59 women) and hospital control subjects matched for age and sex to explore the relation between drug use and upper gastrointestinal bleeding from 'erosive lesions' (peptic oesophagitis, gastric erosions, gastric ulcer(s), or duodenal ulcer(s]. There was a highly significant difference between cases and control subjects in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, excluding aspirin) (odds ratio 7.4, p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval odds ratio 3.7 to 14.7). There also was a significant difference in the use of aspirin (odds ratio 2.2, p = 0.025; 95% CI odds ratio 1.3 to 4.0) and a highly significant difference regarding the presence of antecedents of peptic ulcer disease (odds ratio 5.5, p less than 0.001; 95% CI odds ratio 3.2 to 9.6). There was no significant difference in the use of other drugs, paracetamol and corticosteroids in particular, nor in the use of alcohol or tobacco. The patient group using NSAIDs was older, had more women, and had a higher mortality than the group not using NSAIDs. Among patients with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer(s), NSAID users were not more or less likely to have had symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, and had no higher frequency of multiple gastric or duodenal ulcers. The attributable risk for NSAID use was 0.30 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.37) and for aspirin use 0.14 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.20). \nCoronary arteriography in patients with dextrocardia. Coronary arteriography is described in a patient with dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis. Six cases of coronary arteriography in dextrocardia were reviewed from the literature, and 3 other cases were reported from the authors' institutions. In 9 of the 10 patients, coronary arteriography was performed without difficulty using standard Judkins or Sones catheters. Angiographers encountering patients with dextrocardia may use standard coronary arteriographic techniques with a few subtle modifications. \nRenal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval involvement. Renal cell carcinoma extends into the lumen of the inferior vena cava in approximately 4% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Surgical removal of the intracaval tumor thrombus with radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for this malignancy. From January 1977 to June 1990, 31 such patients were examined for combined problems of renal carcinoma and intracaval tumor extension. Twenty-six of these patients underwent radical nephrectomy and vena caval thrombectomy. Ten patients had tumor thrombus confined to the infrahepatic vena cava, 11 had retrohepatic caval involvement, and 5 had extension to the level of the diaphragm or into the right atrium. Surgical approach was dictated by the level of caval involvement. Control of the suprahepatic vena cava plus temporary occlusion of hepatic arterial and portal venous inflow were necessary in some cases; cardiopulmonary bypass was required for transatrial removal of more extensive tumors. Five of the 26 patients had evidence before operation of distant metastatic disease; none of these survived beyond 12 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of the 21 patients without known preoperative metastatic disease was 57%. Complete surgical excision of all gross tumor appears to be critical for long-term survival in these patients. \nGastric cancer after gastric bypass for obesity. Case report. We describe a patient in whom gastric cancer developed after gastric bypass for morbid obesity. In addition, we review the literature to emphasize the technical problems involved in diagnosing disease in the excluded portion of the stomach. \nDepressed adenoma of the stomach. Conceptual review and study of five cases. Depressed gastric adenoma is a recently featured lesion, distinguished by a depression in the gastric mucosa, with histologic changes of conventional adenomatous polyp. We observed five cases of depressed gastric adenoma, one of them associated with a peptic ulcer, another with a gastric stump, and yet another with an early gastric carcinoma. None of the cases was detected clinically by radiology or endoscopic study. Endoscopically, this lesion stimulates a peptic ulcer at a re-epithelialization stage or an early carcinoma of the depressed type. Histologically, all the cases showed dysplastic changes of varying degrees, with a relevant risk of malignancy. A similarity is shown to other lesions described in the gastric mucosa. \nMaxillofacial considerations in orthotopic liver transplantation. Orthotopic liver transplantation is now a widely used treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease. Lifelong pharmacologic immunosuppression renders these patients susceptible to many infections. The purpose of this article is to provide guidelines for treating the patient with end-stage liver disease, both before and after transplantation. In addition, we shall discuss some of the medical implications associated with end-stage liver disease and their clinical presentations and appropriate presurgical management. Adverse side effects of long-term immunosuppression and their effect on the oral and maxillofacial region shall also be discussed. Last, a brief discussion of FK506, the latest immunosuppressant, will be presented together with the implications of its use on our surgical treatment of these patients. \nPrevalence of asthma among 12 year old children in New Zealand and South Wales: a comparative survey. A survey of 12 year old schoolchildren was carried out in New Zealand and South Wales, the same questionnaire and exercise provocation test being used. The prevalence of a history of asthma at any time was higher in New Zealand (147/873, 17%) than in South Wales (116/965, 12%). The New Zealand children were also more likely than the Welsh children to have a history of \"wheeze ever\" (27% versus 22%), and wheeze brought on by running (15% versus 10.5%). The sex ratio of asthmatic and wheezy children was very similar in the two countries. A history of hospital admission for chest trouble was twice as common in New Zealand as in South Wales. An exercise test produced a fall in peak expiratory flow rate of 15% or more in more New Zealand children (12.2%) than Welsh children (7.7%). These results suggest that the prevalence of childhood asthma is higher in New Zealand than in South Wales. \nProliferation and cytolytic function of anti-CD3 + interleukin-2 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells following bone marrow transplantation. We evaluated the proliferation, cytolytic function, and phenotypic characteristics of anti-CD3 plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 44 patients with leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with multiagent chemotherapy or following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). BMT patients had decreased cell growth with only a 1.35 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), 1.24 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for NHL), and 0.8 +/- 0.1 (allogeneic BMT for leukemia) mean fold increase by day 5 of culture compared with controls (4.0 +/- 0.4), P less than .001. Anti-CD3 + IL-2 activated cells from patients with ALL and NHL who had received autologous BMT and cells from patients with leukemia who underwent allogeneic BMT were more effective in lysing the natural killer (NK) sensitive target, K562, and the NK-resistant target, Daudi, compared with controls. In contrast, cytolysis of K562 and Daudi by cultured PBMCs from patients with ALL and NHL receiving multi-agent chemotherapy was similar to that of controls. Cultures from BMT recipients had a significant increase in CD16+ (autologous ALL 5.7 +/- 1.5%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 12.4 +/- 3.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 14.3 +/- 2.9%, P less than .001) and CD56+ cells (autologous ALL 27.6 +/- 12.0%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 39.3 +/- 9.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 42.7 +/- 7.4%, P less than .001) compared with controls (CD16+ 2.5 +/- 0.4%; CD56+ 6.9 +/- 0.9%). Stimulation of PBMCs with anti-CD3 + IL-2 is effective in generating cells with high cytolytic function post-BMT. \nThe management of transitional cell carcinoma in solitary renal units. Ten patients with urothelial malignancies involving a solitary functioning renal unit were treated at our center for an average of 24 months or until death. These patients were all managed by parenchyma-sparing methods, including percutaneous as well as ureteroscopic tumor resection. Of our patients 9 have received adjunctive chemotherapy in the form of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations. At the time of this report 5 of our patients were alive without evidence of disease, 4 were alive with evidence of either residual or recurrent neoplasia and 1 was dead of disease 5 years after original presentation. Patients with higher grade tumors or carcinoma in situ did less well than patients with low grade disease. We present an analysis of our experience with this complex patient population and discuss the implications of these data within the context of a growing literature on the topic of upper tract urothelial malignancy. \nPerioperative stroke. Part I: General surgery, carotid artery disease, and carotid endarterectomy. Although stroke, defined as a focal neurological deficit lasting more than 24 hr, is uncommon in the perioperative period, its associated mortality and long-term disability are high. No large-scale data are available to identify the importance of recognized risk factors for stroke in the perioperative period. A review of the literature shows that the incidence and mechanism of its occurrence are influenced by the presence of cardiovascular disease and the type of surgery. The most common cause of perioperative stroke is embolism. In non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of perioperative stroke is higher among the elderly. Properly administered, controlled hypotension is associated with minimal risk of stroke. Cerebral vasospasm may be the cause of focal cerebral ischaemia in eclamptic patients, and the aggressive treatment of hypertension may exacerbate the neurological damage. The risk of stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy is closely related to the preoperative neurological presentation, and the experience of the surgical/anaesthetic team. Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, acute stroke, asymptomatic carotid lesions, preoperative assessment of risk, local and general anaesthesia, cerebral protection and monitoring during carotid endarterectomy are discussed with reference to reducing the risk of perioperative stroke. Adequate monitoring and protection have minimized the risk of ischaemia from carotid clamping, and the major mechanism of stroke is embolization. \nRestenosis after coronary angioplasty: an overview. Despite substantial basic and clinical efforts to address the problem of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention, effective preventive therapies have not yet been developed. Nevertheless, the accumulated information has provided much insight into the process of restenosis in addition to allowing standards to be developed for adequate clinical trials. The pathophysiology of restenosis increasingly appears to be distinct from that of primary atherosclerosis. Restenosis involves elastic recoil, incorporation of thrombus into the lesion and fibrocellular proliferation in varying degrees in different patients. Lack of an animal model that satisfactorily mimics restenosis is a major impediment to further understanding of the process. Clinical studies are hampered by difficulties in finding a single unifying definition of restenosis and by variable methods of reporting follow-up. Reporting of clinical outcomes of all patients in angiographic substudies would allow a more satisfactory interpretation of the results of clinical trials. Current noninvasive test results are not accurate enough to substitute for angiographic and clinical outcome data in intervention trials. In the majority of observational studies, only diabetes and unstable angina have emerged as consistently associated with restenosis; whereas most of the standard risk factors for atherosclerosis have a less consistent relation. Disappointingly, the new atherectomy and laser technologies have not affected restenosis rates. The one possible exception is coronary stenting, as a result of the larger luminal diameter achieved by the placement of the stent. In conclusion, although substantial continued effort is necessary to explore the basic aspects of cellular proliferation and mechanical alteration of atherosclerotic vessels, attention to the principles of clinical trials and observation are required to detect the impact of risk factors and interventions on the multifactorial problem of restenosis. Adequate sample sizes, collection of clinical and angiographic outcomes and factorial study designs hold promise for unraveling this important limitation of percutaneous intervention. \nCrescentic glomerulonephritis in Wegener's granulomatosis: morphology, therapy, outcome. Fourteen patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and severe renal and extrarenal involvement were studied (serum creatinine on admission 5.8 +/- 3.4 mg/dl). Renal histology showed a necrotizing, crescentic glomerulonephritis in all patients. Despite advanced renal disease on admission cyclophosphamide, steroids (in 13 patients) and plasma exchange (in 9 patients) caused a rapid and sustained improvement of renal function. Four patients required intermittent hemodialysis over a period of one week. After 2 weeks of treatment serum creatinine values below 2 mg/dl (n = 4) indicated a nearly complete recovery of renal function in the long-term follow up (mean serum creatinine achieved after 12 months therapy: 1.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl (n = 4). Therefore serum creatinine values observed after 2 weeks of therapy, appear to be of prognostic value with regard to renal outcome. No relapse of active WG or progressive renal deterioration was observed during follow-up (22 +/- 13 months) except in one patient with persisting renal impairment. Three patients died (staphylococcus sepsis, intracerebral hemorrhage during hypertensive crisis, pulmonary embolism) during the first two months of therapy. The decline of serum creatinine seemed to be a better indicator of successful therapy than the decrease of anticytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hematuria. On admission ANCA titer neither correlated with serum creatinine, the degree of renal involvement, nor was it of prognostic value. ANCA, serum creatinine and hematuria normalized within 2 to 8 months, whereas ESR and proteinuria remained elevated. Our data indicate a good prognosis of WG even with advanced renal involvement and generalized vasculitis provided aggressive treatment is performed early. \nThe Istituto Rizzoli-Beretta experience with osteosarcoma of the jaw. Twenty-eight osteosarcomas (OS) of the jaw were reported. There were 15 male and 13 female patients (age range, 9 to 68 years; mean, 36.9 years); 57.1% of the patients were older than 30 years of age. Swelling was the most frequent symptom; it was reported on an average of 6 months before diagnosis. Most of the tumors of the maxilla (eight patients) occurred in the alveolar ridge (six of eight). In the mandible (20 patients), the body was the preferred site (11 of 20). Radiographically most of the lesions were either lytic and sclerotic or only lytic. Histologically, 12 cases (42.9%) were osteoblastic osteosarcoma, ten (35.8%) were chondroblastic, four (14.3%) were fibroblastic, and two (7%) were round cell OS. Of the 28 cases, three (10.7%) were low grade, and 25 (89.3%) were high grade. Thirteen patients had intralesional surgery, and 13 had marginal surgery as their initial treatment. Recurrence was the rule in the first group, and it was 69% in the second group. Twenty patients (71%) died, and eight are alive. Of these, two are alive with disease. In the six patients who are alive and disease-free, all but one had marginal to wide surgical margins at the time of the first procedure or wide margins at the time of the recurrences along with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In the patient in which the surgical margins were marginal, the lesion was small 2.5 X 2 cm. This patient was alive without evidence of disease after 9 years of follow-up. \nAccuracy of a mixed venous saturation catheter during acutely induced changes in hematocrit in humans. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of in vivo mixed venous hemoglobin saturation (Svo2) measurements with a fiber optic thermodilution catheter during acute changes in hematocrit. DESIGN: Comparison of fiberoptic in vivo Svo2 values with in vitro Svo2 values obtained with a multiwavelength spectrophotometer. SETTING: Operating room in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Six consecutive patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Before and after each step of hypervolemic hemodilution and after every 500 mL of blood loss, blood gases were analyzed and hemodynamic, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and in vitro and in vivo Svo2 measurements were made. Hematocrit values were measured in the range of 40% to 18%. Plotting all in vivo Svo2 values (n = 74) against the in vitro Svo2 measurements obtained during the entire study period gives r2 = .86. The accuracy of in vivo Svo2 measurements was not affected by changes in hematocrit or cardiac output. The Svo2 catheter value at the beginning of the study differed from the in vitro Svo2 value by -0.86 +/- 2.56% and at the end of the study period of 8 to 10 hrs by 0.71 +/- 3.04%. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the studied fiberoptic continuous measuring Svo2 system was not affected by changes in hematocrit or cardiac output. No significant drift in the in vitro Svo2 measurements was observed. \nValproate in the treatment of persistent chronic daily headache. An open label study. Thirty patients with persistent chronic daily headache, unresponsive to various combinations of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment were selected for an open label study using divalproex sodium. All patients had normal liver function tests. After a baseline observation period of 1 month, patients were given divalproex sodium 1000 to 2000 mg per day, for a period of 3 months. Blood valproic acid levels were kept between 75 and 100 mcg/ml. Liver function studies and blood ammonia levels were obtained periodically. Based on weekly headache index, headache-free days, dysfunctional days and patients' general well-being rating and physicians' global assessment, two thirds of the patients improved significantly. The common side effects included weight gain, tremor, hair loss and nausea. Liver functions were unaffected by treatment. The possible mechanism of action of valproate in headache is discussed. Valproate appears to be a worthwhile addition to the prophylactic treatment of chronic recurrent headache. \nNormal P300 following extensive damage to the left medial temporal lobe. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during auditory and visual \"oddball\" tasks from a patient with a severe verbal memory deficit due to a low grade infiltrating glioma which involved the full extent of the left medial temporal lobe. In both sensory modalities, the patient's oddball-evoked P300s were symmetrical and of normal amplitude. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the hippocampus, or any other medial temporal structure, makes a substantial contribution to the scalp P300. \nAcid secretory changes and early relapse following duodenal ulcer healing with ranitidine or sucralfate. Controversial aspects relating to acid secretory changes following duodenal ulcer healing, and the effect of histamine-2 (H2)-receptor blockers on such changes are discussed. Recent studies comparing the effects of ranitidine or sucralfate on changes in the acid secretory responses in the healing of duodenal ulcers are described, and the relevance of these changes to early relapse considered. The duration of therapy and timing of acid-secretory studies and endoscopies are standardized in all studies, but the acid-secretory parameters vary. These comprised acid secretory responses to graded doses of an intravenous infusion of pentagastrin or histamine, sham-feeding responses, and basal and nocturnal acid secretion. In all studies, healing with sucralfate was associated with a significant decrease in the various parameters of acid secretion. In the ranitidine-healed groups, no appreciable decrease was noted and there was, indeed, a significant increase in nocturnal acid secretion. Routine endoscopies performed 4-6 weeks after documented ulcer healing showed a recurrence of 3 of the 32 (9%) sucralfate-healed and in 14 of the 35 (40%) ranitidine-healed ulcers. Increased acid secretory responsiveness following duodenal ulcer healing was strongly correlated with subsequent early relapse. \nMulticentric osteolysis: an infrequently recognized renal-rheumatologic syndrome. We describe the case of a young girl with Type III multicentric osteolysis, a rare syndrome characterized by osteolysis and renal insufficiency. Our report is intended to make physicians aware of this uncommon cause of renal and rheumatologic abnormalities. \nManagement of low-grade cervical dysplasia during pregnancy. Fifty-five pregnant patients referred to my colposcopy service from 1985 to 1990 for biopsy-proven mild dysplasia were entered into a program of serial evaluations, including Pap test, colposcopy, and directed biopsy if indicated. The evaluations were done every 12 weeks during pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum to rule out new or occult invasive cervical cancer. By the time the postpartum biopsy was done, no such cancer had been detected. All 55 patients had mild dysplasia or less. I conclude that pregnant patients with biopsy-proven mild cervical dysplasia who have had adequate expert colposcopy and results of Pap test consistent with biopsy require only one antepartum colposcopy prior to postpartum reevaluation and treatment. Multiple interval cytologic and colposcopic studies with or without biopsy are unnecessary. The likelihood of invasive cervical cancer developing in these patients during pregnancy is negligible. \nTranscortical aphasia. Importance of the nonspeech dominant hemisphere in language repetition. While a relative preservation of repetition in acute transcortical aphasia (TA) has usually been associated with the functional integrity of the speech dominant (left) perisylvian area, recent amytal data (Bando et al., 1986) have suggested a fundamental role of the nondominant (right) hemisphere in language repetition. The neuroradiological correlates of repetition were studied in a consecutive series of 21 patients with acute TA. A similar frequency of either perisylvian or extraperisylvian pathology was found. In 2 patients with perisylvian pathology, the injection of amytal in the hemisphere contralateral to the lesion abolished repetition. Positron emission tomography (PET) in another patient revealed marked hypometabolism over the entire left cortical mantle ipsilateral to a basal ganglia lesion, suggesting that preserved repetition was carried out by right hemisphere structures. This was confirmed in a second patient with left extraperisylvian pathology, in whom a second lesion in the right hemisphere resulted in impaired repetition. These findings suggest that the spared contralateral hemisphere may subserve residual repetition in some transcortical aphasic patients with a lesion within or outside the speech-dominant perisylvian area. \nRetinal detachment adherent to posterior chamber IOL after Molteno implant surgery. A patient with refractory glaucoma 1 year after cataract extraction and trabeculectomy had Molteno implant surgery. Three days after surgery a kissing choroidal effusion and retinal detachment adherent to the posterior chamber IOL were detected. Repeated choroidal taps were unsuccessful. Removal of the Molteno implant, vitrectomy, and silicone oil injection were required to reattach the retina. \nDesmoplastic small cell tumors of the peritoneum coexpressing mesenchymal and epithelial markers. Desmoplastic small cell tumors arising diffusely within the abdomen and lacking an apparent organ of origin are rare. Most previously reported cases occurred in children, but young adult patients also have been described. Light microscopic examination shows the tumors to be composed of nests of small cells surrounded by an abundant desmoplastic stroma. Immunohistochemical findings reveal multidirectional differentiation with coexpression of cytokeratin, milk fat globule, neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7, desmin, and vimentin. Electron microscopic examination demonstrates paranuclear condensations of intermediate filaments. The authors describe two patients who died of their disease, despite aggressive chemotherapy and surgical intervention. \nDetection of hepatitis B virus DNA sequences in liver in HBsAg seronegative patients with liver disease with and without anti-HBc antibodies. Excluding studies from Brechot and co-workers, little support has been found for a role of the hepatitis B virus in the pathogenesis of HBsAg seronegative patients with predominantly chronic liver diseases, including primary liver cancer. In this study liver DNA from 59 predominantly British patients (four cases with paired biopsies, 6-12 months apart) with different, mostly chronic, liver diseases was analysed by molecular hybridization. All were seronegative for HBsAg and serum hepatitis B virus DNA (dot blot hybridization) and their liver diseases were believed to be unrelated to hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in liver of 11 (18.6 per cent) patients; nine had episomal (3.2 Kb) DNA and eight had higher molecular weight bands suggesting integrated forms. Six patients were also seronegative for anti-HBc. Patients of UK and non-UK origin were equally represented. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in serum of six of nine patients tested using the polymerase chain reaction. The detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in liver and in serum by this assay in a significant proportion of patients with chronic liver disease, hitherto unsuspected of being hepatitis B virus-related, suggests a possible role for this virus in low- as well as high-prevalence countries. \nImpairment of natural killer functions by interleukin 6 increases lymphoblastoid cell tumorigenicity in athymic mice. Expression of the human IL-6 gene in EBV-immortalized normal human B lymphocytes following retroviral-mediated transduction rendered these cells highly tumorigenic in athymic mice. The tumors were lymphomas composed of the originally inoculated human lymphoblastoid cells. Co-injection of IL-6 expressing EBV-immortalized cells with IL-6 nonexpressing control cells resulted in increased tumorigenicity of the IL-6 nonexpressing cells. The lymphoblastoid cells expressing IL-6 were indistinguishable from parental cell lines in morphology and in a variety of cell surface characteristics, and did not exhibit growth advantage over parental cell lines in vitro, such that increased tumorigenicity is unlikely to depend upon a direct oncogenic effect of IL-6 on the B cells. Rather, at high concentrations, IL-6 markedly inhibits human lymphoblastoid cell killing by IL-2-activated murine splenocytes in vitro, suggesting that IL-6-related tumorigenicity might depend upon IL-6 inhibiting cytotoxicity at the tumor site. Thus, production of IL-6 by tumor cells that results in natural killer cell dysfunctions illustrates a novel mechanism of tumor cell escape from immune surveillance. \nRacial differences in HLA antigen frequency and hypertensive renal failure. Black patients with hypertension are six times more likely to develop end-stage renal disease than are their white counterparts. To determine if genetic differences associated with the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system account for racial variation in hypertensive renal failure, we examined antigenic frequencies from a large renal transplant registry. Human Leukocyte Antigen phenotypes from cadaveric renal transplant recipients and donors in the South Eastern Organ Procurement Foundation database from 1982 to 1986 were analyzed. One thousand six hundred four renal transplant recipients with hypertensive renal failure as the cause of end stage renal disease (cases) were compared with 4506 race-matched cadaveric kidney donors (controls). Log-linear models were used to assess the relationship between hypertensive renal failure and prevalence of each HLA phenotype. Bonferroni adjustments of P values were used to correct for multiple comparisons. Comparison of HLA frequencies between blacks and whites with hypertensive renal failure demonstrated that blacks had an increased frequency of HLA-DR3 beyond that normally known to exist between black and white populations. Black cases compared to black controls had an 8.6% increase in HLA-DR3 frequency contrasted with a 1.6% decrease in the frequency of this antigen between white cases and white controls. This absolute 10.2% difference between the races was significant (P = .02) because the control black and white populations had nearly identical frequencies for this antigen. White cases compared to white controls had lower HLA-A1 and B8 frequencies (21.2% v 30.6%, P = .0005 and 13.7% v 22.3%, P = .001, respectively) and a greater HLA-B35 frequency (20.7% v 14.2%, P = .02). \nLater recurrence and longer survival among obese patients with renal cell carcinoma. To investigate the effect of obesity at diagnosis on prognosis of renal cell carcinoma, 360 renal cell carcinoma patients newly diagnosed at 29 hospitals in Oklahoma between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 1984 were followed through December 31, 1987. The Cox proportional-hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio, adjusting for other potentially prognostic factors. Both the disease-free interval and the overall survival were longer in patients who were obese (greater than or equal to 120% standard body mass index) at diagnosis. The adjusted-hazard ratio for disease recurrence between obese and nonobese patients was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.98). The obese patients had an adjusted death hazard rate 0.68 times that of the nonobese patients (95% CI, 0.38 to 1.22). Although obesity was reported to increase the risk for renal cell carcinoma, prognosis was no worse and may be better among obese patients with the disease. \nNode negative breast cancer: the prognostic value of DNA ploidy for long-term survival. The DNA content of breast tumours from 170 patients who presented between 1978 and 1980 was measured by flow cytometry. The relationship between tumour ploidy and disease outcome was assessed and its association with other prognostic factors evaluated. Compared with those with diploid tumours, patients with aneuploid tumours had significantly earlier relapse and shorter survival (P less than 0.0001). Tumour ploidy was strongly related to grade (P less than 0.001), but there was no significant association between DNA ploidy and c-erb-B-2 expression, lymph node status or tumour size. In lymph node negative and c-erb-B-2 negative patients, aneuploid tumours were associated with a poorer prognosis (P less than 0.001) than diploid tumours. Multivariate analysis showed that tumour ploidy gave independent information on disease free and overall survival. Tumour ploidy may be used as an independent prognostic variable in patients with breast cancer and it may be helpful in defining patients within the node negative or c-erb-B-2 negative groups likely to have a poor outcome who might benefit from adjuvant treatment. \nEffect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. To determine whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may reduce the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we retrospectively identified 322 consecutive patients who underwent a successful procedure from June 1988 to December 1989. No patients developed chest pain, ST segment elevation, positive cardiac enzymes, or other evidence of abrupt vessel closure following the PTCA. All patients received intravenous heparin after PTCA and aspirin was begun on the day prior to PTCA. Patients were separated into two groups: those at hospital discharge incidentally treated for hypertension or heart failure with ACE inhibitors (n = 36), and those treated with a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors (n = 286). The two groups were similar with respect to age (61 +/- 13.5 vs. 60 +/- 12.5, p = NS) and other demographic characteristics. Restenosis, defined as the presentation to a physician with symptoms of angina within 6 months of the PTCA and the finding on repeat catheterization of a significant restenosis at the site of the PTCA, occurred in 30% of the patients who were discharged on a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors vs. 3% (p less than .05) in those treated with an ACE inhibitor. Thus, it appears that the use of ACE inhibitors may significantly reduce the incidence of restenosis after successful PTCA. \nHaemodynamic significance of incompetent calf perforating veins. A total of 149 consecutive unselected patients (221 limbs) who presented with signs and symptoms of chronic venous problems (varicose veins with or without ankle oedema, skin changes and leg ulcers) have been studied by clinical examination, ascending deep to superficial venography, Doppler ultrasound and ambulatory venous pressure measurements. Of the limbs, 180 (82 per cent) had varicose veins without obstruction in the deep veins or reflux in the popliteal or femoral veins while 41 (18 per cent) had deep venous disease. Of the 180 limbs with 'primary' varicose veins 110 (60 per cent) did not have incompetent calf perforating veins (group A) while 70 (40 per cent) did (group B). On the basis of the ambulatory venous pressure after calf muscle exercise and the refilling time, the incompetent calf perforating veins of limbs in group B belonged to three subgroups of different haemodynamic significance. In 20 limbs (30 per cent) they were found to be of no haemodynamic significance, in 25 (35 per cent) of moderate haemodynamic significance and in 25 (35 per cent) of major haemodynamic significance. The last were, on clinical examination, indistinguishable from limbs with deep venous disease although they had patent deep veins with competent popliteal valves. \nNeonatal short bowel syndrome. In this retrospective study the management of infants who had undergone resection of more than 50% of the small bowel as newborn infants between 1970 and 1988 was analyzed to define prognostic factors. Small bowel resections were performed for atresia (36 cases), volvulus (22 cases), gastroschisis (10 cases), necrotizing enterocolitis (11 cases), and other disorders (8 cases). Patients were classified into two groups depending on the length of residual small bowel: group 1 (n = 35) had less than 40 cm of small bowel and group 2 (n = 51) had 40 to 80 cm of residual small bowel. Patients in group 2 had significantly better survival rates than those in group 1 (92.0% vs 66.6%; p less than 0.001). The patients in group 1 who were born after 1980, when home parenteral nutrition was introduced, had better survival rates than those who were treated before 1980 (95.0% vs 65.0%; p less than 0.01). The time required for acquisition of intestinal adaptation depended on the intestinal length (average, 27.3 months for group 1 and 14 months for group 2; p less than 0.01) and on the presence or absence of the ileocecal valve. Parenteral or supportive enteral nutrition, or both, ensured normal growth in both groups. We conclude that more than 90% of infants now survive after extensive small bowel resection with parenteral nutrition and that the remaining small intestine will adapt with time. Home-based parenteral nutrition allowed children to be treated in the best psychosocial environment. \nNonpharmacological therapy of hypertension. Commentary on diet and blood pressure. The use of dietary measures as sole therapy for hypertension has generated much enthusiasm and is supported by epidemiological and anecdotal data but is not substantiated by long-term controlled trials. Dietary measures should be effective in preventing the rise in blood pressure with age in civilized populations, but there are no firm data to substantiate this hypothesis. However, some data do suggest that weight loss and sodium restriction may benefit the drug-treated hypertensive patient. There are strong reasons to consider the use of nonpharmacological measures for the treatment of mild hypertension. Mild hypertension is ubiquitous. Some population subsets have a prevalence of mild hypertension approaching 40%, based on one blood pressure determination, for individuals older than 50 years. Even if the true prevalence is closer to 15%, this is a high proportion of the population in need of drug therapy. If a change in lifestyle could reduce the need for drug therapy by a respectable percentage, then an enormous number of individuals could be spared the necessity of taking antihypertensive medication. \nInhibition of endogenous superoxide dismutase with diethyldithiocarbamate in acute island skin flaps. Oxygen free radicals have been implicated in postischemic tissue damage in a variety of experimental models including the island skin flap. Previous studies have demonstrated that supplementing animals with exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD), a free radical scavenger, improves tissue survival in island flaps. No studies to our knowledge have attempted to inhibit endogenous SOD in a skin flap model. In this experiment 20 control rats demonstrated a 12.00% flap necrosis 7 days after a modified ventral island skin flap was raised. A second group of 20 rats were supplemented with exogenous SOD (50,000 U/kg 30 minutes preoperatively and 12 hours postoperatively) and demonstrated a statistically significant decreased flap necrosis of 5.28%. A third group of 20 rats received diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC, 0.5 gm/kg 12 hours preoperatively), an agent previously shown to inhibit SOD, and demonstrated a statistically significant increased flap necrosis of 19.77%. In a final group of 20 rats the effect of DDC was overcome by supplementation with exogenous SOD, obtaining a flap necrosis of 8.35%. Our results add further support to the importance of SOD and oxygen free radicals in postischemic tissue damage by demonstrating increased tissue necrosis with inhibition of endogenous SOD. This suggests that there is a baseline degree of SOD activity in ischemic areas working to preserve tissue. It appears that the copper-containing species of SOD found primarily in the cytoplasm plays a pivotal role in preservation of postischemic tissue. \nAcute and chronic symptoms of mononucleosis. BACKGROUND. The clinical symptoms and durations of illness of patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM) are variable and are poorly documented in the scientific literature. METHODS. Patients who presented for care at the Student Health Service of a Canadian university between September 1985 and May 1988 and had been diagnosed as having IM were surveyed. Health experience during the acute and convalescent phases of IM was compared with that of a group of patients matched for age, sex, date of diagnosis, and year of study, who had suffered acute upper respiratory tract infections (URI), other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced, during the same period. RESULTS. Students were sicker for longer after IM than after non-EBV-induced URI. During the acute phase of illness, the symptoms of fatigue (P = less than .000001), night sweats (P = .000001), and painful neck swelling (P = .00003) were seen significantly more often in the IM group. The severity and duration of these symptoms were also significantly worse in IM patients. Getting tired easily (P = .002), diurnal somnolence (P = .002), and depression (P = .002) were significantly more common postacute symptoms. Eleven percent of IM patients reported persistence of symptoms longer than 100 days, and in 6% of patients the symptoms had persisted after 1 year. Convalescent cases showed a trend toward reduced alcohol intake and, perhaps, reduced alcohol tolerance. CONCLUSIONS. IM involves excessive morbidity in a student community compared with URI that was other than EBV-induced, during both the acute and the postacute phases of infection. \nAnalysis of septic morbidity following gunshot wounds to the colon: the missile is an adjuvant for abscess. Over a 7-year period, 151 patients with gunshot wounds to the colon surviving beyond 24 hours were managed. The bullet was retained in the body in 66% and exited in 34%. Thirty-four (23%) developed major septic complications (diffuse peritonitis, 21%; intraperitoneal abscesses 24%; and extraperitoneal abdominal abscesses, 56%). The septic complication rate was 26% in the bullet-present group compared with 16% in the remainder (p less than 0.15). The increased septic rate in those with bullets present was the result of abscesses developing around the retained missile. That group with missile abscesses had a lesser degree of injury as measured by the abdominal trauma index compared with the other patients with septic complications (p less than 0.001). Fifteen (79%) of the 19 patients with missile and missile track abscesses had them develop in the psoas muscle. These abscesses occur by fecal contamination of the muscle following inoculation by the bullet, which passes through the large bowel. Computed tomography-guided and operative drainage tend to fail if the foreign body is not removed. Computed tomography-guided or operative drainage should be successful in draining missile track abscesses when the bullet has exited the patient. \nMolecular characterization of a supratypic cross-reactive idiotype associated with IgM autoantibodies. Neoplastic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL) frequently express surface Ig reactive with the mouse mAb, Lc1. Raised against a human monoclonal IgM with rheumatoid factor activity, Lc1 detects a major cross-reactive Id (CRI) present on the H chain of many monoclonal IgM autoantibodies. In contrast to other major autoantibody-CRI investigated to date, we note that the Lc1-CRI is expressed by subpopulation of cells in the germinal centers, as well as in the mantle zones, of secondary human B cell follicles. To examine the molecular basis for Lc1 expression, we used the polymerase chain reaction to isolate the functionally rearranged Ig VH genes of monoclonal Lc1-reactive B cell populations from six unrelated patients with CLL or SLL. Although the neoplastic B cells from most patients with CLL or SLL express the CD5 surface differentiation Ag, the lymphoma cells from one patient with SLL were CD5-negative. We find that the Lc1-reactive cells from each cell population have Ig rearrangements involving a VH gene of the VH4 subgroup. However, the VH4 genes rearranged in different Lc1-reactive tumor populations may originate from at least two disparate germ-line VH4 genes. Also, in contrast to the CD5-positive tumor populations, we find evidence for intraclonal diversity in the functionally rearranged VH4 genes of the CD5-negative SLL. Collectively, this study discerns a degeneracy in the VH4 genes that can encode the Lc1 CRI, indicating the term \"supratypic cross-reactive idiotype\" may best describe the specificity of the Lc1 mAb. Also, this study suggests that expression of CD5 may delineate categories of B cell SLL that differ in their relative rates of constitutive Ig V gene somatic mutation. \nInvasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis in patients with acute leukemia. Invasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis is a potentially lethal complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with acute leukemia. The majority of cases are caused by Aspergillus flavus. The infection is difficult to diagnose early but should be suspected when a neutropenic patient develops persistent fever without a known source, symptoms of rhinitis or sinusitis, cutaneous findings over the nose or sinuses, symptoms and signs of orbital or cavernous sinus disease, or an ulcerating lesion of the hard palate or gingiva. Careful anterior rhinoscopy followed by computed tomography of the sinus helps establish the diagnosis, which should be confirmed by histologic study and culture of biopsied material. Early treatment with aggressive surgery, high-dose amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, and possibly white blood cell transfusions may produce a cure if the patient's bone marrow recovers. Newer antifungal agents offer promise for prophylaxis and treatment of this infection. \nHemodynamic monitoring: a technology assessment. Technology Subcommittee of the Working Group on Critical Care, Ontario Ministry of Health. OBJECTIVE: To review catheterization of the right side of the heart according to technical capability, diagnostic accuracy, range of possible uses, therapeutic impact, benefit to patient outcome and impact on health care workers. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE was searched for English-language articles published since 1962. Additional references were selected from the bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Nonrandomized trials and retrospective reviews were included because of a paucity of randomized controlled trials. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: After a review of the data on hemodynamic monitoring by the subcommittee members, guidelines were developed through the use of the nominal group and Delphi consensus-gathering techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The use of catheterization of the right side of the heart for hemodynamic monitoring should be reserved for tertiary and secondary care hospitals, which are adequately staffed by physicians and nurses well versed in the use of such monitoring. Future research should be directed at determining whether the use of hemodynamic monitoring will improve outcomes among patients, especially those with myocardial infarction, septic shock or pulmonary edema. \nCervical dystonia: clinical findings and associated movement disorders. We studied 300 patients, 61% women, with mean age 49.7 years and mean duration of dystonia 7.8 years, to determine the demographic and clinical characteristics of cervical dystonia (CD) and its relationships to other movement disorders. Torticollis was present in 82%, laterocollis in 42%, retrocollis in 29%, and anterocollis in 25%; however, the majority (66%) had a combination of these abnormal postures. Scoliosis was present in 39%, local pain reported by 68%, and 32% had evidence of secondary cervical radiculopathy. In addition to CD, 16% of patients had oral dystonia, 12% mandibular dystonia, 10% hand/arm dystonia, and 10% had blepharospasm. Tremor was noted in 71% of patients; head-neck tremor was present in 60%, and tremor in other body regions was present in 32%. A family history of a movement disorder was present in 44% of the CD patients. Tardive dystonia was the cause in 6%; 11% had posttraumatic dystonia. Anticholinergic drugs provided moderate improvement in 33% of patients, but local intramuscular botulinum toxin injections relieved CD, local pain, or both in over 90% of all treated patients. \nNa(+)-H+ exchanger and its role in essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The Na(+)-H+ exchanger is a ubiquitous transport system that is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH, cell growth and proliferation, cell volume regulation, and transepithelial absorption of Na+, Cl-, and HCO3-. Altered activity of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger has been implicated as a mechanism contributing to the development of high blood pressure in subgroups of patients with essential hypertension and in various animal models of hypertension. Many of these studies measured Na(+)-Li+ exchange rather than Na(+)-H+ exchange, hypothesizing that Na(+)-Li+ exchange represents a functional mode of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger. However, this is a controversial assumption. Several studies have also shown an association between erythrocyte Na(+)-Li(+)-exchange rate and predisposition to nephropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The recent cDNA cloning of at least one isoform of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger will help clarify the cellular mechanisms of regulation of the exchanger and its possible role in pathophysiological states such as hypertension. \nGlobal T wave inversion. Because global T wave inversion has not been specifically characterized, 100 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with this pattern (frontal plane T vector -100 degrees to -170 degrees with precordial T inversion) were prospectively collected from approximately 30,000 consecutively interpreted ECGs and analyzed blindly. There was a striking female predominance (82 women vs. 18 men; p less than 0.0005) despite an essentially equal number of female and male hospital admissions. There was a single statistically significant ECG correlate: a more vertical QRS axis in women (+14.1 degrees +/- 45.3 degrees vs. -5.6 degrees +/- 31.3 degrees; p = 0.034). The T waves were basically symmetric (68%), the influence of this factor usually altering the characteristically asymmetric T wave inversions of right bundle branch block (4 of 5) and left ventricular hypertrophy (21 of 36). Asymmetry was mainly associated with digoxin therapy (21 of 32 patients taking digoxin; p less than or equal to 0.0005) and a corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.433 +/- 0.095) shorter than with symmetric T wave inversions (0.507 +/- 0.074; p less than or equal to 0.0005) though not reaching the degree of shortening expected for digitalization. Twenty-eight patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and 23 for a central nervous system disorder accounted for the majority of patients with symmetric T wave inversion. Fifteen of 18 patients who had coronary angiography had some degree of coronary artery disease: 3 had angiographically normal coronary arteries. \nEnteropathogens associated with acute diarrheal disease in urban infants in Sao Paulo, Brazil. To determine the prevalence and epidemiology of enteropathogens in acute infantile diarrhea, 500 infants less than or equal to 12 months of age with diarrhea and 500 age-matched control subjects coming to a Sao Paulo emergency room were studied. Enteropathogens were identified in 55% of case infants and 10% of controls; enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) of classic EPEC serotypes producing EPEC adherence factor (EAF) (26% of case infants), rotavirus (14%), Salmonella species (8%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (7%), and Shigella species (5%) were associated with diarrhea. Isolation of EAF+ classic EPEC decreased with increasing age of cases and peaked in spring, whereas rotavirus was least common in early infancy and peaked in fall and winter. Bloody stool had a 36% positive predictive value for Shigella infection, EAF+ classic EPEC were highly resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Among poor Sao Paulo infants, EAF+ classic EPEC equaled or exceeded rotavirus throughout the year as a cause of diarrhea bringing children to medical attention. \nGastritis due to spiral shaped bacteria other than Helicobacter pylori: clinical, histological, and ultrastructural findings. An intensive histological search for Helicobacter pylori in gastric biopsy specimens has led to the detection of other spiral shaped bacteria in the human gastric mucosa. The clinical and morphological findings of 39 cases (0.25% of all gastric biopsies performed in the observation period) are reported for 34 patients (87.2%) complaining of upper abdominal discomfort. Five patients (12.8%) had chronic gastritis and 34 (87.2%) chronic active gastritis. The organisms were seen by light microscopy deep in the gastric foveolae and intracellularly. The scanning and transmission electron microscopic findings show bacteria which invade and damage gastric mucosal cells. These organisms are similar to the spiral shaped bacteria found in the stomachs of cats and dogs and non-human primates. In eight patients organisms were not detected after four weeks of treatment with bismuth salts. The disappearance of the organisms coincided with resolution of the chronic active gastritis and the symptoms. \nJ. Maxwell Chamberlain Memorial Paper. Role of staging in prognosis and management of thymoma. Eighty-five patients operated on for thymoma from 1972 to 1989 were evaluated, 32 with myasthenia gravis and 53 without. Masaoka staging revealed stage I disease in 45 (53%), stage II in 23 (27%), stage III in 14 (16%), and stage IVa in 3 (4%). There was no operative mortality. Actuarial survival at 10 years was 63.7% for all patients: 78.3% for those in stage I, 74.7% for those in stage II, and 20.8% for those in stage III. There was no recurrence in patients in stage I. Mediastinal recurrence developed in 4 patients in stage II considered to have noninvasive disease by the surgeon. It is recommended that all patients be followed up for a minimum of 10 years and that all patients in stages II and III receive postoperative radiotherapy. The presence of myasthenia gravis is no longer considered as an adverse factor in survival. \nParticle shedding and migration from silicone genitourinary prosthetic devices. Of 26 patients undergoing revision of genitourinary prostheses the surrounding reactive fibrous capsule was biopsied in 25 and the draining lymph nodes also were biopsied in 4. The prostheses included 16 inflatable and 14 flexible penile devices, and 10 artificial urinary sphincters. Tissue was examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. X-ray microanalysis was done on intracellular and extracellular foreign material from each specimen. Silicone was found in 18 of the 25 periprosthetic specimens and in all 4 lymph nodes. Foreign body granulomas were identified in 14 of these 29 specimens. Examination of new and explanted versions of each prosthesis by scanning electron microscopy revealed free particles of silicone or silicates on the surface of most devices. Pitting and microfissuring were seen on a few of the new devices and on nearly all of the used ones. Thus, genitourinary prostheses shed silicone particles that can be found in the fibrous capsule and draining lymph nodes. \nHyperglycemia and neurological outcome in patients with head injury. To examine the relationship between serum glucose and the outcome of patients suffering from head injury, the authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 169 patients admitted for treatment to Harborview Medical Center (a regional trauma center). All patients underwent craniotomy for evacuation of intracranial hematoma and/or placement of a subarachnoid bolt for intracranial pressure monitoring under general anesthesia. Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less had significantly higher serum glucose levels than patients with GCS scores of 12 to 15 (mean +/- standard error of the mean 192 +/- 7 mg/dl vs. 130 +/- 8 mg/dl or 10.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter vs. 7.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter) (p less than 0.0001). Patients who subsequently remained in a vegetative state or died had significantly higher glucose levels both on admission and postoperatively than patients who had good outcome or moderate disability (217 +/- 12 mg/dl vs. 167 +/- 6 mg/dl or 12.1 +/- 0.7 mmol/liter vs. 9.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter on admission, and 240 +/- 16 mg/dl vs. 156 +/- 5 mg/dl or 13.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/liter vs. 8.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter postoperatively) (p less than 0.0001). Among the more severely injured patients (GCS score less than or equal to 8), a serum glucose level greater than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/liter) postoperatively is associated with a significantly worse outcome (p less than 0.01). The authors conclude that severely head-injured patients frequently develop hyperglycemia and the elevated serum glucose level may aggravate ischemic insults and worsen the neurological outcome in such patients. \nLobular carcinoma in situ of the breast: clinical, pathologic, and mammographic features. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) was diagnosed in 165 surgical specimens (119 patients) at our institution between 1974 and 1987. LCIS was seen more often in younger women (mean age, 49 years) than other breast carcinomas were (mean age, 58 years). Sampling of a single breast revealed multifocal disease in 70% (96/138). When both breasts were sampled, bilateral foci were found in 50% (41/82). Of 165 breasts with foci of LCIS, 37% (61/165) had simultaneously occurring invasive cancers in the same breast. Direct mammographic-pathologic correlation of foci of LCIS was possible in 73 breasts (67 patients). Microcalcifications were an indication for biopsy in 49% (20/41) of breasts with a mammographic abnormality, but were a nonspecific finding often found in tissues adjacent to foci of LCIS. The mammogram was normal in 44% (32/73) of breasts with foci of LCIS. The mammograms of patients with LCIS and those from a group of age-matched control subjects were compared by using a modified form of Wolfe's criteria and the percentage of fibroglandular elements. LCIS was seldom found in an N1 breast (1% vs 29%) or in a breast with less than 25% of its parenchymal area occupied by fibroglandular density (3% vs 33%). Compared with the control group, breasts with LCIS had more than 50% fibroglandular density (85% vs 45%) and a much higher frequency of the DY pattern (56% vs 36%). More fibroglandular density was seen in the LCIS group at all ages. Postmenopausally, the frequencies of the DY pattern and fibroglandular density greater than 50% in LCIS patients were nearly double those in the control group. LCIS patients have disease of the entire breast parenchyma, characterized by multifocality and bilaterality of various forms of lobular disease. Their mammograms reveal a higher rate of the DY pattern and higher percentages of fibroglandular or parenchymal density than those of age-matched controls. In LCIS patients, persistence of the DY pattern, or large amounts of fibroglandular density postmenopausally supports the concept that mammographically dense breasts are a marker for increased cancer risk in women 50 years old and older. \nSelective 2-[18F]fluorodopa uptake for melanogenesis in murine metastatic melanomas. The relationship between 3,4-dihydroxy-2-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine (2-[18F]FDOPA) uptake and melanogenesis was studied using mice bearing two B16 melanomas: B16-F1 has a higher melanin synthesis ability and a slower growing rate than the higher metastatic B16-F10. A significantly higher 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake by B16-F1 than by B16-F10 and a reverse relationship for the uptake of [14C] 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose and [3H]thymidine were observed 1 hr postinjection. F1-to-F10 ratios of both the 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake and the acid-insoluble radioactivity increased to about 5 at 6 hr, which paralleled the melanin content. FM3A mammary carcinoma showed a 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake similar to the B16-F10 but without the acid-insoluble radioactivity. With D,L-DOPA loading, a 55% decreased uptake by FM3A 1 hr postinjection was significantly greater than the 20% reduction in both melanomas. O-Methylated 2-[18F]FDOPA was a predominant acid-soluble metabolite in all tumors. Whole-body autoradiography discriminated the two melanomas clearly. 2-[18F]FDOPA may be a promising tracer for the selective imaging of melanogenesis. \nUse of percutaneous nephrostomy in malignant ureteric obstruction. Seventeen patients with malignant disease underwent percutaneous nephrostomy to relieve renal failure secondary to ureteric obstruction. Renal function improved in 88%. The median survival time was 18 weeks and 58% left the primary hospital to return home or to a terminal care hospice. Minor complications occurred in 58%. The use of bilateral nephrostomy tubes conferred no greater benefit than a unilateral tube. Intervention in malignant ureteric obstruction may confer some benefit and should not necessarily be viewed with pessimism. \nInhibition of burn pain by intravenous lignocaine infusion. Patients with burns often suffer severe pain, especially during dressing of wounds, but there are no established alternatives to potent opiate analgesics, with their various side-effects. Intravenous lignocaine infusion strikingly reduced self-assessed pain scores in 7 patients during the first 3 days after second-degree burns, without need for supplementary opiate analgesia. \nAcetylcholine receptor-reactive T and B cells in myasthenia gravis and controls. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is strongly associated with antibodies to acetylcholine receptor (AChR), whereas the extent of T cell involvement is not settled. The number of cells secreting interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to AChR during 48 h culture of blood mononuclear cells (PBL) may reflect AChR-reactive T cells. Using an immunospot assay, we detected such cells in 23 of 30 patients with MG at a mean number of 1 per 33.333 PBL. AChR-reactive T cells were also found in patients with other neurological diseases (OND) and in healthy subjects but at lower frequencies and numbers. The T cell response to purified protein derivative and to PHA, and also to two major myelin proteins (basic protein and proteolipid protein) did not differ between MG and the two control groups, underlining the specificity of an augmented T cell reactivity to AChR in MG. Evaluation of the B cell response by enumerating anti-AChR IgG antibody secreting cells revealed such cells in 27 of 28 patients with MG at a mean value of 1 per 14,085 PBL. Cells secreting anti-AChR antibodies of the IgA and IgM isotypes were also detected in MG, but less frequently, at lower numbers, and only in conjunction with IgG antibody secreting cells. Anti-AChR antibody secreting cells were also found among patient with OND and in healthy controls, but at lower frequencies and numbers. These data confirm that AChR is a major target for autoimmune response in MG. \nEffects of high-dose aprotinin on blood loss, platelet function, fibrinolysis, complement, and renal function after cardiopulmonary bypass. The use of aprotinin to reduce blood loss after cardiopulmonary bypass is under debate. Concern has been raised about the renal effects of aprotinin. We administered a mean aprotinin dose of 4.2 x 10(6) kallikrein-inhibiting units to 13 patients with coronary disease undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for 74 +/- 5 minutes (mean +/- standard error of the mean); 13 comparable patients having cardiopulmonary bypass served as control subjects, and all were studied postoperatively for 24 hours. Aprotinin reduced postoperative blood loss by 50% (p = 0.0082). Two of the 13 patients who received aprotinin needed one red cell unit each versus a total of 18 units in eight of 13 control patients (p = 0.0096). Blood pressure, hemoglobin value and serum protein concentration were higher after operation in the aprotinin group (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01). Platelet counts did not differ, but plasma thromboxane was lower in aprotinin recipients (p less than 0.001). In control patients fibrinogen degradation products (D dimer) doubled, and alpha 2-antiplasmin activity was halved during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.01 to p less than 0.001), whereas aprotinin patients showed no changes. The complement breakdown products C4a, C3a, and C3dg as well as C9 neoantigen increased from prebypass baseline in both groups (p less than 0.001); the increment of C3a and C3dg was greater in the aprotinin than in the control patients (p less than 0.001). Serum electrolytes, osmolality, and creatinine remained normal in both groups of patients. Creatinine clearance was normal or above normal and virtually identical in both groups. Osmolar clearance and fractional sodium excretion were higher in the aprotinin group than in the control group shortly after cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01); renal function was unremarkable the next morning. No adverse clinical effects attributable to aprotinin were seen. In summary, aprotinin offers advantages for cardiopulmonary bypass. \nResection of a granular cell tumor at the hepatic confluence. A precarious location for a benign tumor. Granular cell tumors are lesions that account for less than 10 per cent of benign biliary tumors and only 1 per cent occur in the biliary tract. Since the first description, 45 other cases have been described to which we add a case. In reviewing the literature, a striking predominance in black females is evident. The most frequent location of these tumors in the biliary tree appears to be the common bile duct (50%), followed by the cystic duct (37%), the hepatic ducts (15%), and the gallbladder (4%). Most patients have been treated with resection followed by restoration of biliary continuity using biliary enteric diversion. In the case presented, the tumor was located at the hepatic confluence with extension into the hepatic substance requiring segmental duct cholangiojejunostomy after resection. This resulted in fulminant sepsis and death despite adequate preoperative biliary decompression and the lack of signs or symptoms of infected bile. Alternative forms of management in the treatment of this benign condition at this location are discussed. \nNaevocytic naevi with vascular-like spaces. Fourteen cases of naevocytic naevi with anastomising lacunae suggestive of vascular spaces are reported. The cells lining these lacunae were consistent with naevus cells, being positive for vimentin and S100 protein and negative for factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus I. The cells were not surrounded by laminin or type IV collagen. We suggest the formation of these vascular-like spaces may be due to defective production or increased degradation of components of the basement membrane with a consequent lack of cohesion. \nSomatosensory evoked potentials in intracranial hypertension: analysis of the effects of hypoxia. The loss of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP's) was investigated in a feline model of intracranial hypertension. Threshold values of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) required for maintenance of SSEP's are defined using a mathematical model. The model describes loss of amplitude of SSEP's using the form of a dose-response curve. Amplitude of the SSEP's declined to 50% of control values at a CBF of 15 ml/100 gm/min and a CPP of 20 mm Hg in the normoxic animal; in the presence of mild hypoxia (8 to 9 kPa), a significant increase in these values to 18 ml/100 gm/min and 32 mm Hg, respectively, occurred. No reliable changes in latency or central conduction time were demonstrated. It is concluded that given adequate oxygenation, evoked electrical activity is lost at too low a level of CPP for this parameter to be useful in clinical monitoring. However, even mild hypoxia, when combined with intracranial hypertension, produces a major risk to neuronal integrity. \nThe effect of ethanol on the uptake, binding, and desialylation of transferrin by rat liver endothelium: implications in the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated hepatic siderosis. Chronic alcoholism has been reported to be associated with a reduced carbohydrate content of transferrin (TF), particularly, its reduced sialylation state. Low sialylation state of TF now serves as an objective marker of chronic alcohol abuse. To investigate the pathophysiological significance of this finding in relation to hepatic siderosis, also commonly associated with chronic alcoholism, the authors have investigated the effect of ethanol on the uptake, binding, and desialylation of transferrin by isolated rat liver endothelium in vitro. In pulse-chase experiments, transferrin labeled with either 125I (protein-labeled) or 3H (sialic acid-labeled) was incubated with isolated, fractionated liver endothelium with and without ethanol, and the supernates were subjected to column chromatography using RCA120- agarose. Incubation of the endothelium with increasing concentrations of ethanol resulted in a progressive increase in the desialylation rate of transferrin which was maximal when 160 mM concentration of ethanol was used. These data indicate that ethanol significantly promotes the desialylation of transferrin by rat liver endothelium. The implications of these findings in the pathogenesis of hepatic siderosis of the alcoholic are discussed. \nCauses of blindness and visual handicap in the Central African Republic. The causes of bilateral blindness (best visual acuity less than 3/60) in 1371 people in the Central African Republic seen between 1985 and 1989 who attended eye clinics in 10 out of the 16 prefectures across the country are given. The main causes of bilateral blindness were cataract (51%), glaucoma (12.7%), and onchocerciasis (8.1%). In 710 patients with unilateral blindness the main causes were cataract (38%), glaucoma (10%), iritis (7.5%), and trauma (6.3%). Bilateral blindness in children was rarely seen. The causes of visual impairment (vision between 6/18 and 3/60) in 424 patients were cataract, including aphakia (38%), maculopathy (14%), and onchocerciasis (7%). \nEndothelial cell damage by Walker carcinosarcoma cells is dependent on vitronectin receptor-mediated tumor cell adhesion. The transport of cancer cells from blood vessels to extravascular tissue is a critical step in metastasis, where endothelial cells and the vascular basement membrane act as barriers to cell traffic. Because endothelial injury can facilitate the metastasis of intravascular cancer cells in vivo, the authors have studied in vitro the free-radical-mediated endothelial damage caused by the rat Walker 256 carcinosarcoma (W256) cell after stimulation with 10(-6) mol/l (molar) phorbol ester. Here the authors have examined the hypothesis that W256 cell-mediated endothelial injury is dependent on adhesion between the effector and target cells. Attachment of phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated W256 cells to endothelial monolayers was increased 1.8 +/- 0.1-fold and damage (3H-2-deoxyglucose release from labeled endothelium) 1.4 +/- 0.1-fold after 4-hour pretreatment of the endothelium with 10 ng/ml recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha). Under various assay conditions, the release of 3H-2-deoxyglucose correlated directly with tumor cell adhesion (r = 0.98, P less than 0.005). In the presence of a polyclonal anti-vitronectin receptor antiserum, adhesion of stimulated W256 cells to rIL-1 alpha-treated monolayers was inhibited by 39% +/- 2%, and 3H-2-deoxyglucose release was inhibited by 53% +/- 13%. Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence flow cytometry demonstrated that the endothelial cells but not the W256 cells expressed vitronectin receptor (VnR) on their cell surface. The surface expression of VnR by endothelial cells was increased 1.9 +/- 0.1-fold after 4 hours' incubation with rIL-1 alpha. The authors conclude that W256 cell-mediated endothelial damage is dependent on cell adhesion, which, in turn, is partly regulated by the expression of VnR on the endothelial cell surface. \nProspective neuropathological validation of Hachinski's Ischaemic Score in dementias. The sensitivity and specificity of Hachinski's Ischaemic Score (IS) in the diagnosis of the vascular aetiology of dementia was studied in a series of 32 demented patients, dementia of the Alzheimer type (16), multi-infarct dementia (7), mixed dementia (6), Pick's disease (3), with neuropathological diagnosis as the point of reference. The IS distinguished between primary degenerative dementia and multi-infarct or mixed dementia. As single features of the IS \"a positive history of stroke\" and \"a fluctuating course\" showed differing prevalences in the latter two diagnostic categories. The IS labelled 21% of patients with primary degenerative dementia as having a vascular aetiology. The uncritical application of the IS to large samples in epidemiological studies may cause incorrect labelling of a significant proportion of patients with primary degenerative dementia as vascular dementia. These results are based on observations of long-term inpatients and depend on neuropathological criteria. While the definite diagnosis of DAT by threshold criteria concerning plaque and tangle counts is well established, neither clinical nor pathological evidence of stroke necessarily means that cerebrovascular disease has anything to do with a patient's dementia. \nShunt failure caused by valve collapse. Shunt failure due to collapse of the Mini-Holter valve was observed 13 times in 11 out of 179 children with an implanted Mini-Holter ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) or ventriculo-atrial (VA) shunt during a 10 year period. Intussusception of the proximal or distal end of the valve thus caused a shunt failure rate of 6% of the children in this series. Two children experienced this complication twice. All collapsed valves were part of a VP shunt system. Because of this experience use of the mini valve was abandoned and an adult Holter valve was implanted in children over the age of one month. Breakdown of this particular valve has not occurred in 102 children and two hundred adults with the adult Holter shunt system. \nAdrenergic receptor responsiveness and congestive heart failure. Our knowledge and understanding of the structure, mechanism of action and regulation of receptor-adenylate cyclase systems have increased dramatically in the last few years. A family of receptors (including the beta-adrenergic receptors) and guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G proteins) have been purified and cloned. Structure-function studies are beginning to provide insight into how the various components of the transmembrane signaling apparatus interact to promote alterations in the activity of the effector systems. Much effort has been devoted to understanding how various pathophysiologic conditions, such as ischemia or congestive heart failure, and the therapeutic methods used to treat such conditions perturb or regulate receptor systems. It has become abundantly clear that such regulation does occur but is not restricted to simple alterations in receptor number, and may well involve covalent modification (phosphorylation) of receptors or alteration in the ability of receptors to interact with G proteins. In addition, regulation of the quantity or functionality of the various G proteins and the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase itself appear to occur. For example, recent evidence suggests that congestive heart failure in humans is associated with a decreased number of beta-adrenergic receptors as well as an increased quantity of the inhibitory G protein (Gi). These alterations may provide important insight into how to develop new therapeutic methods. Mechanisms generally responsible for transmembrane signaling, how the components are regulated by pathophysiologic conditions, and drugs used to treat disease states are discussed in detail. \nHuman recombinant DNA-derived antihemophilic factor (factor VIII) in the treatment of hemophilia A. recombinant Factor VIII Study Group BACKGROUND. Current treatment of hemophilia A, a hereditary disorder affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 males, relies on plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates. We tested the safety and efficacy of a recombinant factor VIII preparation for the treatment of this disorder. METHODS. We conducted the investigation in three stages: comparing the pharmacokinetics of plasma-derived and recombinant factor VIII, assessing the efficacy of recombinant factor VIII for home therapy, and assessing its efficacy for major surgical procedures and hemorrhage. A total of 107 subjects with hemophilia, 20 of whom had not been treated previously, enrolled in the investigation. RESULTS. The in vivo recovery and elimination half-lives of recombinant factor VIII equaled or exceeded those of plasma-derived factor VIII. Seventy-six subjects participated in a home-treatment program, using recombinant factor VIII for 69 to 807 days (median, 618); home diaries of 56 subjects treated for 5 months were analyzed. Of 540 bleeding episodes, 399 (73.9 percent) required only one treatment with recombinant factor VIII. The projected annual consumption of recombinant factor VIII was similar to that of plasma-derived factor VIII concentrate. Twenty-six subjects received recombinant factor VIII for 22 surgical procedures and 10 serious hemorrhages; hemostasis was excellent in all cases. De novo formation of inhibitors occurred in only 1 of 85 previously treated subjects. Inhibitor antibodies also developed in 6 of 21 children, 20 of whom had not previously been treated; 5 had low levels (less than or equal to 7.5 Bethesda units) despite continued treatment with recombinant factor VIII. There was no evidence of new formation of antibody to foreign proteins, and recombinant factor VIII was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS. Recombinant factor VIII has biologic activity comparable to that of plasma factor VIII and is safe and efficacious for the treatment of hemophilia A. \nThe time course and magnitude of spontaneous recovery of parkinsonism produced by intracarotid administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine to monkeys. We studied rhesus monkeys with hemiparkinsonism or bilateral parkinsonism produced by unilateral or bilateral intracarotid administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Using a standardized clinical rating scale, 4 hemiparkinsonian monkeys showed a 13 to 56% (mean, 36%) spontaneous improvement during an observation period of up to 25 weeks. Generally, recovery leveled off after 14 weeks. Four bilaterally parkinsonian monkeys showed a 5 to 42% (mean, 22%) improvement over a period of up to 30 weeks. Our findings emphasize that spontaneous recovery is a potentially confounding characteristic of this monkey model when used for assessing novel antiparkinsonian therapies. \nThe value of MCA, CA 15-3, CEA and CA-125 for discrimination between metastatic breast cancer and adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. MCA, CA 15-3, CEA and CA 125 were determined in the serum of 49 patients with metastatic breast cancer and 38 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. By using the 99th percentile of the normal value distribution as the cut-off point, the positive predictive value (PV+) was found to be 85% (95% CI 76-94) for MCA, and 71% (95% CI 61-81) for CA 15-3. When receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, the PV+ for CA 15-3 was increased to 82% (95% CI 72-92), using 60 U ml-1 as the cut-off point. With the exception of two patients who had a slightly elevated MCA, MCA and CA 15-3 identified the same patients with breast cancer. By combining a positive MCA or CA 15-3 with a negative CEA and CA 125, further improvement of the PV+ could be achieved; 100% (95% CI 91-100). We conclude that MCA and CA 15-3 may play a useful role in discrimination between patients with metastatic breast cancer and those with adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. \nA comparison of the caffeine halothane muscle contracture test with the molecular genetic diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is currently diagnosed by the caffeine-halothane contracture (CHC) test. In a previous study, this test was used to establish linkage between the human gene for MH susceptibility and the ryanodine receptor (RYR) gene. The current study extends the genetic linkage analysis to a large French-Canadian kindred. In this family, genetic linkage between RYR and MH genes was not demonstrable using the currently recommended limits of normal for the CHC test in the identification of MH-susceptible individuals. With CHC test threshold limits below those currently recommended, however, complete linkage between the RYR and MH genes was seen. Comparisons of CHC test results with genetic linkage studies will increase the diagnostic accuracy of both tests as well as generate new insights into the biology of MH. \nRisk factors and the natural history of coronary heart disease in blacks. Contrary to early impressions of blacks' relative immunity to CHD, it is now clear that African Americans experience greater mortality from CHD than whites. The natural history of CHD differs between blacks and whites in three important respects: First, greater prevalence of established risk factors among blacks suggests that they may be at greater risk for heart disease than their white counterparts. Second, health care seeking differences are evident between blacks and whites, leading to lower rates of identification of early disease and slower seeking of services for acute events. However, risk factor differences and health care seeking behaviors do not appear to account for all of the differences in the natural history of heart disease between the ethnic groups, such as survival rate differences during treatment. Economic factors appear to account for only a portion of these differences in risk factors and health care seeking. Beyond differences in risk factors and health care seeking, other, as yet undetermined, factors seem to be involved. These unknown influences could include physiologic, behavioral, and/or psychologic differences. \nTotal hip replacement for juvenile chronic arthritis. We review the results of 96 primary total hip replacements in 54 patients with juvenile chronic arthritis at five years or longer after surgery. The mean age at operation was 16.7 years (range 11.25 to 26.6); the follow-up period averaged 11.5 years. The clinical results in terms of pain, range of movement, mobility and function are presented. A revision procedure was required in 24 hips (25%) in 18 patients at an average of 9.5 years after the primary operation. A further 17 hips had radiographic signs of loosening. The factors thought to contribute to this relatively high failure rate in patients with juvenile chronic arthritis are discussed. \nCough-variant asthma in children and adults: case reports and review. Two cases of cough-variant asthma are presented, one in an adult and one in a child. We discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and course of this common, yet often unrecognized entity. The keys to diagnosis are a typical history, clinical suspicion, and subsequent response to bronchodilator therapy. Treatment of cough-variant asthma is no different from that of classic asthma. \nIntentional and unintentional ureteral surgical treatment in gynecologic procedures. During a period of slightly over nine years, 4,195 extensive gynecologic procedures were performed and 40 patients required ureteral operations, with the ureteral injury unintentional in 16 patients. Extensive complications occurred in seven of 40 patients; in two of three patients in whom the injury was recognized postoperatively, nephrectomy was required. Roentgenographic imaging of the genitourinary tract prior to operation did not prevent injury nor did attempts at identification of the ureter. The majority of ureteral repairs were accomplished by ureteroneocystotomy. In selected patients, placement of percutaneous or indwelling ureteral stent prevented extensive surgical intervention. \nLocalization and in vitro actions of atrial natriuretic peptide in the cat carotid body. Previous studies of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) have indicated that its release from the heart and from discrete areas of the central nervous system evokes coordinated physiological and behavioral adjustments that mitigate the adverse hypertensive effects of volume overload and/or acute increases in sodium intake. Because the reflex activity initiated by arterial chemoreceptors of the carotid body directly contributes to the integrated regulation of systemic blood pressure, we have investigated the possibility that ANP has a significant role in the chemosensory process as well. Our immunocytochemical studies show that ANP-like immunoreactivity is present in the preneural chemosensitive type I cells in the cat carotid body. Furthermore we found that the biologically active ANP fragment atriopeptin III is a potent inhibitor of carotid sinus nerve activity evoked by hypoxia. Our findings suggest that circulating and/or endogenous ANP may modulate carotid body function as part of a coordinated response to changes in systemic volume and solute balance. \nAn apparent cluster of congenital hypopituitarism in central Massachusetts: magnetic resonance imaging and hormonal studies. Between 1980 and 1989, five infants (four males and one female) with congenital hypopituitarism were born within a relatively sparsely populated area of central Massachusetts, an incidence 25-fold greater than expected. In all infants the pituitary stalk was undetectable on magnetic resonance imaging, and a bright spot on T-1 weighted imaging, probably representing posterior pituitary tissue, was found ectopically located inferior to the median eminence. The height of the anterior pituitary remnant on magnetic resonance imaging varied from undetectable to 4 mm, and similarly, on hormonal testing a spectrum of deficiencies of GH, TSH, ACTH, and gonadotropin was observed. The magnitude of the hypopituitarism was less in the three patients whose anterior pituitary remnant was greater than 2 mm, and in them, TRH testing resulted in exaggerated TSH and PRL responses, suggestive of hypothalamic disease. In contrast, in the other two patients in whom the anterior pituitary remnant was less than 2 mm in height, hypopituitarism was more severe, and TRH administration resulted in little if any TSH or PRL response, characteristic of pituitary disease. The size of the anterior pituitary remnant correlated significantly with that of the ectopic posterior pituitary bright spot (P less than 0.005). We conclude that patients with congenital hypopituitarism may exhibit a spectrum of hormonal responses, varying from findings typical of hypothalamic to those characteristic of primary pituitary disease. The pattern of hormonal responsiveness is dependent on the quantity of residual anterior pituitary tissue and probably results from abnormal transport of the hypothalamic hypophyseal releasing hormones rather than to any putative hypothalamic abnormality. The significant correlation between the size and function of the anterior pituitary gland and the size of the ectopic posterior pituitary remnant suggests that the fetal pituitary gland may secrete a factor necessary for the growth and descent of the neuroepithelium to form the infundibulum and posterior pituitary gland. \nDyslipidemic effects of cigarette smoking on beta-blocker-induced serum lipid changes in systemic hypertension. To assess the effects of beta blockers on lipids and apolipoproteins in cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, 330 patients with systemic hypertension received 1 month of placebo and 6 months of beta-blocker monotherapy. Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A1 and B were measured. Total cholesterol increased with propranolol (smokers vs nonsmokers, 8 vs 2%); increased for smokers and decreased for nonsmokers with atenolol (8 vs -3%), metoprolol (6 vs -1%) and pindolol (7 vs -6%); and decreased for both groups with celiprolol (-3 vs -10%). HDL cholesterol decreased with propranolol (smokers vs nonsmokers, -8 vs -18%), atenolol (-7 vs -2%) and metoprolol (-12 vs -1%); increased for smokers and decreased for nonsmokers with pindolol (11 vs -2%); and increased for both groups with celiprolol (5 vs 6%). Similar trends were observed with LDL cholesterol and the total/HDL cholesterol ratio. It is concluded that early noncardioselective beta blockers such as propranolol have significant dyslipidemic effects in both smokers and nonsmokers. Cardioselective drugs such as atenolol and metoprolol, or drugs with partial agonist activity such as pindolol, have variable effects. Celiprolol, a new, highly cardioselective beta 1 blocker with partial beta 2 agonist activity and vasodilatory properties, has favorable effects on lipids and minimizes the dyslipidemic effects associated with smoking. \nA combined approach for purging multidrug-resistant leukemic cell lines in bone marrow using a monoclonal antibody and chemotherapy. Selective removal of malignant cells (purging) from bone marrow (BM) is a concern in autologous BM transplantation (ABMT). Use of vincristine, etoposide, or doxorubicin for purging could be rendered ineffective by the presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells. To circumvent this particular problem, we investigated whether 17F9, a monoclonal IgG2b antibody directed against the cell surface product of the MDR gene, P-glycoprotein, is effective in selective removal of MDR cells from BM when used with rabbit complement (C'). Using two different cell lines we have demonstrated that 17F9 + C' selectively lyses MDR-positive cells. Three rounds of antibody + C' resulted in 96.4% +/- 3.6% kill of K562/DOX and 100% +/- 0% of CEM/VLB cells. Mixtures of malignant cells and normal BM resulted in 99.85% removal of K562/DOX and 99.91% removal of CEM/VLB clonogenic cells. This treatment did not affect normal committed precursors compared with C' alone. The addition of the cytotoxic agent etoposide (VP-16) following antibody purging results in a 4.6 log reduction of malignant cells. Furthermore, this antibody was effective when used against patients' leukemic blasts. These results suggest the use of 17F9 + C' is effective and selective for removal of MDR cells from BM before ABMT and the addition of VP-16 enhances the purging efficacy. \nMortality among petrochemical science and engineering employees. This is a study of a dynamic cohort of 13 250 commercial research and development personnel for whom information on occupational and educational background and smoking was available. Their age-, sex-, race-, and period-adjusted death rates were compared with New Jersey rates and with an internal comparison population. The overall results were favorable. The study groups had significantly fewer deaths from most major disease categories compared with other New Jersey residents. Among white male scientists and engineers, age-adjusted overall mortality and ischemic heart disease mortality were comparable to white male managers and support staff studied, whereas mortality from leukemia and lymphatic cancer was significantly elevated. Mechanics, however, had a significantly lower leukemia and lymphatic cancer mortality rate than did the comparison group. In a Poisson regression model in which white males and females from the study population were used, and for which the effects of age, smoking, college education category, period of hire, and years employed were controlled, scientists, engineers, and research technicians had elevated (nonsignificantly) mortality rates for leukemia and lymphatic cancer compared with managers and support staff. Smoking was an independent risk factor for leukemia and lymphatic cancer. Further work is needed to assess if specific environmental factors, such as benzene, other aromatics, radiation, medical treatment, and smoking habits, might have contributed to the above findings. \nNontraumatic surgical emergencies in children. Clinical conditions that require operative intervention are frequent causes of emergency department visits. Common causes such as pyloric stenosis, intussusception, inguinal hernias, torsion of the testicle, and ingested foreign bodies are discussed, and aids in diagnosis and early intervention are addressed. Conditions that mimic surgical problems also are mentioned. \nPost-myocardial infarction mortality in patients with ventricular premature depolarizations. Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial Pilot Study BACKGROUND. Among survivors of acute myocardial infarction, frequent and repetitive ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs) detected on ambulatory monitoring contribute independently to the risk of all-cause mortality and sudden death. Apart from the beta-blockers, no antiarrhythmic drug has been reliably demonstrated to reduce mortality among patients with VPDs. A pilot study was undertaken to gather data to aid in the design of a multicenter trial of amiodarone for the reduction of mortality from cardiac arrhythmias in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. Seventy-seven patients with acute myocardial infarction within the previous 6-30 days and 10 or more VPDs/hr or one or more runs of ventricular tachycardia on 24-hour electrocardiographic recording were randomized in a double-blind fashion in a 2:1 amiodarone-to-placebo ratio. The loading dose was 10 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. The maintenance dose was 300-400 mg/day with reductions at 4-month intervals in response to VPD suppression, excessive plasma levels, or toxicity. VPD suppression at 1 week and 2 weeks was 63% and 85%, respectively, on amiodarone and 17% and 27%, respectively, on placebo. Apart from thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation and skin reactions, no side effects occurred more frequently with amiodarone. The study drug was stopped for side effects or noncompliance in 35% of amiodarone patients and 34% of placebo patients. Patients were followed for a maximum of 2 years (mean, 20 months). Arrhythmic death or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation occurred in two of 48 amiodarone patients (6%) and four of 29 placebo patients (14%), whereas the rates of all-cause mortality were five of 48 (10%) and six of 29 (21%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Amiodarone, in moderate loading and maintenance dosages with adjustments in response to plasma levels, VPD suppression, and side effects, results in effective VPD suppression and acceptable levels of toxicity. \nProstate-type gland in the epididymis. We confirmed the presence of a prostate-type gland in the epididymis of a 30-year-old white man by immunohistochemical analysis using prostate specific antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase. We suggest possible histogenetic mechanisms for such previously undescribed morphological heterogeneity within this wolffian duct derivative. \nProliferation index in various stages of breast cancer determined by Ki-67 immunostaining. To investigate factors involved in progression of breast cancer, we estimated the growth fraction of malignant cell populations in various stages of mammary cancer growth. Frozen sections were immunostained with the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody and the proliferation index determined using static image analysis. Pure intraductal carcinoma, intraductal carcinoma coexisting with invasive disease, and metastatic sites coexisting with primary tumors were studied. The proliferation index of pure intraductal carcinomas (mean 4.5%, median 1.8%) was not significantly different from invasive mammary cancers (mean 5.1%, median 2.2%). The proliferation index determined for the in situ component of primary cancers (mean 3.8%, median 1.5%) was not significantly different from values obtained from the invasive component of growth (mean 4.2%, median 2.1%). Variability between in situ and invasive components for individual cases was minimal in tumors whose proliferation index was less than 3.0%; for tumors with higher proliferation indices, the differences were greater. However, there was no trend toward a decrease or increase in growth fraction for the two components of primary tumor",
