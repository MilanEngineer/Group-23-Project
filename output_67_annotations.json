        "text": " and CT have nearly the same accuracy in predicting resectability of tumors in patients with esophageal carcinoma. \nDiverticulitis of the duodenum: clinical and radiological manifestations of seven cases. Seven patients with duodenal diverticulitis were evaluated by computed tomography (CT) and various other abdominal imaging techniques. The series included four men and three women who ranged in age from 47 to 84 yr (mean: 65 yr). They had presented with epigastric or periumbilical pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and loss of appetite and weight due to postprandial cramps or vomiting. In each instance, the abdominal CT examination proved crucial in the diagnosis of duodenal diverticulitis, with contained perforation or inflammatory changes involving the adjacent structures. Five patients underwent laparotomy while two others were treated conservatively with antibiotics and/or percutaneous drainage of peridiverticular abscess. The clinical and radiological features of this uncommon entity are herein described, along with a brief review of the medical literature regarding the current approach to its diagnosis and management. \nCryotherapy for cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS): a phase II trial. To assess the response and toxicity of liquid nitrogen cryotherapy for cutaneous lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) associated with AIDS, we evaluated 20 subjects with biopsy-proven KS in a phase II clinical trial. Subjects had two to four cutaneous KS indicator lesions treated with liquid nitrogen cyrotherapy. Treatment was repeated at 3 week intervals, allowing adequate healing time. On average, subjects received three treatments per lesion with a mean follow-up time of 11 weeks (range of 6-25 weeks). One treatment consisted of two freeze-thaw cycles, with thaw times ranging from 11 to 60 s per cycle. A complete response was observed in 80% of treated KS lesions and lasted a minimum of 6 weeks following the completion of therapy. Greater than 50% cosmetic improvement of KS was observed. Histopathology of treated lesions correlated poorly with cosmetic improvement. Response was not predicted by tolerance to zidovudine therapy, CD4+ cell count, presence of B symptoms, or previous chemotherapy. Subjects without prior history of opportunistic infection (OI) were more likely to have a better response than those with a prior history of OI. Subjects tolerated cryotherapy well. Blistering occurred frequently, but local pain was limited and relieved by acetaminophen. Secondary infection did not occur. Based on this study, we recommend cryotherapy to subjects with cutaneous KS lesions. Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy is easily applied as a primary therapy, and may also have a role in the treatment of cutaneous KS lesions that respond slowly or show incomplete cosmetic improvement with systemic therapies. \nClinical risk factors for Alzheimer's disease: a population-based case-control study. Using information on clinical risk factors provided through the medical record linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we conducted a population-based case-control study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). During the period 1960 to 1974, we identified 415 newly diagnosed cases of AD among residents of Rochester, Minnesota, and matched one community control to each case based on age, sex, and duration of community medical record. We estimated odds ratios using conditional logistic regression for several potential clinical risk factors of AD. Among more than 20 clinical risk factors that were evaluated, the only statistically significant findings were for episodic depression, personality disorder, and hypertension. \nIncreasing incidence of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The incidence of pyloric stenosis in the Mersey region rose from 1.54/1000 births in 1976-8 to 2.22/1000 births in 1986-8. Reliance on ultrasonography for diagnosis in the 1980s resulted in fewer 'tumours' being felt; diagnostic delay was not shortened overall but serial ultrasonography showed evolving lesions in six patients. Clinical examination and selective use of ultrasonography is advocated. \nBlunt abdominal trauma resulting in intestinal obstruction: when to operate? The overall approach to blunt abdominal trauma resulting in hematoma and intestinal obstruction has been variable and controversial. Recent reports recommend conservative nonoperative management. We reviewed six cases of duodenal and jejunal hematomas resulting from blunt trauma of which five resolved with nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition. The average hospital stay was 16 days (10-23 days), and total parenteral nutrition days were 9 days (4-16 days). Upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) demonstrated partial bowel obstruction in all five cases. In contrast, the sixth case was a restrained passenger who had evidence of complete bowel obstruction on UGI series, which failed to resolve after 18 days of conservative management. Laparotomy revealed jejunal and colonic strictures with fibrosis, which were successfully resected. We recommend that based on radiologic documentation of persistent high-grade obstruction, as well as the clinical course, patients whose obstructions do not resolve by 10 to 14 days ought to be further investigated and operative intervention considered. This approach may facilitate an earlier diagnosis of complications, reduce length of hospitalization and days on parenteral nutrition, as well as to expedite the proper management. \nCold cerebroplegia. A new technique of cerebral protection during operations on the transverse aortic arch. Profound hypothermia associated with circulatory arrest is the commonest method of cerebral protection during operations on the aortic arch. This technique allows a limited time to perform the aortic repair, however. It also necessitates prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass to rewarm the patient. This may be the cause of coagulation disorders or infection. Selective perfusion of the carotid arteries can also be used. When the perfusion is derived from the main arterial line, however, the repair of the aorta requires that the vessel be crossclamped, and cannot be performed in an \"open, bloodless\" manner. To avoid the disadvantages of both techniques, we have developed a new technique of cerebral protection. After a regular cardiopulmonary bypass has been established, the carotid arteries are cannulated and perfused with blood cooled at 6 degrees to 12 degrees C, through a separate heat exchanger, while the core temperature is maintained at moderate hypothermia (25 degrees to 28 degrees C, rectal). To perform the \"open\" distal repair, the cardiopulmonary bypass is discontinued while the carotid perfusion is maintained (250 to 350 ml/min). When the distal repair is completed, cardiopulmonary bypass is resumed and the carotid perfusion is discontinued. Between 1984 and June 1989, 54 patients (mean age 55 years) were operated on with this method (45 elective operations, 9 emergency procedures). Mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 121 minutes (65 to 248), and mean duration of circulatory arrest was 22 minutes (10 to 51). The electroencephalogram, routinely recorded, showed return of the cerebral activity after a mean time of 12 minutes and normal activity after a mean time of 66 minutes. There was no intraoperative death. Hospital mortality rate was 13% (7/54). One death was related to neurologic disorders. All patients but one awakened normally within 8 hours after operation. Two patients (4.3%) experienced a transient neurologic episode (lateral hemianopia) 9 and 11 days postoperatively. There was no hemorrhagic complication (24-hour average blood loss: 840 +/- 540 ml). In our experience the technique of \"cold cerebroplegia\" has been demonstrated to provide excellent cerebral protection. It requires no prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass and does not limit the time necessary to perform the aortic repair. It may be considered as a safe alternative to profound hypothermia associated with circulatory arrest. \nLectin-reactive patterns of markedly elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein in patients with chronic active hepatitis. Four cases of chronic hepatitis associated with high serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) without hepatocellular carcinoma are reported. All showed transient elevations of serum AFP, with peak levels of 13,500, 8,000, 4,450, and 3,000 ng/ml shortly after aggravation resulting from liver function tests. Liver biopsies revealed severe parenchymal damage in all the cases with piece-meal necrosis, bridging necrosis or bridging fibrosis. In two of four cases, there was a lobular distortion. AFP stain by an immunoperoxidase method showed a positive result in surviving hepatocytes. Lectin affinity electrophoresis of AFP in the four cases, together with an additional 12 patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and 44 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, all having AFP levels above 1,000 ng/ml, revealed that the chronic hepatitis patients had a benign pattern of AFP bands, in contrast with the pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma with increased proportions of lentil lectin-reactive AFP-L3 and/or erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin-reactive AFP-P4, indicating that the analysis of lectin reactivity of AFP has a great value in differentiating the benign and malignant conditions with increased serum levels of AFP above 1,000 ng/ml. \nEffect of ST segment measurement point on performance of standard and heart rate-adjusted ST segment criteria for the identification of coronary artery disease BACKGROUND. Recent reports critical of the performance of heart rate-adjusted indexes of ST depression during exercise electrocardiography have used J-point rather than ST segment measurements. However, no standard exists for the optimal time after the J-point at which to measure ST segment deviation. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the effect of ST segment measurement position on performance of standard exercise electrocardiographic criteria, the delta ST segment/heart rate (delta ST/HR) index, and the ST segment/heart rate (ST/HR) slope for the detection of coronary artery disease, the exercise electrocardiograms of 50 clinically normal subjects and 80 patients with known or likely coronary disease were analyzed using ST depression measured at both the J-point and at 60 msec after the J-point (J + 60). A positive exercise electrocardiogram by standard criteria, defined as 0.1 mV or more of additional horizontal or downsloping ST depression at end exercise, had a specificity of 96% when ST depression was measured at either the J-point or J + 60. There was no difference in sensitivity of standard electrocardiographic criteria at J + 60 and J point (both 59%, p = NS). However, at matched specificity of 96%, the delta ST/HR index and ST/HR slope calculated using ST depression at J + 60 were significantly more sensitive (90% and 93%) than when calculated using J-point depression (64% and 61%, each p less than 0.001). Comparison of areas under respective receiver operating characteristic curves confirmed the superior performance of J + 60 as opposed to J-point measurements for both the delta ST/HR index (0.98 versus 0.89, p = 0.006) and the ST/HR slope (0.96 versus 0.87, p = 0.007) and also demonstrated modestly improved overall test performance for standard electrocardiographic criteria using J + 60 measurements (0.88 versus 0.82, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Use of J-point measurements significantly degrades performance of heart rate-adjusted indexes of ST depression but has less effect on standard criteria. \nPsychosis and physical aggression in probable Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and type of psychotic symptoms in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and to test whether there is a relationship between specific psychotic symptoms and episodes of physical aggression. METHOD: From 209 patients with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease who had been assessed in a research clinic every 6 months for up to 4.5 years, 181 subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease were selected for study. On the basis of the summary note for each visit in the patients' charts, the presence of delusions, hallucinations, misidentifications, and episodes of physical aggression was determined. Data regarding psychotic symptoms and aggression were available for 170 and 169 subjects, respectively. RESULTS: Delusions had been reported for 74 (43.5%) of the patients and were the most frequent psychotic symptom; persecutory delusions were the most common type. Physical aggression had been noted for 50 (29.6%) of the patients. Delusions and misidentifications frequently preceded and were significantly associated with episodes of physical aggression. The presence of delusions was a significant predictor of physical aggression but accounted for only 3.5% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that delusions are a risk factor for physical aggression in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease who have moderate to severe cognitive impairment. As delusions accounted for only a small percentage of the variance, further research is needed to identify other variables that may be significant predictors of physical aggression in this population. \nManagement of complicated fractures involving the orbits and nasoethmoid complex in young children. This article presents some ideas and techniques for surgical reduction of complicated orbit and nasoethmoid complex fractures in young children. Operative techniques for surgical exposure and fracture reduction and fixation have evolved from standard facial incisions and wire fixation to complete exposure of the cranium and orbits via a bicoronal scalp flap, application of rigid plating techniques, and use of cranial bone grafts when necessary. This evolution of surgical techniques has been accompanied by an overall improvement in cosmetic and functional results. \nPostmenopausal estrogen therapy and cardiovascular disease. Ten-year follow-up from the nurses' health study BACKGROUND. The effect of postmenopausal estrogen therapy on the risk of cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Our 1985 report in the Journal, based on four years of follow-up, suggested that estrogen therapy reduced the risk of coronary heart disease, but a report published simultaneously from the Framingham Study suggested that the risk was increased. In addition, studies of the effect of estrogens on stroke have yielded conflicting results. METHODS. We followed 48,470 postmenopausal women, 30 to 63 years old, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, and who did not have a history of cancer or cardiovascular disease at base line. During up to 10 years of follow-up (337,854 person-years), we documented 224 strokes, 405 cases of major coronary disease (nonfatal myocardial infarctions or deaths from coronary causes), and 1263 deaths from all causes. RESULTS. After adjustment for age and other risk factors, the overall relative risk of major coronary disease in women currently taking estrogen was 0.56 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.80); the risk was significantly reduced among women with either natural or surgical menopause. We observed no effect of the duration of estrogen use independent of age. The findings were similar in analyses limited to women who had recently visited their physicians (relative risk, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.66) and in a low-risk group that excluded women reporting current cigarette smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or a Quetelet index above the 90th percentile (relative risk, 0.53; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.91). The relative risk for current and former users of estrogen as compared with those who had never used it was 0.89 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.00) for total mortality and 0.72 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.95) for mortality from cardiovascular disease. The relative risk of stroke when current users were compared with those who had never used estrogen was 0.97 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.45), with no marked differences according to type of stroke. CONCLUSIONS. Current estrogen use is associated with a reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease as well as in mortality from cardiovascular disease, but it is not associated with any change in the risk of stroke. \nThe short test of mental status. Correlations with standardized psychometric testing. The Short Test of Mental Status can be administered to patients in inpatient and outpatient settings in approximately 5 minutes, and it contains items that test orientation, attention, immediate recall, arithmetic, abstraction, construction, information, and delayed (approximately 3 minutes) recall. The test was administered to a group of demented community patients and their age- and sex-matched control subjects. Using an age-adjusted approach, sensitivity of the test to identifying dementia is 86.4, with a specificity of 93.5. The test was compared with standardized tests of cognitive function such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Mattis Dementia Scale, and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and showed a high degree of correlation. Group means and standard deviations for subtest items and total score are presented for control subjects (n = 138), demented patients (n = 130), and patients with memory impairment only (n = 20). Percentile scores for subtest items in control subjects are also provided. \nRelationship of echocardiographic, shunt flow, and angiographic size to the stretched diameter of the atrial septal defect. Stretched diameter of the atrial septal defect (ASD), measured by balloon sizing, is generally used as a guide to the selection of the size of the device utilized for transcatheter closure of the ASD. Balloon sizing is a cumbersome procedure and sometimes requires the use of very large size balloon catheters. Several methods of assessment of ASD size, namely, echographic, pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs), and angiographic measures, were undertaken in a group of 16 patients, aged 7 months to 45 years (median, 4.5 years), who were being evaluated for transcatheter closure of ASD; the results were compared with the stretched diameter. Although the echographic size of the ASD (9.9 +/- 4.1 mm, mean +/- SD) is similar (p greater than 0.1) to the angiographic size (7.9 +/- 2.5 mm), it is much smaller (p less than 0.01) than the stretched diameter (16.1 +/- 5.3 mm). When the relationship between various measures of ASD was examined, although the Qp:Qs ratio and angiographic size have a significant (p less than 0.05) correlation with the stretched diameter (r = 0.55 and 0.54, respectively), the echo diameter has the best correlation coefficient, r = 0.82, p less than 0.001. The stretched diameter can be estimated by the equation: 1.05 x echo + 5.49 mm. It is concluded that the echographic diameter is a useful adjunct in the estimation of the stretch ASD diameter, which in turn can be used in the selection of the size of the device for transcatheter occlusion of the ASD. \nPattern of cell kinetics in colorectal mucosa of patients with different types of adenomatous polyps of the large bowel. It is generally accepted that adenomatous polyps represent the natural precursor of many colorectal malignancies. The sequence, however, which leads from a normally appearing mucosa to cancer is complex and involves many steps, including a hyperproliferative mucosa with an upward expansion of the replicative compartment. The current study evaluates cell replication in normal colorectal mucosa of patients with adenomatous polyps of various types and relates the observed findings to the main clinical and morphologic features of adenomas. Forty-four patients with polyps and 27 controls entered the study. Samples of colorectal mucosa were taken at endoscopy and cell replication was evaluated with a standard autoradiographic procedure. Cell replication was expressed as labeling index (LI), in the whole crypt and in each of the five longitudinal compartments in which the crypts were divided. Total LI and LI per crypt compartment were significantly higher (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.01, respectively) than in controls. There was no appreciable difference of LI values between patients with single or multiple, tubular or tubulovillous, small or large adenomas, but in all of these subgroups LI was significantly higher than in controls. In conclusion, in normally appearing colorectal mucosa of patients with adenomatous polyps there was a significant increase of cell replication and a marked upward expansion of the proliferative zone; these changes were more evident in the left colon and in the rectum. Finally, cell replication did not seem to be related to the number of polyps, to the most common histotypes, or to the pattern of recurrence. \nA new manifestation and treatment alternative for heparin-induced thrombosis. We treated a coronary artery bypass patient whose postoperative course was complicated by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and resultant pulmonary artery and saphenous vein graft thromboses. The pulmonary thromboemboli were found first, and pulmonary blood flow was restored with intravenously administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A short time later, the vein grafts were found to be occluded, and we subsequently performed multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) using tPA as an adjuvant to oral warfarin sodium therapy with excellent results. We conclude that heparin-induced thromboses in the pulmonary arteries are amenable to thrombolytic therapy, including tPA, whereas this regimen appears to have little effect on saphenous vein grafts. We also found that a combination of warfarin and thrombolytic therapy is an alternative regimen for heparin-intolerant patients who require PTCA. \nBlood glucose control and albuminuria in type 1 diabetes mellitus. The relationship between long-term blood glucose control and albuminuria in type 1 diabetes was investigated in 42 male and 58 female patients who had had diabetes mellitus for more than 7 years. Their mean (+/- SD) age and diabetes duration were 18.6 +/- 3.6 and 12.1 +/- 3.5 years, respectively. For periods of observation ranging from 1 to 6 years (mean 4.4 +/- 1.5), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured two to six times yearly (mean of 8.8 +/- 3.9 determinations per patient). Albumin excretion rate (AER) was measured in single-void urine samples two to four times in 93 patients and once in the other seven patients. The 52 patients with mean HbA1c no more than 9.0% had significantly lower mean AER than those whose HbA1c was greater than 9.0% (20.1 +/- 24.6 vs 265 +/- 1005 mg/gm Cr, p less than 0.001). Only five (9.6%) of these 52 patients had elevated AER values (greater than 40 mg/gm Cr), whereas 21 (43.7%) of 48 patients whose mean HbA1c was greater than 9.0% had elevated AER values (p less than 0.001). Six male but no female patients had mean AER values greater than 300 mg/gm Cr. The 74 patients with normal AER had significantly lower mean HbA1c values than the 26 with elevated AER (8.6 +/- 1.5 vs 10.1 +/- 1.6%, p less than 0.001). These results support the contention that maintenance of HbA1c levels at no more than 9% (one and one-half times the upper limit of normal) will significantly decrease the likelihood that diabetic nephropathy will develop. \nMassive cystic ureteral diverticula in infancy. We report 2 cases of massive abdominal distension due to a mid ureteral diverticulum. In a 1-year-old boy the mid ureteral diverticulum was associated with an atrophied chronically scarred kidney. In a female newborn the diverticulum was associated with an upper pole ureter of a completely duplicated system. To our knowledge this type of ureteral diverticulum has not been reported previously. \nNeuronal and glial properties of a murine transgenic retinoblastoma model. Antigenic properties of a murine transgenic model for hereditary retinoblastoma, induced by a chimeric gene coding for Simian virus 40 large T antigen, an oncogene that inactivates the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, were studied by immunohistochemistry. All transgenic mice develop bilateral intraocular retinal tumors in the inner nuclear layer with Homer Wright-like rosettes, and one quarter develop midbrain tumors resembling trilateral retinoblastoma. Cell lines TE-1 and TM-1 were established from intraocular and metastatic tumors, respectively. Intraocular tumors reacted with antibodies to neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin, while vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic, and S-100 proteins were detected only in reactive glia derived from adjacent retina. The midbrain tumors showed weak reactivity to synaptophysin, and they blended with reactive astrocytes positive for glial markers. The tumors were negative for cytokeratins. Finally both derived cell lines expressed synaptophysin and individual neurofilament triplet proteins in immunofluorescence and Western blotting, supporting their essentially neuronal nature. The antigenic profile resembles human retinoblastoma, but differences in morphology and antigen distribution suggest a more close relationship to neurons of the inner nuclear layer than to photoreceptor cells. \nQuantitation of early myocardial ischemia using acridine orange fluorescence--an experimental study. It has been observed in the present investigation that ischemic myocardium consistently produces bright green fluorescence after Acridine Orange (AO) staining. The area of ischemia in the left ventricular myocardium at different time intervals after onset of experimental ischemia has been calculated by use of this AO fluorescence technique. Zonal distribution of ischemia in the epicardial, middle, and endocardial zones has also been evaluated quantitatively from ten minutes to six hours after ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery in the Wistar strain of albino rats. No similar study was available for comparison from the literature reviewed. The total area of left ventricular ischemia showed an increase with the prolongation of duration of coronary ligation from 13.39 +/- 2.69 mm2 at ten to twenty-five minutes to 32.99 +/- 5.69 mm2 at six hours after ligation. Statistical analysis of the zonal area of ischemia has shown that ischemia in the middle and endocardial zones was greater than that in the epicardial zone at all time intervals recorded. Middle zone ischemia extended over a larger area than that over the endocardial zone at all intervals except at intervals II (30-45 min), IV (2-2 1/2 hrs) and V (3-4 hrs). The results of this experimental investigation are significant for these point to the value of Acridine Orange fluorescence in detecting early myocardial ischemia and in demarcating zonal differences in ischemia. The authors have successfully utilized the method in a few human cases of clinically suspected myocardial infarction and recommend the technique for routine use to detect early human myocardial ischemia. \nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome Four cases of T-cell lymphoma occurring in the setting of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been reported previously. We describe a 46-year-old man with AIDS in whom a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with lymph node involvement developed. Immunohistochemical staining of the skin revealed the lymphoid infiltrate to be CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and T-cell antigen receptor alpha/beta positive. Co-infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I was not detected by polymerase chain reaction. Human immunodeficiency virus infection may have contributed to the development of this patient's lymphoma. This case represents the rare occurrence of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and AIDS. \nThe hemodynamic effects of intubation during nitroglycerin infusion in severe preeclampsia. The effectiveness of intravenous nitroglycerin infusion in lowering maternal blood pressure and in blunting the hemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation was evaluated in six primigravid women with severe preeclampsia. Monitoring consisted of continuous electrocardiogram monitoring, arterial cannulation, and flow-directed pulmonary arterial catheterization in each patient. All patients underwent oxytocin induction of labor and crystalloid and/or colloid expansion to produce a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10 to 15 mm Hg and a colloid osmotic pressure of greater than 17 mm Hg. Intravenous nitroglycerin was administered before induction of general anesthesia. The hemodynamic effects associated with endotracheal intubation revealed a change in the heart rate from 104 +/- 10 to 133 +/- 17 beats/min, an increase in mean arterial pressure from 134 +/- 12 to 164 +/- 32 mm Hg, and an increase in systemic vascular resistance from 1262 +/- 342 to 1351 +/- 259 dynes-sec-cm-5 that was accompanied by a small change in the cardiac index from 4.5 +/- 1.2 to 4.5 +/- 0.9 L.min-1.m-2. \nMalignant prolactinomas. Six cases of malignant prolactinoma have been reported; an additional two cases are presented here and the literature is reviewed. Diagnosis rests upon evidence of metastasis rather than histological criteria per se. Cases have arisen from known adenomas, particularly the invasive type. Bromocriptine is a useful palliative. The features and treatment of malignant prolactinoma are discussed. \nEvaluation of extracranial-to-intracranial bypass surgery using iodine 123 iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography. Eleven patients with occlusive cerebrovascular diseases were imaged with N-isopropyl-p-I-123 iodoamphetamine. Preoperative and postoperative single-photon emission computed tomography was performed in 10 patients undergoing extracranial-to-intracranial bypass procedures. New images were reconstructed from the two images obtained on the different days by superimposition and division in each pixel to get the ratio of cerebral perfusion change. All patients with bypass procedures had an increase in cerebral blood flow in the affected areas, and nine of 10 had an increase in cerebral blood flow in the contralateral cortex. There was no increase in cerebral blood flow in one case with no operation. Neither our procedure nor the results in this small series prove that recovery of function is due to an increase in blood flow, but we believe this is the case. \nLaser balloon angioplasty: clinical, angiographic and histologic results. Laser balloon angioplasty combines conventional coronary angioplasty with laser energy to transiently heat vascular tissue. Laser balloon angioplasty, was performed in 21 patients (aged 56 +/- 13 years), including 10 patients treated urgently after acute failure of conventional angioplasty and 11 patients treated with elective laser balloon angioplasty. Immediately after conventional angioplasty, laser doses (1 to 10 doses of 205 to 380 J each) were delivered during inflation of the laser balloon to a pressure of 4 atm. Seven (70%) of 10 patients with acute failure of conventional angioplasty were successfully treated with laser balloon angioplasty, but 3 (30%) were unsuccessfully treated with the laser procedure and required emergency coronary artery bypass surgery. In all three failures, the 3 mm laser balloon angioplasty catheter was not the optimal size for the vessel. In the 11 patients treated with elective laser balloon angioplasty (reference diameter 2.94 +/- 0.22 mm), the minimal luminal diameter increased from 0.45 +/- 0.25 to 1.85 +/- 0.46 mm after conventional angioplasty and to 2.44 +/- 0.29 mm after laser balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). This corresponded to a decrease in diameter stenosis from 84 +/- 9% before to 35 +/- 16% after conventional angioplasty and to 15 +/- 10% after laser balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). There were no instances of myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass surgery or death and no acute complications related to delivery of laser energy in this group. Follow-up coronary angiography was performed 5.5 +/- 1.1 months after laser balloon angioplasty in 18 patients discharged from the hospital after a successful procedure. Ten patients (56%) had angiographic restenosis, defined as recurrent diameter stenosis greater than 50%. Six patients were subsequently treated by directional coronary atherectomy, which revealed intimal proliferation indistinguishable from that in patients with restenosis after conventional angioplasty. In conclusion, laser balloon angioplasty may be effective in sealing severe coronary dissections and reversing abrupt closure associated with failed conventional angioplasty. After uncomplicated conventional angioplasty, laser balloon angioplasty improves immediate luminal dimensions, but restenosis appears to be mediated by intimal hyperplasia, similar to that seen after conventional angioplasty. \nLaser cordectomy for T1 glottic carcinoma: a 10-year experience and videostroboscopic findings. Fifty-three patients underwent laser cordectomy for T1 glottic squamous cell carcinoma between January 1980 and December 1989--sixteen after having undergone unsuccessful radiation and thirty-seven who had no previous treatment. There was a 51% five-year cure rate in the irradiated group vs. 62% in the nonirradiated group. Extension of tumor to the anterior commissure resulted in a higher failure rate. Patients experienced an overall 5-year cure rate of 98% after surgical or radiation salvage of unsuccessful laser cordectomies. Six patients had preoperative and postoperative videostrobolaryngoscopy. The most common postoperative problem with voice was a breathiness that did not resolve in any of the patients. All patients had absent or moderately reduced amplitude and mucosal wave patterns and imcomplete glottic closure proportional to the amount of cordal tissue removed. Despite it seemingly poor results in carefully selected patients, laser cordectomy is still indicated without compromising the ultimate oncologic results. Advantages over radiation therapy or conservation laryngeal surgery include a short treatment time, requiring only an outpatient surgical procedure at the time of the initial diagnostic and/or staging laryngoscopy, and the avoidance of potential radiation side effects or surgical complications. However, patients should be advised the possibility of persistent postoperative breathy dysphonia, in addition to the possibility of further treatment to effect a long-term cure. \nNorth American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. Methods, patient characteristics, and progress. Fifty North American centers have combined to evaluate the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in randomized patients who have experienced symptoms related to arteriosclerotic stenosis of the carotid artery and who have received either best medical therapy alone or best medical therapy plus carotid endarterectomy. The outcome events are nonfatal and fatal stroke or death. A three-tier system identifies and adjudicates the type, severity, and location of each stroke and the cause of any death. Data about patients submitted to carotid endarterectomy outside the trial are compiled at the Nonrandomized Data Center at the Mayo Clinic. Between December 27, 1987, and October 1, 1990, 1,212 patients were randomized, 596 to medical therapy, 616 to carotid endarterectomy. Cross-over from the medical to the surgical arm has been low (4.2%). Patients eligible for the trial, but not randomized totaled 1,044; their characteristics were similar to those randomized so that, for the type of symptomatic patient in this study, our conclusions about the benefit of carotid endarterectomy can be generalized. Patients excluded by medical criteria totaled 679. Another 1,591 had carotid endarterectomy, but either lacked the disease under study, were asymptomatic, or received inadequate investigation to meet entry criteria. We set sample size at 1,900 patients, with continuing enrollment. The Monitoring Committee reviews at intervals the confidential analyses performed on the groups with moderate (30-69%) and severe (70-99%) stenosis. Stopping rules will be invoked for one or both groups if unequivocal benefit or harm is identified. \nContinuous automated monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials in posttraumatic coma. Using a microcomputer system, 36 patients were continuously monitored with somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) following closed head injury. The mean duration of monitoring was five days. The patients' GCS scores at the start of monitoring ranged from 3-10. Mortality was 44%. Of 14 patients who had initial absence of SSEP activity after the N20 wave or lost this activity during the period of monitoring, 12 died and two remained vegetative. Eighteen of 22 patients who had preservation or enhancement of this activity had a functional survival (3-month outcomes, p less than 0.001). The best outcomes were observed in the patients with the greatest number of peaks and highest amplitudes in the SSEPs, often in spite of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The management of three patients was altered as a result of SSEP monitoring. We conclude that continuous monitoring of SSEPs is a useful adjunct in the management of comatose head-injured patients. \nProstate specific antigen after irradiation for prostatic carcinoma. The clinical significance of serum prostate specific antigen after primary irradiation for adenocarcinoma of the prostate is uncertain. Between September 1986 and December 1987 serial prostate specific antigen values were determined in 43 patients before and after definitive radiation therapy. The study group included 6 patients with stage T0d, 10 with stage T1, 11 with stage T2 and 16 with stage T3 disease, with a mean pre-treatment prostate specific antigen level of 49.2 +/- 10.8. For all patients the first post-treatment prostate specific antigen level was less than the pre-treatment level. One patient failed locally with recurrent prostatic cancer that invaded the rectum. The 6 patients who failed with symptomatic metastases had an increasing prostate specific antigen level 2 to 7 months before detection of recurrence. Based on the absolute value and trend of the prostate specific antigen, patients were described as being at high, intermediate or low risk for distant metastases. Of 9 high, 6 intermediate and 28 low risk patients 4 (44%), 2 (33%) and 0 (0%) have experienced recurrent disease (p = 0.0025). We conclude that serial post-irradiation prostate specific antigen values may be useful in the early identification of patients at risk for treatment failure. \nComplications of infection and immunologic status after surgery for patients with esophageal cancer. Correlations between defective cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and infections following surgery for esophageal cancer were evaluated. Peripheral lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, PHA transformation, and PPD skin test were measured in 81 patients with esophageal cancer, 58 with gastric cancer, and 50 healthy controls. The depression of CMI was predominant to a similar extent in patients with esophageal cancer and in those with gastric cancer. The average level of PHA transformation immediately before surgery was significantly lower in the esophageal cancer patients with fatal septic complications than in those without such problems. Although preoperative radiation therapy markedly depressed the levels of the four parameters, this association was also noted in 28 patients not given radiation. It thus appears that PHA transformation may be valuable in the prediction of fatal septic complications after major surgery in patients with esophageal cancer. \nEvidence from cadavers suggestive of entrapment of fifth lumbar spinal nerves by lumbosacral ligaments. Lumbosacral spines from 51 geriatric-age cadavers (25 men and 26 women) were examined both grossly and under the dissecting microscope for evidence of compression of fifth lumbar spinal nerves by their respective lumbosacral ligaments. These ligaments were found to extend from the transverse process and body of L5 to the ala of the sacrum in 97% of the specimens, and from the transverse process and body of L5 to the promontory of the sacrum in 3% of the specimens. Anterior primary rami of the fifth lumbar spinal nerve were observed to be compressed in 11% (11 of 102) of the specimens examined grossly and under the dissecting microscope. Histologic evidence of chronic compression, as suggested by perineurial and endoneurial fibrosis, peripheral thinning of myelin sheaths, or subjective evidence of a shift in fiber diameter to a population of smaller size fibers was found, deep to the lumbosacral ligament, in three of the 11 nerves judged to be compressed. The information derived is of interest to the clinician whose patient presents with L5 root signs and a myelogram, discogram, and computed tomographic scan which do not show any abnormality. The possibility of extraforaminal compression must be considered as a possible source of the clinical signs. \nThe use of transdermal scopolamine to control drooling. A case report. Drooling is a serious social handicap experienced by some neurologically impaired patients. No one method has been identified to control drooling for all patients, however, anticholinergic drugs recently have been utilized. In the case study described, transdermal scopolamine patches were found to be effective for controlling drooling in a traumatic brain-injured patient for whom more conservative methods failed. From a baseline saliva flow rate, saliva flow decreased an average of 30% with one-patch and 59% with two-patch dosing. No significant side effects were observed with treatment, and the decrease in drooling was maintained for a 4-month period. Although transdermal scopolamine may represent one acceptable facet of long-term treatment, it must be stressed that efficacy is variable across patient populations and that treatment approaches must be individualized. \nGastric collision tumor (carcinoid and adenocarcinoma) with gastritis cystica profunda. We report a rare case of gastric collision tumor (carcinoid and adenocarcinoma) with gastritis cystica profunda that developed in a 49-year-old Japanese man. Early gastric cancer (moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) was present at the edge of an ulcer in the posterior wall of the upper gastric body. In addition, a carcinoid tumor was found adjacent to adenocarcinoma. This tumor displayed ribbonlike or trabecular patterns, and numerous constituent cells were positive for the argyrophil reaction with Grimelius' stain and serotonin. Electron microscopic features of this tumor confirmed typical carcinoid. There was no merged appearance between both tumors, suggesting collision-type tumor. \nNeopterin and interferon-gamma in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HIV-associated neurologic disease. We measured the levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and neopterin in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of 121 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive (HIV+) and 62-seronegative (HIV-) individuals evaluated for neurologic disease. CSF levels of IFN-gamma and serum and CSF levels of neopterin were higher in HIV+ than in HIV- individuals. Patients with HIV- related meningitis and with opportunistic CNS infections had higher serum neopterin levels than HIV+ asymptomatic individuals. CSF levels of IFN-gamma were slightly higher in CSF of HIV+ individuals in all groups (0.31 +/- 0.03 U/ml) than in HIV- individuals (0.12 +/- 0.03). CSF levels of neopterin were similar in HIV+ asymptomatic individuals (6.9 +/- 0.7 nmol/l) and HIV- individuals (5.9 +/- 1.1), but were elevated in those HIV-infected individuals with neurologic disease, particularly patients with HIV-associated meningitis (72.1 +/- 13.3 nmol/l), opportunistic CNS infections (36 +/- 9.1), and inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (32.4 +/- 17.2). Levels of neopterin correlated positively with levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor and soluble CD8, 2 additional indicators of immune activation. In the absence of neurologic disease, levels of IFN-gamma and neopterin in both serum and CSF were stable for up to 4 years after seroconversion. These data suggest that increased CSF neopterin is associated with HIV-associated neurologic disease. \nSerum immunoglobulin G subclasses in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. We studied serum concentrations of IgG subclasses in 47 human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected (17 asymptomatic and 30 symptomatic) children. Thirty-nine of 47 (83%) had an abnormality of at least 1 subclass. Sixteen had only elevated IgG1, 6 had only elevated IgG3 and 12 had elevated IgG1 and IgG3 concentrations. IgG2, IgG4 and combined IgG2-IgG4 deficiency was found in 3, 4 and 4 patients, respectively. IgG2 concentrations did not differ between patients with (n = 23) or without (n = 24) bacterial infections. Additionally the number of bacterial infections was similar between the patients with normal or low IgG2 and/or low IgG4. These data indicate that IgG subclass abnormalities are found in most children with human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection, but quantitative deficiencies of specific subclasses do not appear to explain the high frequency of bacterial infections occurring in these patients. \nThe bladder cooling test for urodynamic assessment: analysis of 400 examinations. The clinical significance of the bladder cooling test as one part of a standard urodynamic examination was studied in 375 consecutive patients and 25 controls. Inability to perceive cold sensation in the bladder was common in cases of neurogenic lesions and present in nearly half of the patients with outlet obstruction, some with no urodynamic abnormalities and some of the normal subjects. The bladder contractions provoked by the test were clearly associated with detrusor overactivity, as in those patients with upper motor neuron lesions of motor urgency, but 27% of such patients showed no response. In 7 cases the iced water provoked detrusor contractions when cystometry showed no overactivity. This clinical series confirms that the cold receptors found recently in animal experiments are also present in the human urinary bladder. The bladder cooling test is not an alternative to cystometry, but its inclusion as an integral part of the urodynamic examination seems to be useful, especially in cases where there is also a need to study the sensibility of the bladder at the same time. \nChoroideremia and deafness with stapes fixation: a contiguous gene deletion syndrome in Xq21. The study of contiguous gene deletion syndromes by using reverse genetic techniques provides a powerful tool for precisely defining the map location of the genes involved. We have made use of individuals with overlapping deletions producing choroideremia as part of a complex phenotype, to define the boundaries on the X chromosome for this gene, as well as for X-linked mixed deafness with perilymphatic gusher (DFN3). Two patients with deletions and choroideremia are affected by an X-linked mixed conductive/sensorineural deafness; one patient, XL-62, was confirmed at surgery to have DFN3, while the other patient, XL-45, is suspected clinically to have the same disorder. A third choroideremia deletion patient, MBU, has normal hearing. Patient XL-62 has a cytogenetically detectable deletion that was measured to be 7.7% of the X chromosome by dual laser flow cytometry; the other patient, XL-45, has a cytogenetically undetectable deletion that measures only 3.3% of the X chromosome. We have produced a physical map of the X-chromosome region containing choroideremia and DFN3 by using routine Southern blotting, chromosome walking and jumping techniques, and long-range restriction mapping to generate and link anonymous DNA sequences in this region. DXS232 and DXS233 are located within 450 kb of each other on the same SfiI and MluI fragments and share partial SalI fragments of 750 and greater than 1,000 kb but are separated by at least one SalI site. In addition, DXS232, which lies outside the MBU deletion, detects the proximal breakpoint of this deletion. We have isolated two new anonymous DNA sequences by chromosome jumping from DXS233; one of these detects a new SfiI fragment distal to DXS233 in the direction of the choroideremia gene, while the other jump clone is proximal to DXS233 and detects a new polymorphism. These data refine the map around the loci for choroideremia and for mixed deafness with stapes fixation and will provide points from which to isolate candidate gene sequences for these disorders. \nMycobacterial infections after renal transplantation. Mycobacterial infections occurred in 11 of 633 (1.7 per cent) recipients of successful renal transplants. There were no cases of tuberculosis in patients receiving chemoprophylaxis, but amongst those who did not receive prophylaxis disease occurred in six of the 27 (22 per cent) high-risk patients. The major cause of morbidity during treatment was renal allograft rejection, largely due to reduction in immunosuppressive drug therapy. \nFacial reanimation after acoustic neuroma excision: the patient's perspective. Facial reanimation after acoustic neuroma excision is currently accomplished using a variety of surgical techniques. A multi-institutional survey of patient perceptions of facial reanimation success was accomplished by mailing a questionnaire to 809 randomly selected members of the Acoustic Neuroma Association. Four hundred sixty patients who underwent 296 reanimation procedures responded. Facial to hypoglossal nerve anastomosis, tarsorrhaphy, and upper eyelid implants were most frequently performed. The patient's estimations of initial deficit, spontaneous recovery, and overall satisfaction with the reanimation procedures are discussed. \nSuccessful shock-wave lithotripsy of bile duct stones using ultrasound guidance. Eighteen patients with 41 gallstones in the common bile duct, common hepatic, cystic, and intrahepatic ducts underwent shock-wave lithotripsy using the electrohydraulic Sonolith 3000 lithotripter. Lithotripsy was performed using ultrasound guidance alone under intravenous analgesia/sedation. All patients previously had failed stone extraction via retrograde endoscopy, T-tube, or cholecystostomy. Lithotripsy was performed according to an FDA-approved protocol allowing a maximum of two 2500 shock-wave treatments at a 48 hr interval. Following the final lithotripsy or cholangiographic evidence of stone fragmentation, residual fragments were removed via endoscopic or percutaneous route within 24-72 hr. Ultrasound localization of gallstones was aided by continuous infusion of the common bile duct with saline solution. In 15 of the 18 patients, complete fragmentation of the stones was accomplished, two had minimal fragmentation, and one with an encysted stone had no fracturing. No serious complications were encountered. Overall nonsurgical stone-free success rate was 17 of 18 patients, indicating biliary duct stones can be successfully treated using an ultrasound-guided lithotripter and intravenous sedation alone. \nDifferentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells induced by the c-jun and activated c-Ha-ras oncogenes. The activated c-Ha-ras oncogene induced AP1-site DNA-binding activity in F9 cells. This induction appeared to be due, at least in part, to the induction of c-jun transcription. Both activated c-Ha-ras and c-jun induced the differentiation of F9 cells to endoderm-like cells. Thus, AP1 appears to play a key role in the initial stage of F9 cell differentiation. \nPseudolymphoma of the parapharyngeal space. A case report of pseudolymphoma of the parapharyngeal space is presented, together with a literature review of pseudolymphoma and management suggestions for such lesions when they occur in the head and neck. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this represents the first case report of pseudolymphoma presenting within the parapharyngeal space. The key to management of these lesions is based on accurate diagnosis, with differentiation of pseudolymphoma from lymphocytic lymphoma, the disease process which it mimics. \nEffect of level of patient acuity on clinical decision making of critical care nurses with varying levels of knowledge and experience. This study is an examination of the effect of patient acuity on the clinical decision making of critical care nurses (N = 68) completing two computerized clinical simulations. Ventricular tachycardia represented the high-acuity situation and atrial flutter the lower-acuity situation. Clinical decision making was measured by proficiency score, patient outcome (cure or die), and amount of data collected. Analyses of variance were conducted to examine proficiency score and the amount of data collected. Fisher's exact test and the McNemar test of homogeneity of proportions were used to examine patient outcome. In the atrial flutter simulation, proficiency scores were higher (p = 0.000), more dysrhythmias were cured (p less than 0.005), and more data were collected (p = 0.040). Experienced and inexperienced nurses did not differ on proficiency score; however, inexperienced nurses collected more data (p = 0.048) and cured fewer atrial flutter simulations (p = 0.040). Nurses certified in advanced cardiac life support had higher proficiency scores (p = 0.033) and collected fewer data (p = 0.048). \nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a patient with a cadaveric dural graft. We report a 26-year-old woman with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) who had received cadaveric dural material 33 months before the onset of neurologic symptoms. This is the fourth case in which a dural graft was the putative source of the CJD agent. All four cases had the grafting before changes in the sterilization procedure adopted in 1987 to inactivate the CJD agent. \nIntraoperative death during lumbar discectomy. A patient suffered cardiovascular collapse and died during surgery for prolapsed intervertebral disc. At postmortem a tear was found in the abdominal aorta. \nFlexible sigmoidoscopy screening for asymptomatic colorectal disease in patients with and without inguinal hernia. Several studies have evaluated the diagnostic value of flexible sigmoidoscopy for screening asymptomatic patients before hernia repair. All have shown a 16% to 28% incidence of neoplastic (malignant or premalignant) lesions. None of these studies compared a similar group of asymptomatic patients without hernia to determine whether the incidence is increased in patients with hernias. We reviewed 87 consecutive cases of male surgical patients without hernia or any anorectal disease who had flexible sigmoidoscopy between June 1986 and December 1989 (group 1) and compared them with a group of hernia patients that we previously reported (group 2). Patients with stool positive for occult blood were excluded from this study. Examinations in both groups were done under the direct supervision of an attending surgeon (W.W., C.S.C., or J.K.). No significant difference was noted between group 1 and group 2 in mean age (mean 65.6 vs 59.7 years), rate of normal findings (68% vs 63%), and incidence of neoplastic lesions (14% vs 22%). All patients tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications. \nThe natural history of superficial femoral artery stenoses. Since the natural history of specific superficial femoral artery stenoses is not known, we examined progression rates of superficial femoral artery stenoses in 45 lower extremities found when arteriograms were obtained of 38 patients for symptomatic atherosclerotic disease in the opposite leg or abdomen. These initial superficial femoral artery arteriograms were compared with later arteriograms in 25 limbs, duplex scans in 27 limbs, and both modalities in 7 limbs. After a mean interval of 37 months, most superficial femoral artery stenoses (72%) did not progress. However, 12 superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed (28%; mean follow-up, 37 months, including 7 that occluded (17%). Superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed among patients who complained of symptom progression at a rate faster than that among asymptomatic patients (15.6%/year vs 3%/year; p = 0.006). Superficial femoral artery lesions also progressed more rapidly among patients whose contralateral superficial femoral artery was occluded (10%/year vs 1.6%/year; p = 0.04). By multivariate regression analysis, symptom progression and smoking history were predictive of superficial femoral artery stenosis progression. In the seven patients whose superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed to occlusion, the average rate of stenosis progression was 12%/year (maximum predicted rate, 30% per year by 95% confidence limit). These results indicate that superficial femoral artery stenoses usually progress with synchronous symptomatic deterioration. Other than symptom progression, only cumulative smoking history and contralateral superficial femoral artery occlusion could be associated with superficial femoral artery stenosis progression in this small series. \nHyperglycemia and neurological outcome in patients with head injury. To examine the relationship between serum glucose and the outcome of patients suffering from head injury, the authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 169 patients admitted for treatment to Harborview Medical Center (a regional trauma center). All patients underwent craniotomy for evacuation of intracranial hematoma and/or placement of a subarachnoid bolt for intracranial pressure monitoring under general anesthesia. Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less had significantly higher serum glucose levels than patients with GCS scores of 12 to 15 (mean +/- standard error of the mean 192 +/- 7 mg/dl vs. 130 +/- 8 mg/dl or 10.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter vs. 7.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter) (p less than 0.0001). Patients who subsequently remained in a vegetative state or died had significantly higher glucose levels both on admission and postoperatively than patients who had good outcome or moderate disability (217 +/- 12 mg/dl vs. 167 +/- 6 mg/dl or 12.1 +/- 0.7 mmol/liter vs. 9.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter on admission, and 240 +/- 16 mg/dl vs. 156 +/- 5 mg/dl or 13.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/liter vs. 8.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter postoperatively) (p less than 0.0001). Among the more severely injured patients (GCS score less than or equal to 8), a serum glucose level greater than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/liter) postoperatively is associated with a significantly worse outcome (p less than 0.01). The authors conclude that severely head-injured patients frequently develop hyperglycemia and the elevated serum glucose level may aggravate ischemic insults and worsen the neurological outcome in such patients. \nHuman peripheral blood lymphocytes targeted with bispecific antibodies release cytokines that are essential for inhibiting tumor growth. We have compared the mechanisms by which human PBL targeted with bispecific antibodies either lyse tumor cells or block their growth in culture or in mice. We found that resting PBL were unable to mediate lysis, but were able to block tumor growth. Moreover, targeted PBL were unable to lyse bystander cells, whereas targeted PBL did block the growth of bystander tumor cells in culture and in nude mice. Supernatants from cultures of targeted PBL, or from PBL grown on anti-CD3-coated flasks, blocked the growth of tumor cells in the absence of added effector cells, and antibodies against TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma reversed the inhibition of tumor growth, but had no effect upon cytolysis mediated by targeted by PBL. Our results show that targeted human PBL mediate two different antitumor activities: lysis, which occurs rapidly and requires the direct attachment of the target cell to the cytotoxic cell, and tumor growth inhibition, which is mediated by cytokines released into the medium as a result of receptor cross-linking. The inhibition of bystander tumor growth in mice by targeted PBL suggests that factor release is sufficient to block tumor growth in vivo. Targeted factor release therefore provides a mechanism by which targeted PBL could block the growth of tumor cells in vivo that were not bound by the effector cells, but which were located in the vicinity of tumor cells that were bound. \nDigital artery embolization as a result of fibromuscular dysplasia of the brachial artery. A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of a blue, painful right index finger, and the condition progressed to digital ulceration. The ulcer gradually healed over a period of 2 months. Peripheral pulses, Doppler-derived brachial and radial systolic pressures, and results of an echocardiogram were normal. Digital pulse volume recordings showed obstructive waveforms in all digits of the right hand. Arteriography showed a normal arch and normal innominate, subclavian, and axillary arteries. The midbrachial artery was markedly abnormal and had alternating areas of stenosis and aneurysm formation. Multiple occlusions involved the palmar arch and proper digital arteries. The abnormal brachial artery segment was excised and replaced with an autogenous reversed saphenous-vein conduit. Histologic examination confirmed the lesion to be medial fibromuscular dysplasia. Fibromuscular dysplasia that involves upper extremity arteries is extremely uncommon and rarely presents with digital artery embolization. This case emphasizes the importance of exclusion of proximal reconstructible arterial occlusive disease by means of complete arteriographic examination of patients who were admitted with unilateral finger or hand ischemia. \nIntracranial hemorrhage and hemophilia: case report and management guidelines. Hemophiliacs, as a result of low coagulation factor levels, may suffer spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. A case of intracranial hemorrhage in a hemophiliac patient with a history of intravenous drug abuse and HIV infection is reported. Factor replacement, airway management, and risks of HIV exposure to emergency department personnel are discussed. \nCerebral sparganosis: case report and review. Sparganosis is a rare infection caused by a tapeworm larva from the genus Spirometra. A 21-year-old Indian man presented with an 18-month history of episodic confusion followed by a grand mal seizure. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed the presence of a lesion of the left occipital lobe. Subsequent stereotactic biopsy revealed a plerocercoid larva or sparganum. Surgical resection resulted in cure. This case prompted a review of the literature on central nervous system sparganosis. Altogether, 17 other cases of primary cerebral sparganosis have been reported previously. Seizures, headache, and focal neurologic signs are common at presentation. Neuroradiologic imaging is sensitive but not specific for the identification of lesions. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cerebrospinal fluid or serum may be diagnostically helpful. However, the diagnosis is generally made after surgical resection, which is usually curative. \nAn unusual complication of high dose infusion computerized tomography in a patient with a continent diversion. We describe a myelodysplastic woman with a Kock continent ileal reservoir who suffered parastomal herniation of the pouch following high dose infusion computerized tomography. Prophylactic indwelling catheterization in patients with continent diversion undergoing procedures that induce significant diuresis or involve prolonged distension of the reservoir is probably indicated. \nAnalysis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia for the presence of human papillomavirus DNA. We have analyzed a number of invasive squamous cell carcinomas for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA using dot blot and Southern blot analysis. Seven of 31 samples (23%) were positive by dot blot and/or Southern blot analysis. In contrast, six of 11 (55%) of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias contained HPV DNA by dot blot and/or Southern blot hybridization. Less than 50% of the invasive vulvar carcinomas contained detectable HPV DNA. The average age at onset of vulvar carcinoma is higher than that for cervical carcinoma (in which HPV DNA is detected in over 80% of cases). Therefore, the role of HPV in the genesis of vulvar carcinoma may be different from the role of HPV in the genesis of cervical carcinoma. \nFamilial nemaline myopathy: case reports. Two siblings of two generations in the same family with nemaline myopathy are described. The disease affects all skeletal muscles, especially the facial muscles, producing a typical facial appearance. The diagnosis was made by light microscopy of histologically stained sections of muscle biopsy. The disease in our patients seems to be transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. The purpose of this article is to emphasize the importance of recognition of the facial appearance by maxillofacial surgeons and the appropriate referral of patients for further neurologic examination. \nFailure of motor evoked potentials to predict neurologic outcome in experimental thoracic aortic occlusion. Motor evoked potential monitoring was tested as an alternative to somatosensory evoked potential monitoring in evaluating spinal cord function during thoracic aortic occlusion in dogs. Twenty-seven animals underwent 60 minutes of cross-clamping of the proximal descending thoracic aorta with (n = 18) or without (n = 9) cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Spinal cord blood flow was measured with microspheres, and neurologic outcome was evaluated at 24 hours with Tarlov's scoring system. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage improved neurologic outcome (p less than 0.05). Motor evoked potentials recorded over the lumbar spinal cord were lost in 9 of 20 dogs with ischemic cord injury and were not lost in any of the 7 dogs that were neurologically normal. Somatosensory evoked potential were lost in 19 of 20 paraplegic/paraparetic dogs and lost in 3 of 7 normal dogs (p less than 0.01). After reperfusion, motor evoked potentials returned in all nine neurologically injured dogs that lost the potentials and were still present at 24 hours. Changes in amplitude, latency, or time until loss or return of motor evoked potentials or somatosensory evoked potentials did not predict neurologic injury. Loss of somatosensory evoked potentials had a high sensitivity (95%) but had low specificity (67%) because of peripheral nerve ischemia. Loss of motor evoked potentials recorded from the spinal cord had high specificity (100%) but a low sensitivity (46%) and was therefore not a reliable predictor of neurologic injury. Return of motor evoked potentials during reperfusion did not correlate with functional recovery. Motor evoked potentials stimulated in the cortex and recorded from the spinal cord had low overall accuracy (59%). \nSnoring and the risk of ischemic brain infarction. To determine if a history of snoring is a risk factor for brain infarction, I conducted a case-control study of risk factors for ischemic stroke using 177 consecutive male patients aged 16-60 (mean 49) years with acute brain infarction. For each patient I chose an age-matched (+/- 6 years) male control. Arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, snoring (habitually or often), and heavy drinking (greater than 300 g/wk) were risk factors in the stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio of snoring for brain infarction was 2.13. By McNemar's test this association increased strongly if a history of sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obesity were all present with snoring (odds ratio 8.00). My study indicates that snoring may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, possibly because of the higher prevalence of an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome among snorers than nonsnorers. \nMechanisms of disruption of the articular cartilage surface in inflammation. Neutrophil elastase increases availability of collagen type II epitopes for binding with antibody on the surface of articular cartilage. We recently observed that specific antibodies to type II collagen do not bind in appreciable amounts to the intact surface of articular cartilage, whereas antibodies to the minor collagen types V, VI, and IX do. These results suggest that the outermost cartilage surface layer prevented interaction of the antibodies with the major collagen type in articular cartilage. The present studies were designed to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms involved in the disruption of the cartilage surface layer in inflammatory arthritis. Articular cartilage obtained from rabbits undergoing acute antigen-induced arthritis of 72 h duration showed a significant increase in binding of anti-type II antibody to cartilage surfaces compared with normal control cartilage (P less than 0.01). Augmentation of anti-type II binding was also observed upon in vitro incubation of bovine articular slices or intact rabbit patellar cartilage for 1 h with human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), PMN lysates, or purified human PMN elastase. This increase was not inhibited by sodium azide, nor was it enhanced by incubation of cartilage with the strong oxidant hypochlorous acid. Chondrocyte-mediated matrix proteoglycan degradation in cartilage explants cultured in the presence of cytokines failed to increase antibody binding appreciably. The augmentation in antibody binding seen with PMN lysates was inhibited by the nonspecific serine-esterase inhibitor PMSF, but not by the divalent metal chelator EDTA. The elastase-specific inhibitor AAPVCMK also inhibited most of the PMN-induced increase in antibody binding, whereas the cathepsin G-specific inhibitor GLPCMK was much less effective. Incubation of intact cartilage with purified human PMN elastase indicated that this serine esterase could account for the increase in anti-type II collagen antibody binding to intact cartilage surfaces. These studies suggest that in an inflammatory response, PMN-derived elastase degrades the outer layer of articular cartilage, exposing epitopes on type II collagen. They also help clarify the pathogenic mechanisms involved in early articular cartilage damage in inflammatory joint diseases. \nDuplex sonography in splenomegaly. The aetiology of splenomegaly is seldom clear from either clinical or imaging assessment of the spleen. In the majority of cases sonographic assessment of the spleen produces a homogeneous enlargement of variable echodensity, but with very poor correlation with pathology. A study has been undertaken to assess the Doppler characteristics of the splenic artery in splenomegaly, excluding cases of portal hypertension in an attempt to provide further diagnostic information. Duplex assessment of 18 normal subjects and 10 patients with splenomegaly due to five different causes was undertaken. Analysis of waveform, peak frequency and pulsatility index were compared and failed to demonstrate any significant change. In the normal subject there is a broad systolic spectrum related to the tortuosity of the splenic artery, with persistence of forward flow throughout diastole, a reflection of the low peripheral resistance of the spleen. In splenomegaly the broad systolic spectrum is unchanged, since vessel tortuosity persists. Pathological and physiological assessment of the spleen in splenomegaly shows that a low resistance circulation persists, explaining maintenance of the diastolic flow pattern in splenomegaly. Increased blood flow to the spleen in splenomegaly occurs either as a result of an increase in vessel diameter or an increase in flow velocity, or a variable combination of the two which does not seem to be governed by specific pathology. An increase in peak frequency in some cases reflected some increase in flow velocity but provided no useful correlation. Analysis of the pulsatility index supported the above findings without adding further information. \nReflex anal dilatation: effect of parting the buttocks on anal function in normal subjects and patients with anorectal and spinal disease. Anal dilatation in response to gentle parting of the buttocks has been advocated as a sign of sexual abuse in children, but nothing is known of the physiology of this response or its existence in normal subjects, in patients with spinal disease, and in patients with a weak sphincter and whether it can be elicited after training. To answer these questions we investigated the effect of parting the buttocks on anal function. Combined anal manometry and electromyography was conducted in six normal subjects (five men, one woman, aged 19-53 years), in 18 patients with faecal incontinence (three men, 15 women, aged 30-80 years), and in seven paraplegic patients (six men, one woman, aged 25-36 years), in four of whom the posterior sacral roots had been cut. Parting the buttocks in normal subjects reduced the pressure in the anal canal from 102 (20) to 14 (3) cm H2O (mean (SEM), p less than 0.00001), but did not cause the anus to gape. This drop in pressure was associated with increased electrical activity in the external anal sphincter. Normal subjects could consciously relax the external anal sphincter and reduce the anal pressure but not so as to result in anal gaping during traction on the buttocks, even after anal dilatation. Stimulation of the anal lining by moving a probe in and out of the anal canal increased the activity of the external anal sphincter, raising anal pressures. Paraplegic patients who had lost conscious control of their external sphincters showed anal gaping when the buttocks were parted. \nMaple syrup urine disease in Mennonites. Evidence that the Y393N mutation in E1 alpha impedes assembly of the E1 component of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) in Mennonites is associated with homozygosity for a T to A transversion in the E1 alpha gene of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. This causes a tyrosine to asparagine substitution at position 393 (Y393N). To assess the functional significance of this missense mutation, we have carried out transfection studies using E1 alpha-deficient MSUD lymphoblasts (Lo) as a host. The level of E1 beta subunit is also greatly reduced in Lo cells. Efficient episomal expression in lymphoblasts was achieved using the EBO vector. The inserts employed were chimeric bovine-human cDNAs which encode mitochondrial import competent E1 alpha subunit precursors. Transfection with normal E1 alpha cDNA into Lo cells restored decarboxylation activity of intact cells. Western blotting showed that both E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits were markedly increased. Introduction of Y393N mutant E1 alpha cDNA failed to produce any measurable decarboxylation activity. Mutant E1 alpha subunit was expressed at a normal level, however, the E1 beta subunit was undetectable. These results provide the first evidence that Y393N mutation is the cause of MSUD. Moreover, this mutation impedes the assembly of E1 alpha with E1 beta into a stable alpha 2 beta 2 structure, resulting in the degradation of the free E1 beta subunit. \nIn vivo regulation of virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa associated with genetic rearrangement. A chronic pulmonary infection model was used to induce conversion to the mucoid phenotype by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO. At 6 months after initial inoculation, organisms isolated from infected lungs demonstrated the mucoid phenotype. Significant decreases (P less than .01) were seen in the levels of exotoxin A, exoenzyme S, phospholipase C, and pyochelin produced by the mucoid P. aeruginosa PAO rat lung isolates that returned to parental levels after reversion to the nonmucoid phenotype. In addition, lipopolysaccharide of the mucoid PAO lung isolates failed to react with serotype B-specific antibody in contrast to the original PAO and the revertant PAO organisms. Digestion of chromosomal DNA and hybridization with P. aeruginosa virulence factor-specific probes demonstrated that conversion to the mucoid phenotype was associated with rearrangement of chromosomal DNA upstream of the exotoxin A gene. Analysis of DNA from revertant organisms revealed hybridization patterns identical to the original PAO organism. \nDelay to invasive investigation and revascularisation for coronary heart disease in south west Thames region: a two tier system? OBJECTIVES--To assess the accessibility of invasive investigation and revascularisation procedures in the management of coronary heart disease in a defined population in the South West Thames region over 10 years, and to audit the performance of both the NHS and the private sector. DESIGN--Analysis of all patient referrals to the regional cardiothoracic centres for coronary heart disease during 1979-88. SETTING--North West Surrey District Health Authority, which had a mean catchment population of 205,000 during the study period. The health district is one of the 13 in the South West Thames region. PATIENTS--823 patients aged 34-80 years with suspected coronary heart disease, 204 of whom were referred for private investigation and 619 were referred within the NHS. The NHS referrals were mainly to St Thomas's Hospital during 1979-83 and to St George's Hospital during 1984-8. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Difference in time to investigation and intervention between the NHS and the private patients. RESULTS--After some variation in earlier years the mean (SD, range) waiting times from referral to cardiac catheterisation and then revascularisation increased progressively in NHS patients, to 115.8 (126.5, 22-482) days and 305.9 (164.4, 22-620) days respectively in 1988. There was no significant change over the 10 years in waiting times within the private sector, with a mean of 17.2 (18.2, 1-62) days to angiography and 22.8 (14.5, 2-152) days to surgery. Fifteen people on the NHS waiting list died of probable cardiac causes. No people on the private waiting list died. CONCLUSIONS--The performance of the NHS system in South West Thames region in response to emergency referral is adequate. The waiting time to routine investigation and revascularisation is prolonged and seems to be worsening despite increased investigative and surgical activity by the regional centre. The delays may subject NHS patients to unnecessary risk, which is not shared by private patients. \nPrevention of retrovirus infection after injury with contaminated instruments: an experimental study. Owing to similarities between human immunodeficiency virus and feline retroviruses, the feline model was chosen for the study to investigate the efficacy of timely topical treatment of accidental human immunodeficiency virus infection in the operating room. Cats were subcutaneously inoculated with either feline leukemia virus or feline immunodeficiency virus. An effort was made to neutralize the virus in loco either by infiltration of the inoculation site with povidone-iodine or with monoclonal antibodies, or by cauterization and excision. The animals were periodically monitored for feline leukemia virus antigens or for feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies. The results indicated that in the feline model, the development of generalized virus infection may be prevented by local measures if applied immediately. \nNuclear exercise testing and the management of coronary artery disease. Three hundred seventy-eight patients referred for nuclear exercise testing were classified using demographics and symptoms into low, intermediate, and high coronary disease likelihood categories. These likelihood groups constituted 15%, 41%, and 15% of referrals, respectively. Patients with prior infarction or disease at angiography (proven disease) made up the remaining 29% of patients. Only 2% of low likelihood patients had typical angina, but physicians diagnosed coronary disease in 64%, prescribed antianginal therapy in 50%, and were considering catheterization in 28% of these patients, all as frequently as for patients with intermediate or high likelihoods for disease. Patients with proven disease were treated differently in that 79% were receiving antianginal therapy and 56% were considered for catheterization (p less than 0.001). Nuclear exercise test results reduced the perceived need for catheterization in all groups, on average by 49%. Nuclear exercise tests are a standard by which patients are managed, sometimes substituting for the traditional role of the history in physician decision making. \nArteriovenous malformation in meningothelial meningioma: case report. An unusual association of a meningioma and an arteriovenous malformation is reported. A 68-year-old man developed left homonymous hemianopsia, left hemiparesis, and gaze palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a right occipital mass lesion containing multiple signal-void areas with tubular and honeycomb appearance, suggesting a marked vascular component. An angiogram showed abnormal vasculature in the mass supplied by the posterior cerebral artery and a dural arteriovenous malformation on the tentorium. Neuropathological examination after total removal of the mass revealed a meningothelial meningioma including major portions of an arteriovenous malformation that extended from the dura and leptomeninges, through the meningioma, and into the occipital lobe, where the tumor was located. \nRole of vasopressin in salt-induced hypertension in baroreceptor-denervated uninephrectomized rabbits. To elucidate the contributions of renal, humoral, and arterial baroreceptor reflex components to salt-induced hypertension, we administered 10% NaCl intravenously for 10 days to sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy (n = 7), sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with intact kidneys (n = 7), and sham-operated sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy (n = 7). Serial changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, and blood pressure variability were recorded. In sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy, MAP increased significantly from 109 +/- 2 to 124 +/- 3 mm Hg (day 4) and remained elevated for the rest of the experiment. This elevation of MAP was accompanied by a reduction in the standard deviation of MAP, with significant elevations in plasma vasopressin, norepinephrine, and atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations and in sodium retention. In the other groups, there were no significant changes in these vasoactive hormones. In the sham-operated sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy, sodium retention was similar to that of sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy. Continuous infusion (1 microgram/kg/hr) of a V1 antagonist prevented the elevation of blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine, the accumulation of sodium, and the reduction of blood pressure lability, whereas a bolus injection (10 micrograms/kg) on day 4 reduced blood pressure from 128 +/- 3 to 115 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). These results imply that vasopressin plays a crucial role in the expression of salt-induced hypertension in rabbits with compromised baroreceptor and renal function. \nGiant adult malignant sacrococcygeal teratoma. Successful treatment by combined abdominosacral resection. This report describes the successful removal of the largest adult sacrococcygeal teratoma (18.75 kg) the authors could find on record. The patient was 58 years of age. The tumor had been present at birth and had been biopsied at the time of her cesarean section 34 years earlier without further treatment. Special planning was necessary for moving and positioning the patient for operation to prevent injury due to the size and weight of the tumor. A combined abdominosacral resection with preliminary ligation of the internal iliac arteries and a diversionary colostomy were performed without difficulty or undue blood loss. The defect was closed primarily and drained. The tumor proved to be malignant on pathologic examination. \nUltrasonic decalcification of the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement. Aortic valve replacement for calcifica aortic stenosis requires meticulous debridement of the aortic annulus to effect optimal valve seating. Since 1987, we have used ultrasonic energy to debride the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement in 56 patients. In our experience, ultrasonic debridement of the annulus is superior to traditional methods of debridement, affords improved seating of the valve, and may allow placement of a larger valve. Our follow-up ranges from 2 to 32 months (mean follow-up, 13 +/- 9 months) with 0% incidence of paravalvular leak or valve failure. We advocate the use of ultrasonic debridement as an adjunctive tool in aortic valve replacement. \nUnilateral lumbar fusion. Unilateral fusion of the lumbar spine is rarely necessary or indicated. However, in patients with a \"far-out syndrome\" requiring decompression or in cases where unilateral posterior element resection is necessary for any reason, it may be both necessary and indicated. This unilateral destabilization effectively removes one leg of the tripod, rendering that intervertebral joint potentially unstable. The charts and radiographs of 13 patients (seven men, six women) with an average age of 60 years (range, 25 to 76) who underwent unilateral fusion were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up time ranged from 12 1/2 to 2 years with a median follow-up of 8 years. Eleven of the fusions were at one level, and two were at two levels. Seven patients had a far-out syndrome secondary to degenerative scoliosis; four were secondary to spondylolisthesis. Two patients had an osteoid osteoma involving a pedicle. A paraspinal approach was used in the majority of patients. Autologous bone graft was used in all patients. Unilateral pedicle screw fixation was used in the last patient in the series. The fusion rate was 85% (11/13). Three patients were smokers, two of whom developed pseudarthrosis. Disc space height did not appear to affect fusion rate. There was no progression of slip noted in any of the patients. One complication was noted in this group: a moderate postoperative infection, which cleared spontaneously. \nDouble compartment hydrocephalus in an adult. A case of double-compartment hydrocephalus in an adult is presented. Although this entity is infrequently noted in children, it is diagnosed even more rarely in the adult population. A discussion of the spectrum of abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics of the 4th ventricle and treatment options are presented. \nNeurophysiologic assessment of the anal sphincters. One hundred twenty consecutive patients with either fecal incontinence (60 patients), chronic constipation (41 patients), or idiopathic intractable pelvic pain (19 patients) were prospectively assessed. Patients underwent concentric needle electromyography (EMG), bilateral pudendal nerve terminal motor latency evaluation, anorectal manometry, and cinedefecography. The most common EMG finding in patients with fecal incontinence was decreased recruitment of motor units with squeezing and polyphasic motor unit potentials; these are consistent with an injury pattern. The most common EMG finding in the constipated patients was paradoxical puborectalis contraction. This latter abnormality was also a frequent finding in patients with rectal pain, as was prolongation of pudendal nerve latency. Paradoxical puborectalis contraction was diagnosed more frequently with EMG than with cinedefecography. Inter-examination correlation was best in the incontinent group between EMG and manometry. Cinedefecography had poor correlation with EMG in all patient groups but was valuable in the detection of additional pathology such as rectoanal intussusception and anterior rectocele. Electromyography including pudendal nerve terminal motor latency assessment is a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of disorders of evacuation. The information it yields is complementary to that offered by more routine physiologic examinations. \nCarpal tunnel syndrome: surgical treatment using the Paine retinaculatome. The operative technique for the relief of carpal tunnel syndrome has remained controversial. This report presents the results of 445 patients or 577 hands operated on using a transverse technique that varies little from that described by Paine and Polyzoidis. The patients were followed for 9 months to 3 years. In addition to the data received from follow-up visits, a questionnaire was sent to each patient for evaluation of their results. All surgery was performed under local anesthesia, sometimes with intravenous supplement. Of the 445 patients, 313 had unilateral operations and 132 had bilateral operations at one sitting. Postoperatively, normal hand function was achieved in 59.4% of patients in 1 week or less. Of the 577 hands operated on, 535 (92.7%) exhibited satisfactory results from surgery. No patient required postoperative physical therapy or splinting. There were no injuries to the median nerve or any of its branches. \nMotor responses after transcranial electrical stimulation of cerebral hemispheres with a degenerated pyramidal tract. Motor responses were evoked in the thenar muscles by transcranial electrical cortex stimulation in 5 stroke patients with an isolated lacuna in the internal capsule, in whom wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract was demonstrated in vivo. Suprathreshold stimulation of the affected hemisphere elicited bilateral motor responses; whereas, stimulation at identical intensities of the undamaged hemisphere yielded strictly unilateral responses in the contralateral hand, like the responses of all normal control subjects. Focused magnetic brain stimulation was performed in 1 patient and gave identical results. Because muscular excitability to cortical stimulation is preserved in spite of pyramidal tract disruption, other pathways must bypass the lesion. Because of the bilaterality of responses, we suggest polysynaptic corticoreticulospinal connections. \nTreatment of constitutional growth delay in prepubertal boys with a prolonged course of low dose oxandrolone. Forty six prepubertal boys who had constitutional growth delay were treated with oxandrolone. Mean age at the onset of treatment was 11.9 years (range 9.0-14.0) and bone age delay was 1.9 'years'. The dose of oxandrolone used was a mean of 0.05 mg/kg (range 0.03-0.18) for a mean of 0.9 years (range 0.2-3.6). Height velocity increased from a mean (SD) before treatment of 4.0 (1.0) to 7.5 (1.2) cm/year with oxandrolone. Growth rate was sustained at 7.6 (2.2) cm/year in the period after treatment. Those boys who attained a testicular volume of 4 ml or greater at the end of the treatment period had the most pronounced sustained growth acceleration. Height for bone age SD score did not alter significantly from a mean of -1.0 before treatment to -1.2 after treatment. Oxandrolone is a safe and effective treatment for prepubertal boys with constitutional growth delay. \nUse of duplex scanning in the diagnosis of arteria profunda femoris stenosis. To evaluate the accuracy of duplex scanning in diagnosing arteria profunda femoris stenoses in patients with concomitant superficial femoral artery occlusions, 123 femoral artery bifurcations were examined in 103 patients. Peak systolic and time-averaged maximal flow velocity parameters were measured in the arteria profunda femoris and compared with independently performed angiography. For detecting stenoses greater than 30% diameter reduction (50% by area) of the arteria profunda femoris, duplex scanning had a sensitivity of 91% and 96%, a specificity of 85% and 98%, a positive predictive value of 86% and 98%, and a negative predictive value of 91% and 96%, for a peak systolic velocity of 180 cm/sec and more, and for a time-averaged maximal velocity of 50 cm/sec and more in the arteria profunda femoris, respectively. The day-to-day variability for peak systolic and time-averaged maximal velocity parameters was low with correlation coefficients between velocity measurements on both days of 0.96 and 0.98 (n = 20), respectively. In 10 patients with arteria profunda femoris stenoses and superficial femoral artery occlusions, undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of arteria profunda femoris stenosis, the duplex scan revealed a reduction in stenotic peak systolic velocity from 330 +/- 84 to 163 +/- 50 cm/sec and a decrease in stenotic time-averaged maximal velocity from 156 +/- 47 to 54 +/- 17 cm/sec after the interventional procedure. These results show that peak systolic and time-averaged maximal velocities are accurate parameters to detect significant arteria profunda femoris stenosis in patients with superficial femoral artery occlusions. \nHemobilia due to vasculitis of the gall bladder in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease. A 30-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease presented with acute abdominal pain and signs of blood loss. At cholecystectomy she appeared to have lost a considerable amount of blood into the biliary tract due to bleeding of the gall bladder. Microscopic examination showed vasculitis of the gall bladder wall. Hemobilia has not been described before as a complication in mixed connective tissue disease. \nSouthern blot analysis in a case of Richter's syndrome. Evidence for a postrearrangement heavy chain gene deletion associated with the altered phenotype. Richter's syndrome (RS) can be defined as the emergence of an aggressive lymphoma in patients suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The authors performed immunophenotypic and Southern blot analysis of the peripheral blood and tissue specimen of a patient with RS. Using immunoperoxidase and immunogold-silver staining techniques and a panel of monoclonal antibodies, the authors found that the large cells characteristic of RS showed an altered immunophenotype as compared with the CLL cells and did not express mu heavy chain. Southern blot analysis revealed identical kappa light chain rearrangements in both tumoral cell populations consistent with a common clonal origin. Using the JH probe and several restriction enzymes, the authors also found evidence for a postrearrangement deletion of the heavy chain mu gene. These findings suggest that in this case of RS, a deletion of the heavy chain mu gene resulted in loss of mu expression by the larger cells that were characteristic of RS and was associated with their altered phenotype. \nArterial insufficiency in hemodialysis access procedures: correction by \"banding\" technique. Arterial insufficiency distal to an antecubital access is fortunately an infrequent but disturbing and often debilitating complication resulting in suboptimal access. During an 8 1/2-year period, 335 vascular access procedures were performed, 108 of which were antecubital brachiocephalic Gore-Tex conduits. Of these Gore-Tex conduits, 1.8% (2/108) had developed symptoms of vascular insufficiency 2 to 3 1/2 months after such access surgery. As previously published, arterial steal after the creation of an AV fistula could be corrected by the placement of an interposition Gore-Tex loop that would cure the problem and save the access. We have presented a procedure to correct a steal syndrome once a Gore-Tex conduit is already in place. Proximal banding and distal ligation with division of the cephalic vein below an end-to-side Gore-Tex loop is a simple surgical solution. It is not only curative but the procedure also maintains the existing Gore-Tex graft as a sustained avenue for access. \nClinical significance of the V-shaped space in the subluxed shoulder of hemiplegics. Recently, it has been proposed that shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia is accompanied by 1) the appearance of a V-shaped articular configuration occurring between the humeral head and glenoid fossa and 2) the presence of chronic pain. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of these statements. We evaluated 40 hemiplegic subjects over 3 months. Radiographs of the affected and nonaffected shoulders were taken at both a frontal plane (0 degree) and a 45 degree incidence. From these patients, subluxed (n = 19) and nonsubluxed (n = 21) groups were formed. Pain was evaluated using the Present Pain Intensity index of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. On these x-ray films, measurements were taken of the V-shaped space, abduction of the arm, and rotation of the scapula. The statistical analysis (analysis of variance for repeated measures) contrasted the results obtained from the nonaffected side with those from the affected side over the 3 months studied. At the 45 degree angle, which better exposes the articular configuration of the shoulder, the difference in the V angle between the affected and nonaffected shoulders was significant for the subluxed group (p less than 0.01), indicating that such a V-shaped space can be identified. The measures taken also indicate that a downward subluxation of the humeral head occurs relative to the scapula without any systematic abduction of the humerus or downward rotation of the scapula. None of the results obtained from the frontal plane x-ray films was significant. Finally, no significant relation was found between subluxation and shoulder pain. \nTelangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma of the extremities. Results in 17 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seventeen patients with telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma (TOS) of the extremities were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, according to two different protocols. Preoperatively, the patients received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cisplatinum (CPD) (HD-MTX/CPD) and doxorubicin. CPD was delivered intraarterially, the other drugs intravenously. Limb-salvage surgery was performed in 12 instances, and five patients were treated with amputation. Postoperative chemotherapy was tailored according to the grade of chemotherapy-induced necrosis. In 13 cases (86%), the resultant grade of necrosis was greater than 90% (good responders). The mean follow-up interval was 3.5 years with a range of 18 to 78 months. Fourteen patients (82%) remained continuously disease-free, while three patients developed lung metastases. Two of these died because of uncontrolled disease, whereas the third patient is alive and disease-free after metastasectomy. No local recurrences were observed. These results are better than those observed in 215 contemporary cases of conventional osteosarcoma treated with the same protocols. This study confirms that TOS is not a uniformly lethal tumor as suggested by prior reports. By employing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a high percentage of patients with TOS can be cured, and in most of them, a limb-sparing surgery is possible and safe. \nHigh-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate versus estramustine in therapy-resistant prostatic cancer: a randomised study. A series of 105 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, having progressed on first-line hormonal treatment, were randomised to high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 1000 mg i.m. daily for 15 days, followed by 1000 mg weekly (53 patients), or to estramustine 280 mg per os twice daily (52 patients). The treatment was discontinued because of side effects in 3 of 51 evaluable MPA-treated patients and in 8 of 51 evaluable estramustine-treated patients. Progression-free survival was short in both groups and no statistically significant difference between them was observed. After 1 year, 70% of the patients had died and there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatments in the cumulat",
