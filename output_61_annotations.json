        "text": "xtent, suggesting that factors beyond high blood pressure are important in the genesis of atherosclerotic disease in hypertensive patients. It is evident, for example, that patients with hypertension have an exaggerated vulnerability to the consequences of lipid abnormalities. Moreover, it has recently been established that hypertension is characterized by insulin resistance and altered glucose tolerance. As a result, high plasma concentrations of insulin produce proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle and connective tissue, and they may adversely affect the lipid profile. The left ventricle is also involved in hypertension--independent of blood pressure. There is growing evidence that there are increases in the muscle mass of the left ventricle and changes in its diastolic filling characteristics at the very early stages of hypertension. The arterial circulation is similarly involved, for alterations in structure or function, reflected by diminished arterial compliance, can be demonstrated prior to the appearance of clinical hypertension. Treatment designed to protect hypertensive patients from cardiovascular events must not only be based on blood pressure, but must take into account all the components of the hypertension syndrome. \nIdioventricular rhythm: hypervagotonia associated with placebo. We report a case of hypervagotonia manifested by idioventricular rhythm in a healthy, athletic man who participated in a Phase I study of an investigational calcium-channel blocker. Upon breaking the study's double-blind study code, it was discovered that the subject had received placebo. We discuss this unusual finding and the implications of including athletic subjects in safety/tolerance studies. \nCharacteristics of experimental Candida albicans infection of the central nervous system in rabbits. Different concentrations (10(7), 10(5), 10(3) cfu/ml) of Candida albicans were injected intracisternally in rabbits. The highest inoculum was fatal within 14 h in all animals. In recipients of 10(5) and 10(3) cfu/ml inocula, the mean +/- SD peak cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) concentrations were 1.6 +/- 2.42 and 0.3 +/- 0.59 ng/ml, respectively, at 6 h; the mean +/- SD CSF leukocyte and protein concentrations were 6291 +/- 6515 and 453 +/- 674 cells/mm3 (at 24 h) and 118 +/- 90 and 109 +/- 122 mg/dl (at 12 and 24 h), respectively. At 6-10 days after inoculation, a second peak of TNF alpha activity was accompanied by increased CSF inflammation. Mortality in the 10(5) and 10(3) cfu/ml inoculum groups was 56% and 22%, respectively. Fatal infection was associated with higher second CSF peak TNF alpha and leukocyte concentrations and a larger proportion of culture-positive CSF samples. Histopathology revealed hyphal invasion, vasculitis, abscesses, and acute and chronic inflammatory infiltration of meninges and brain parenchyma. This model can be useful for evaluation of the pathogenesis and therapy of central nervous system fungal infections. \nRelationship of HBsAg subtypes with HBeAg/anti-HBe status and chronic liver disease. Part II: Evaluation of epidemiological factors and suspected risk factors of liver dysfunction. In this study, we examined a possibility that epidemiological factors or suspected risk factors of liver dysfunction could account for the different HBeAg/anti-HBe status or the different prevalence of liver dysfunction between the adr and adw carriers. A total of 428 HBsAg carriers were surveyed of their age, sex, racial background, socioeconomic status, place of residence, birthplace, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, and history of blood transfusion as epidemiological factors or suspected risk factors of liver dysfunction. Adjustment for those variables using multivariate analyses did not substantially affect the association of the HBsAg subtypes with either prevalence of liver dysfunction or HBeAg/anti-HBe status. HBsAg subtypes seem to directly affect HBeAg/anti-HBe status and consequently influence development of chronic liver disease. \nInnovative approach in the diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri using carbon-11-L-methionine positron emission tomography. A case of gliomatosis cerebri was studied with positron emission tomography (PET). Carbon-11-L-methionine (11C-Met) accumulated in the diffusely infiltrative tumorous area more widely and accurately than the lesion detected by conventional x-ray computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Autopsy findings three months after the time of the PET study showed good anatomical correspondence between the extent of densely aggregated tumor cells and the region with high uptake of 11C-Met. PET may offer an innovative approach in the delineation of gliomatosis cerebri, which has not been clearly recognized by CT or MR. \nTransesophageal echocardiography: detection of an acquired left ventricular-right atrial shunt. Communication between the left ventricle and right atrium has a reported prevalence of less than 1%. Acquired left ventricular--right atrial shunt is caused by chest trauma or valvular surgery. A case of acquired left ventricular--right atrial shunt after aortic valve surgery is reported. The detection was possible by use of echo-Doppler, color flow imaging, and transesophageal echocardiography. Combined use of these modalities and multiple transducer positions when transthoracic echocardiography is used are recommended to make the diagnosis. \nNeurohumoral and metabolic effects of short-term dietary NaCl restriction in men. Relationship to salt-sensitivity status Published observations suggest that not everyone benefits from severe dietary NaCl restriction, since blood pressure responses appear heterogeneous and adverse metabolic effects may occur. We studied the cardiovascular, neurohumoral, and metabolic effects of 7 day periods of 20 v 200 mEq/day NaCl diets in 27 men. Twelve subjects were salt sensitive (SS), defined as mean intraarterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg) during high NaCl greater than or equal to 5% above MAP on low NaCl. Eleven subjects were salt resistant (SR), defined as MAP during the low NaCl phase greater than or equal to MAP during the high NaCl phase. The SR subset had a tendency to greater neurohumoral activity, assessed by changes in mean values for plasma norepinephrine (NE, P = .12) and plasma renin activity (PRA, P less than .001) on the low v high NaCl diet. In SR subjects the low v high NaCl diet also raised mean values for creatinine (P = .03), uric acid (P = .001), and low density cholesterol (LDL-C, P = .03), but not fasting insulin (P = .15). In SS subjects, the low v high NaCl diet did not raise NE (P = .35), although the PRA was greater (P = .002). Among SS subjects, mean values for uric acid (P = .005) and insulin (P = .02) were greater during the low v high NaCl phase, while creatinine (P = .15) and LDL-C (P = .67) were not different. The data suggest that severe, short-term NaCl restriction can be undesirable, especially in SR subjects, since potentially adverse neurohumoral and metabolic changes are not counterbalanced by the benefits of a lower MAP. \nBilateral nephrectomy before transplantation: indications, surgical approach, morbidity and mortality. Forty patients with end-stage renal failure, who had undergone simultaneous bilateral native nephrectomy before a subsequent renal transplant operation, were reviewed with particular reference to the indications and surgical approach for bilateral nephrectomy and to the complications of the procedure. The main indications for bilateral nephrectomy are hypertension resistant to medical therapy, persistent symptomatic renal infection, severe renal protein loss and occasionally polycystic kidneys or bilateral renal tumours. In this consecutive series of 40 patients both kidneys were removed because of chronic pyelonephritis with reflux (n = 28), glomerulonephritis with reflux (n = 9) and uncontrolled hypertension (n = 3). Surgical morbidity was less in patients who had bilateral nephrectomy performed through bilateral vertical lumbotomy incisions. There was no surgical mortality. \nTentorial subdural hemorrhage in term newborns: ultrasonographic diagnosis and clinical correlates. Tentorial subdural hemorrhage with its supratentorial and infratentorial extensions were diagnosed by cranial ultrasonography and computed tomography in 9 term newborns. Vacuum extraction or forceps delivery was used in 6 patients. Abnormal neurologic manifestations developed after a period of normality in 8 patients. Increased intracranial pressure was the most common presentation. All patients had hemorrhage at the falcotentorial junction near the incisura; 5 also had hemorrhage around the tentorial leaflet. Posterior fossa retrocerebellar subdural hemorrhage developed in 5 patients and posterior interhemispheric subdural hemorrhage developed in 4. All 6 patients who received conservative treatment had normal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Of the other 3 patients upon whom suboccipital craniotomies were performed, only 1 had a normal outcome. Although it localized the tentorial subdural hemorrhage either at the incisura area or at the tentorial leaflet, ultrasonography failed to identify all patients with retrocerebellar or posterior interhemispheric subdural hemorrhage. Parturitional tentorial subdural hemorrhage may not be uncommon. Ultrasonography and computed tomography are complementary in the diagnosis. Surgical decompression of the posterior fossa subdural hematoma is necessary only in the presence of acute hydrocephalus or signs of brainstem compression. \nCardiac sources of embolism and cerebral infarction--clinical consequences and vascular concomitants: the Lausanne Stroke Registry. We studied clinical characteristics and coexisting causes of stroke in 305 patients admitted to a population-based primary care center with an initial ischemic stroke and a potential cardiac source of embolism (PCSE). Using systematic standardized cardiac, arterial, and cerebral investigations and the logistics of the prospective Lausanne Stroke Registry, we found that nonprogressive onset, hemianopia without hemiparesis or hemisensory disturbances, Wernicke's aphasia, ideomotor apraxia, involvement of specific territories (posterior division of middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, cerebellum, multiple territories), and a hemorrhagic component were associated with the presence of a PCSE, as compared with 1,006 initial ischemic stroke patients without PCSE. Although age and sex did not differ, the frequency of hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, elevated blood cholesterol, and deep hemispheric or brainstem infarcts was higher in the patients without a PCSE. Nearly one-fourth of the patients with a PCSE had a coexisting potential arterial cause of stroke (large artery greater than or equal to 50% stenosis or small-vessel disease). In the majority of patients with a PCSE (76.7%), cardioembolism was the most likely cause of stroke, although a direct source of embolism was uncommon (4.3%) and intracranial embolic occlusions were present in less than one-half of the patients who were angiographed. \nEffect of daily etidronate on the osteolysis of multiple myeloma. Progressive bone disease in multiple myeloma frequently leads to osteolysis, bone resorption, pathologic fractures, vertebral compression, and hypercalcemia. We conducted a double-blind study in 173 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients of etidronate disodium (EHDP), a diphosphonate compound that reduces bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclastic activity. The patients were randomly assigned to receive oral EHDP 5 mg/kg/d or placebo until death or discontinuation due to intolerance or refusal. The extent of vertebral deformity was measured by a vertebral index as well as height. The frequency of pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and bone pain was regularly assessed, as well as size and number of osteolytic lesions. All patients received melphalan and prednisone daily for 4 days every 4 weeks as the primary chemotherapy for their disease. Although the repeated measures analysis showed a significant height loss, there was no difference between treatment arms (P = .98). There was no significant difference in bone pain, episodes of hypercalcemia, or development of pathologic fractures. Patients on EHDP showed less deterioration in their vertebral index, but this difference only approached statistical significance (P = .07). We conclude that EHDP therapy used in this dosage schedule does not have a clinically significant impact in multiple myeloma. \nLung asbestos fiber content and mesothelioma cell type, site, and survival. All ascertainable cases of malignant mesothelioma in Australia were notified to a national surveillance program in the period January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1985. There were 854 cases obtained and 823 confirmed on clinical (77) or histologic (746) ground. Tumor site was known in 759 cases (685 pleural and 74 peritoneal). Lung fiber content analyses by light microscopy and analytic transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis were done on 226 cases in which postmortem material was available, using the method of Rogers. Cell type was determined by a five-member expert panel of pathologists appointed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. There was a statistically significant trend between lung fiber content (fibers/g dry lung) and cell type from epithelial (low fiber content) through mixed to sarcomatous (high fiber content). This trend was most apparent for total uncoated fibers (chi-square = 6.8, df = 1, P less than 0.01) and crocidolite (chi-square = 6.7, df = 1, P less than 0.01). Lung fiber content also was associated with tumor site; higher lung fiber content being associated with peritoneal tumors. This relationship was significant for all fiber content measures except chrysotile and was independent of the fiber content-cell type relationship (log-linear analysis). Survival from time of provisional diagnosis was significantly longer for epithelial (mean, 13 months; standard deviation [SD], 12.8) and mixed (mean, 10.2 months; SD, 8.7) types than sarcomatous cell types (mean, 5.8 months; SD, 6.5; P less than 0.0001, by analysis of variance on log10 survival time). Survival time was significantly greater for pleural tumors (mean, 11.4 months; SD, 13.4) than peritoneal tumors (mean, 8.6 months; SD, 12.5) (P less than 0.005, by Student's t test on log10 survival time). \nSclerotherapy of bleeding esophageal varices using a thrombogenic cocktail. The short- and long-term efficacy of a thrombogenic sclerosant (1% tetradecyl sulfate, thrombin, and cefazolin) was studied in 101 patients. The majority of patients had alcoholic cirrhosis with Child's C classification (84/101). Bleeding was controlled in 94 per cent of patients with the first sclerotherapy. In-hospital and early (within 6 weeks) mortality were 14 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. There was a strong correlation with hospital mortality and the severity of hepatic disease. Long-term follow-up in 70 patients (mean of 16 months) showed that survival correlated with compliance to follow-up sclerotherapy and abstention from further alcohol intake. Mortality in patients compliant with follow-up was 5 per cent (1/19), as compared with 24 per cent (12/51) in patients who were not compliant with follow-up sclerotherapy. The mortality in alcoholic cirrhotic patients who abstained from further alcoholic intake was 6 per cent (1/17), as compared with 23 per cent (10/44) in those who continued to abuse alcohol. No systemic thrombotic or allergic events related to the use of bovine thrombin were noted during a total of 349 sclerotherapy sessions. \nRegression of coronary atherosclerosis: an achievable goal? Review of results from recent clinical trials. During the past decade, large, placebo-controlled, randomized trials have demonstrated that the incidence of coronary events can be reduced by treating hyperlipidemia. In studies with angiographic end points, marked lowering of total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol with comparable increases in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol retards the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and favors regression. In the Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS), such therapy also prevented the appearance and worsening of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary bypass grafts. In the recently reported Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS), in which coronary lesions were measured quantitatively, treatment induced clear regression of coronary atherosclerosis and also markedly decreased coronary events. The beneficial effect on coronary lesions in these studies appears to be proportional to the degree of lipid lowering. In addition, new evidence suggests that aspirin and calcium antagonists might prevent the development of early coronary lesions. The identification and aggressive treatment of patients with high serum cholesterol levels can have a major impact on the development and evolution of coronary atherosclerosis. \nSimplified limbal incision for extraocular rectus muscle surgery. We describe a limbal incision for extraocular muscle surgery which involves only one incision to the conjunctival-Tenon's layer instead of the three separate incisions required in the standard limbal approach. Based on the 316 extraocular muscle operations in which we have used this one-snip procedure, we conclude that it is simpler and faster than the standard limbal incision, and that it provides good surgical exposure and probably less tissue damage. \nPrimary invasive vaginal carcinoma. A review of primary vaginal carcinoma treated at the Medical University of South Carolina from January 1970 through December 1989 included 76 squamous carcinomas, 12 adenocarcinomas, and 3 undifferentiated carcinomas. Staging was done according to the system of the International Federal of Gynecology and Obstetrics as modified by Perez et al. Stages I, II, III, and IV included 25, 39, 15, and 12 patients, respectively. Corrected 5-year survival rates were 73% for stage I, 39% for stage II, 38% for stage III, and 25% for stage IV. Sixteen percent of patients had received prior pelvic radiation. Invasive cervical cancer preceded vaginal cancer in 21% of patients. Detection of cancer was accomplished by routine cytologic testing in 17% of patients, palpation of an asymptomatic mass in 10% of patients, or palpation of a symptomatic mass in 72% of patients. Eighty-seven percent of patients were treated with radiation therapy. Survival curves of patients grouped by stage and other potential prognostic factors were compared. Lower stage (p less than 0.01), younger age (p less than 0.02), and no symptoms at detection (p less than 0.01) were statistically significant favorable prognostic factors. Histologic type, extent of vaginal involvement, vaginal location, prior radiation therapy, prior cervical cancer, and prior hysterectomy are factors that did not significantly affect survival. \nSolitary minute hepatocellular carcinoma. A study of 14 patients. Fourteen patients with clinical Stage I hepatocellular carcinoma (T1N0M0) were studied. All patients were asymptomatic, and their conditions were detected by alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serosurvey and/or ultrasonography (US) either in the natural population in the early years of the study or in the high-risk population in the later years of the study. Cirrhosis was present in all patients. Radical resection was performed in all patients. There were no operative deaths or hospital deaths in this series. The 5-year survival rate after resection was 100%. There were seven long-term survivors in this series (14.2 years (alive), 11.3 years (alive), 8.8 years (alive), 8.8 years, 7.9 years, 7.6 years (alive), and 7.2 years after resection). The authors discuss aspects concerning early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). \nBy how much does dietary salt reduction lower blood pressure? III--Analysis of data from trials of salt reduction [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Apr 20;302(6782):939] OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the reduction in blood pressure achieved in trials of dietary salt reduction is quantitatively consistent with estimates derived from blood pressure and sodium intake in different populations, and, if so, to estimate the impact of reducing dietary salt on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease. DESIGN--Analysis of the results of 68 crossover trials and 10 randomised controlled trials of dietary salt reduction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Comparison of observed reductions in systolic blood pressure for each trial with predicted values calculated from between population analysis. RESULTS--In the 45 trials in which salt reduction lasted four weeks or less the observed reductions in blood pressure were less than those predicted, with the difference between observed and predicted reductions being greatest in the trials of shortest duration. In the 33 trials lasting five weeks or longer the predicted reductions in individual trials closely matched a wide range of observed reductions. This applied for all age groups and for people with both high and normal levels of blood pressure. In people aged 50-59 years a reduction in daily sodium intake of 50 mmol (about 3 g of salt), attainable by moderate dietary salt reduction would, after a few weeks, lower systolic blood pressure by an average of 5 mm Hg, and by 7 mm Hg in those with high blood pressure (170 mm Hg); diastolic blood pressure would be lowered by about half as much. It is estimated that such a reduction in salt intake by a whole Western population would reduce the incidence of stroke by 22% and of ischaemic heart disease by 16% [corrected]. CONCLUSIONS--The results from the trials support the estimates from the observational data in the accompanying two papers. The effect of universal moderate dietary salt reduction on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease would be substantial--larger, indeed, than could be achieved by fully implementing recommended policy for treating high blood pressure with drugs. However, reduction also in the amount of salt added to processed foods would lower blood pressure by at least twice as much and prevent some 75,000 [corrected] deaths a year in Britain as well as much disability. \nTechnetium-99m-d,1-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) uptake and glutathione content in brain tumors Technetium-d, HMPAO SPECT was performed in 70 patients suffering from intracerebral tumors of various histologic types (glioma n = 30, meningioma n = 19, metastases n = 10, angioma n = 3, neuroma n = 2, lymphoma n = 2, neurocytoma n = 1, epidermoid n = 1, gliosis n = 1, cholesteatoma n = 1). Tumor classification was histologically verified in all subjects except in two cases with inoperable angiomas. SPECT was performed under resting state conditions with a dual-head rotating camera (SIEMENS ZLC 37) following intravenous injection of 18-25 mCi 99mTc-d, 1-HMPAO. Regional tracer deposit was expressed in terms of a cerebellar index (CBI). Significantly higher regional HMPAO uptake was found in meningiomas when compared with gliomas of different malignancy (ANOVA p less than 0.05). Within gliomas, regional uptake increased with malignancy (n.s.). In 23 patients, a total of 32 tumor specimens were obtained for histochemical analysis of glutathione (GSH) content using high-pressure liquid chromatography. A significant correlation (least square method, p less than 0.001) between CBIs and GSH values was found, supporting the hypothesis that GSH is the predominant factor for the conversion of the lipophilic complex to hydrophilic derivates. \nExercise but not methacholine differentiates asthma from chronic lung disease in children. Bronchial provocation challenges with exercise and methacholine were performed on the same day or within a short interval in 52 children with asthma, 22 with other types of chronic lung disease (including cystic fibrosis), and 19 control subjects with no evidence of chronic lung disease. There were no significant differences in the baseline lung function before the two types of challenge in the individual groups and differences between the patients with asthma and with chronic lung disease were minor. When the mean -2 SD of the methacholine response of the control group was taken as the lower limit of normal, 49/52 (94%) patients with asthma and 18/22 (82%) with chronic lung disease responded abnormally. In contrast, with the mean +2 SD of the exercise response of the control group as the upper limit of normal, 41/52 (79%) asthmatic patients responded but none of those with chronic lung disease. Thus the response to the two types of challenge helps to distinguish asthma from other types of chronic lung disease in children. \nThe value of the tumor marker CA 15-3 in diagnosing and monitoring breast cancer. A comparative study with carcinoembryonic antigen. To estimate the utility of the tumor-associated antigen CA 15-3 in the diagnosis of patients with breast cancer, this tumor marker was measured preoperatively in 1342 patients. This group included 509 patients with malignant disease (134 breast cancer patients and 375 patients with other malignancies not involving the breast) and 833 patients with benign surgical diseases (95 patients with fibroadenoma of the breast and 738 patients with other benign diseases). The results were compared with those obtained for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The CA 15-3 level was above normal (25 U/ml) in 31% of the patients with breast cancer, in 22% of patients with other malignancies, and in 9% of patients with benign diseases. The CEA level was elevated in 26% of patients with breast cancer (more than 3 ng/ml). There was a good correlation of CA 15-3 levels with the tumor stage of breast cancer. Both CA 15-3 and CEA also were determined in 671 patients who had received initial curative surgery of breast cancer and who regularly attended our follow-up clinic. The CA 15-3 was found to be more sensitive than CEA in detecting recurrences of breast cancer. In the postcare period, carcinoma recurred in 205 patients. Of these, 73% had CA 15-3 concentrations above 25 U/ml; only 50% had CEA values above 3 ng/ml (P less than 0.0001). Although neither CA 15-3 nor CEA were sensitive enough for the screening and diagnosis of early breast cancer, CA 15-3 was significantly better than CEA in the detection of breast cancer metastases. \nHuman papillomavirus type 16 nucleoprotein E7 is a tumor rejection antigen. It has been speculated that immunological mechanisms play an important role in the control of carcinomas associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), such as cervical cancers. We have now demonstrated that immunization of C3H/HeN mice by syngeneic nontumorigenic fibroblast-like cells that contain the transfected HPV-16 E7 gene conferred protection against transplanted cells from a HPV-16 E7-positive syngeneic tumor. This protection was HPV-16 E7-specific and was mediated by CD8+ lymphocytes, which presumably were cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These results indicate that tumor cells containing HPV-16 E7, either as a result of transfection, as in our studies, or naturally, as occurs in many human carcinomas, can induce a tumor-specific rejection response and serve as targets for such a response. The system described here provides an animal model to further study immune responses to HPV-associated malignancies and to test the efficacy of anti-HPV vaccines toward the therapy and prevention of such tumors. \nAttenuation of IL-2-induced multisystem organ edema by phalloidin and antamanide. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine with diverse effects, including the ability to stimulate lymphocyte differentiation into cells capable of lysing tumor. Its therapeutic efficacy is limited because of side effects such as breakdown of the microvascular barrier and edema. Control of the microvascular barrier is in part regulated by endothelial cell cytoskeletal contractile proteins. This study tests whether the cyclopeptides that maintain actin filament organization and distribution and reduce macromolecular flux across the endothelial cell junction in vitro would similarly maintain barrier tightness and prevent early edema produced by IL-2 in vivo. Anesthetized rats were treated at 30-min periods with intravenous saline (0.5 ml, n = 41), phalloidin (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), or antamanide, (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), starting 30 min before the 1-h infusion of 10(6) U of recombinant human IL-2 or saline. Six hours after the start of IL-2, there was edema in the saline/IL-2 group, as measured by increased wet-to-dry ratios (W/D) in the lungs, heart, and kidney. With saline/IL-2, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid contained an elevated protein concentration and higher plasma thromboxane levels compared with controls. The number of neutrophils sequestered in the lungs was more than twice that of saline controls. Phalloidin significantly attenuated edema in lung and reduced BAL protein leak. Antamanide treatment was as effective in limiting lung and heart edema, but, in contrast to phalloidin, antamanide prevented kidney edema and did not lead to an alteration in the liver W/D. Antamanide also prevented BAL fluid protein leak. \nAmenorrhoea in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease. Amenorrhoea is common in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease, but little is known about its causes or consequences. We investigated 12 young women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease and amenorrhoea and compared them with 11 healthy age matched controls studied in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. None of the patients had raised serum concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone suggesting primary gonadal failure, but the variance in serum concentrations of testosterone, oestradiol, prolactin, and luteinising hormone were significantly greater in chronic liver disease patients than control subjects (p less than 0.01). Seven of the 12 chronic liver disease patients had low serum luteinising hormone concentrations, and compared with controls these patients also had significantly reduced median values of oestradiol (64 pmol/l), testosterone (1.1 nmol/l), and follicle stimulating hormone, and were significantly underweight as assessed by skinfold thickness measurements (all comparisons p less than 0.025). In the group with chronic liver disease skinfold thickness was significantly correlated with serum luteinising hormone (p less than 0.02). The five patients with normal serum luteinising hormone had higher median values of both oestradiol (237 pmol/l) and testosterone (3.0 nmol/l) than the control subjects (oestradiol: 113 pmol/l, testosterone: 1.9 nmol/l) but were not more obese or hirsute. Amenorrhoea was unrelated to the duration or severity of liver disease. The metacarpal cortical bone area (an index of bone density) was inversely related to the duration of amenorrhoea (p less than 0.02). We conclude that amenorrhoea in women with non-alcoholic chronic liver disease arises from hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction and can occur at any stage. \nPostpericardiotomy and postmyocardial infarction syndrome presenting as noncardiac pulmonary edema. Three cases are reported that describe acute pulmonary edema as an early manifestation of a postpericardiotomy or postmyocardial infarction syndrome. Each of these cases occurred in the presence of good left ventricular function. The cases suggest this syndrome occurs in immunologically primed patients who have had prior cardiac injury resulting in readily available heart antibody. The first report followed an acute myocardial infarction that required a temporary pacemaker, and the two other cases occurred following coronary artery bypass surgery. Two of the patients had a history of distant myocardial or pericardial injury, and the third patient had an acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction two to three weeks before cardiac surgery. All three patients with pulmonary edema responded dramatically to corticosteroids, having been resistant to diuretic and pre-load and afterload reduction therapy, suggesting an autoimmune capillary injury process. Early recognition of such a syndrome is important since all three patients were successfully treated, and might otherwise have been confused with other causes of pulmonary edema. \nCost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy versus cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy vs. cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones, a model was constructed that projects charges and survival for both treatments. For a 45-year-old woman with one small stone, treatment with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy rather than cholecystectomy is projected to result in an average gain of only 3 days of life and an average increase in direct medical charges of $1729 over 5 years of follow-up. The resulting marginal cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy vs. cholecystectomy is $216,000 of extra charges per year of life gained with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is projected to be much more cost-effective for elderly than for young patients (10-20-fold difference), but considerably less cost-effective for multiple stones than a single stone (2-4-fold difference), and less cost-effective for women than men (twofold difference). Adjusting for effects of morbidity on quality of life, extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is projected to have slightly better quality-adjusted survival than cholecystectomy for the small subset of patients with one stone (by 8 to 43 days at 5 years) but not for young patients with multiple stones. It is concluded that decisions about appropriate use of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy should consider the effects of patient characteristics on clinical and economic outcomes. \nSolitary extramedullary plasmacytoma of the maxillary antrum and orbit presenting as acute bacterial orbital cellulitis. Orbital involvement by plasma cell tumours is rare. Orbital tumours do not generally present as an acute orbital inflammatory disease in adults, though tumours such as rhabdomyosarcoma may cause clinical signs similar to an acute orbital cellulitis in children. We describe a patient with bacterial orbital cellulitis and sinusitis who was found to have an extra-medullary plasmacytoma of the maxillary antrum and orbit and coexisting testicular seminoma. \nModified Rambo meatoplasty in translabyrinthine tumor removal. Spinal fluid otorrhea and otorhinorrhea are morbid complications that occur in up to 18% of patients after removal of translabyrinthine tumor. Both of these problems can be significantly reduced if, during the initial surgery, the posterior canal wall is taken down and the tympanic membrane and external auditory canal skin are removed for better exposure of the eustachian tube orifice. The external auditory meatus can then be sealed by a previously described modification of the Rambo procedure. This additional procedure adds about 20 minutes to the surgery and presents a small risk of retained squamous epithelium. Fifty consecutive patients were divided into two equal groups and studied retrospectively. In group I, the patients underwent a modified Rambo meatoplasty at the time of the removal of their translabyrinthine tumor, whereas patients in group II had the tympanic orifice of their eustachian tube obstructed through the facial recess. Review of the postoperative course of these fifty patients indicated that the addition of the modified Rambo meatoplasty was justified by the overall reduction in morbidity and expense it provided. \nRapid resolution of ST elevation and prediction of clinical outcome in patients undergoing thrombolysis with alteplase (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator): results of the Israeli Study of Early Intervention in Myocardial Infarction. Alteplase (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA)) was infused within four hours of onset of symptoms in 286 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Delayed coronary angiography was performed 72 hours after admission with coronary angioplasty if indicated. Electrocardiographic monitoring was continuous during the first hour of treatment. The sum of the ST segment elevations (sigma ST) was calculated on electrocardiograms recorded at entry and an hour later. ST elevations resolved rapidly within one hour of treatment in 189 patients and persisted in 97 patients. Rapid resolution of ST elevation correlated with angiographic coronary patency as determined by coronary angiography 72 hours after admission. The patients with rapid resolution of sigma ST had significantly smaller infarcts and a better clinical outcome than the patients with persistent ST elevation. sigma ST values at entry and one hour after treatment had no additional independent predictive value. Rapid resolution of ST elevations in patients undergoing thrombolysis with alteplase was associated with a significantly smaller release of creatine kinase, better preservation of left ventricular function, lower morbidity, and less short and long term mortality. Rapid resolution of sigma ST elevation is an efficient indicator of clinical outcome in groups of patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing thrombolysis with alteplase. \nCirrhosis of the liver. A regenerative process. The ancient story of Prometheus, chained to a rock for defying Zeus by stealing fire from Mount Olympus and subjected to daily tearing at his liver by an eagle, attests to the early recognition of the extraordinary regenerative capacity of the human liver. This process had remained an intriguing mystery over the millennia. In the last 20 years, following the pioneering work of Bucher (1) and Moolten et al (2), there has been an explosion of research that has clarified some of the mechanisms underlying the process of hepatic regeneration. Regeneration implies proliferation and regeneration. After the fetal and postnatal growth of the liver is completed, hepatocytes no longer proliferate actively, but they can proliferate in response to cell death or loss (3). Hepatocyte growth responses are of particular research interest because they occur in vivo and involve cells that are normally quiescent. Hepatic regeneration constitutes a highly regulated process that is best shown by the arrest of liver growth following a partial hepatectomy precisely at the moment the hepatic mass reaches the mass of the original intact liver (3). This suggests that hepatic regeneration after a partial hepatectomy is a strictly regulated nonautonomous growth process that is controlled by the same factors that are responsible for the determination and maintenance of hepatic mass in a normal individual. In response to a partial hepatectomy, hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and progress to DNA synthesis and replication but only in numbers sufficient to restore the hepatic mass. The regeneration response is both synchronized and universal in that it affects all intrahepatic cell lines, including nonparenchymal cells. \nRespective timing of maximal color Doppler jet areas and of peak velocity of jets in left-sided valvular lesions: clinical implications. Time intervals between the R wave of the electrocardiogram and maximal dimension of jet areas of color Doppler and the R wave of the electrocardiogram and peak velocity of valvular jets of continuous-wave Doppler were compared by use of paired and correlative studies for a group of 55 patients with a total of 71 left-sided lesions. Mean values of both time intervals, mean difference, and its standard error were equal to zero for stenoses. Time intervals of 71% for mitral stenosis and 52% for aortic stenosis did not differ by more than 0.01 second; correlation coefficients were 0.96 for mitral stenosis and 0.85 for aortic stenosis. For regurgitations, differences in mean values and a mean difference with a standard error were found but remained unsignificant. However, the percentage of differences in time intervals below or equal to 0.01 second decreased to 35 for aortic regurgitation and 13 for mitral regurgitation, which showed the widest 95% range of differences. Correlation coefficients were 0.84 for the aortic regurgitation and 0.33 for mitral regurgitation. Thus the close relationship of time intervals suggests that standardized timing of area measurements at peak velocity is feasible for stenoses and remains under consideration for aortic regurgitation. Timing of measurements should remain empiric for mitral regurgitation. \nShortcomings of current antihypertensive therapy. Effective antihypertensive agents have been available for the last four decades. Their use in the treatment of hypertension has resulted in a marked decline in hypertension-induced morbidity and mortality. There are, however, some notable shortcomings with the currently available antihypertensive therapies, including disappointing effects against coronary artery disease and the fact that, even with treatment, hypertensive patients still have considerably higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than matched normotensives. This may be due to insufficient lowering of the elevated arterial pressure in hypertensive patients. In theory, overtreatment may also constitute a risk, considering the J-curve phenomenon. Other factors which may play a role are the different pathophysiological mechanisms in stroke and myocardial infarction, the potentially negative metabolic effects induced by some antihypertensive drugs, the importance of cardiovascular hypertrophy (in particular, left ventricular hypertrophy), and the inability of some antihypertensive agents to reverse such changes. To rectify some of these shortcomings, a more effective antihypertensive therapy is required. Ideally, an antihypertensive agent should provide effective lowering of blood pressure, in most patients to normotensive levels, while being devoid of potentially negative metabolic effects. It should also induce reversal of the changes of cardiovascular hypertrophy and, if possible, limit tissue damage if and when a vascular complication occurs. \nDifferential detection of plasma hydroperoxides in sepsis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma lipid hydroperoxides may be a useful marker for sepsis. DESIGN: Exploratory, open-label study. SETTING: Critical care unit at a university medical center. PATIENTS: Twelve patients with sepsis syndrome requiring hemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery catheters. Seven patients were diagnosed with pulmonary infections and five patients had intra-abdominal infections. INTERVENTIONS: Fatty acid hydroperoxide was measured in the fresh arterial plasma (radial artery) and mixed venous plasma (pulmonary artery) from each patient. Hydroperoxide was determined using a sensitive assay based on activating the cyclooxygenase reaction of prostaglandin H synthase. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean difference between the amount of fatty acid hydroperoxide measured in the plasma draining involved regions (arterial plasma for pulmonary sepsis, mixed venous plasma for intra-abdominal sepsis) compared with the paired, uninvolved regions was 0.45 +/- 0.14 microM (mean +/- SEM; p less than .005). CONCLUSIONS: Increased lipid hydroperoxides in blood-draining septic foci are markers of oxyradical release associated with severe infection, although they are not specific for infectious conditions, being released also from nonseptic regions of surgical trauma. Assays for hydroperoxides may be useful when relatively free of other tissue trauma. \nEarly angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by hypotension. Emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed in 62 patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by hypotension. All patients were treated within 12 hours of the onset of chest pain. Angioplasty was completely successful (residual lesion less than or equal to 50%) in 48 patients, partially successful (patent vessel greater than 50% residual lesion) in four patients, and unsuccessful in 10 patients. Patients in whom angioplasty was successful had a hospital mortality rate of 19%; those in whom angioplasty was unsuccessful or only partially successful had hospital mortality rates of 60% and 50%, respectively, (p = 0.012). Patients with occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending vessel had the highest failure rate (42%) and the highest mortality rate (67%). Other univariate predictors of hospital mortality were older age and elevated end-diastolic pressure. Successful emergency angioplasty improves mortality in patients with acute infarction complicated by hypotension. \nHLA-DQA1 and -DQB1 alleles associated with genetic susceptibility to IDDM in a black population. Transracial analysis provides a method of distinguishing primary associations between insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and HLA class II alleles from those secondary to linkage disequilibrium. Blacks show DR-DQ relationships that are different from other races and are a useful group in which to investigate HLA-D region associations with IDDM. In this study, the frequencies of HLA-DQA1 and -DQB1 alleles in Afro-Caribbean IDDM and control subjects were compared. Alleles were identified with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing. The DQA1 allele A3 was positively associated with IDDM (relative risk [RR] = 25.3, corrected P [Pc] less than 7.0 x 10(-6). The DQB1 alleles DQw2 and DQw8 were also positively associated (RR = 4.7, Pc less than 6.5 x 10(-3) and RR = 12.3, Pc = 3.4 x 10(-3), respectively). The A1.2 and DQw6 alleles were negatively associated (RR = 0.16, Pc less than 3.5 x 10(-3) and RR = 0.15, Pc = 2.4 x 10(-2), respectively). These findings were compared to data from other races. The positive associations with A3 and DQw2 are consistent with all racial groups investigated. The negative association with DQw6 is present in all racial groups in which it is a common allele. These findings suggest that DQ alleles, and hence DQ molecules, may directly affect predisposition to IDDM. \nAutomatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: is early implantation cost-effective? The evaluation of survivors of sudden cardiac death with serial electrophysiologic studies involves a lengthy and expensive hospitalization, especially when an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is ultimately necessary. The cost efficacy of this conventional approach was therefore compared with direct implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator after the first electrophysiologic study. Thirty-two survivors of sudden death who had inducible ventricular tachycardia during their initial electrophysiologic study underwent serial drug trials. At discharge 12 (37%) were taking an antiarrhythmic drug found to prevent induction of ventricular tachycardia and 20 underwent cardioverter-defibrillator implantation after serial drug trials proved ineffective. The average length of hospitalization for this group that had undergone serial drug testing was 20.2 +/- 9.3 days at an average cost of $48,900 +/- $31,600. Seven survivors of sudden death had no inducible ventricular tachycardia during their initial electrophysiologic study and underwent direct cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Their average length of hospitalization was 12.6 +/- 6.2 days at an average cost of $40,400 +/- $8,300. It is concluded that automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation as an early intervention is not more costly and indeed may be cost-effective compared with therapy guided by serial electrophysiologic testing. As antitachycardia devices become more versatile, long lived and easier to implant, earlier implantation is likely to compare even more favorably with drug therapy. \nUse of parenteral medium-chain triglyceride emulsion for maintaining seizure control in a 5-year-old girl with intractable diarrhea. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are an important component of an enteral ketogenic diet for seizure control. Previously, it was difficult to maintain ketosis when parenteral (iv) nutrition therapy was necessary. The use of iv MCT in a 5-year-old girl with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who had diarrhea and dehydration is reported. Conventional 20% iv fat emulsion (long-chain triglycerides, LCT) and dextrose free hyperalimentation (HAL) in a 4:1 ketogenic ratio did not maintain adequate ketosis during bowel rest. Compassionate use of iv MCT (Clintec Nutrition) infused as a 70:30 MCT/LCT ratio plus HAL maintained moderate ketosis. Seizures were well controlled during the iv MCT regimen, which allowed normal daily functioning. Complications included abnormal liver function tests and severe iron deficiency anemia of unknown etiology. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels increased to 1717 mg/dl and 614 mg/dl, respectively, but decreased with a reduction of lipid infusion and use of an antihyperlipemic drug. Nutritional status was maintained. In this case, iv MCT proved to be a relatively safe and effective short-term method of continuing parenteral nutrition while maintaining ketosis for seizure control. \nLong-term effects of radiotherapy and bromocriptine treatment in patients with previous surgery for macroprolactinomas. The long-term effect of radiotherapy and bromocriptine treatment was retrospectively evaluated in 25 patients who had previously undergone transsphenoidal surgery for treatment of macroprolactinomas. Surgery had reduced the median serum prolactin (PRL) value from 613 micrograms/l, a reduction of 53%. Postoperative bromocriptine was administered to 21 of the 25 patients. In 14 of these patients, serum PRL values became normal or almost normal with medication. There were no radiological or ophthalmological signs of progressive tumor growth during bromocriptine treatment. Fourteen patients received postoperative radiotherapy. After withdrawal of bromocriptine in 13 of these patients an average of 7 years after radiotherapy, the median serum PRL value had further decreased by 95%. The PRL reduction was similar for all doses applied, 38 to 52 Gy. After withdrawal of bromocriptine in 8 patients not receiving radiotherapy an average of 7 years after operation, the median serum PRL level had further decreased by 75%. At follow-up, 18 additional instances of pituitary insufficiency had developed in the group receiving radiotherapy, compared with 8 cases of insufficiency in the group not receiving radiotherapy. Thus, because bromocriptine has a long-standing effect on prolactin secretion, and radiotherapy is associated with a notably high incidence of pituitary insufficiency, we propose that photon irradiation should be considered mainly for patients who are not candidates for surgical or medical treatment. \nMultiple, giant fibroadenoma. Multiple, giant fibroadenomas are histologic and clinical variants of \"juvenile\" or \"giant\" fibroadenomas. These tumors are rare and occur mainly in adolescent and young adult black females. The individual lesions are well encapsulated with a histologic pattern primarily of the \"juvenile\" type, although cases of the \"adult\" type have been reported. A high incidence of recurrence is noted upon local excision, although this may decrease as the patient becomes older. Management options include local excision with reconstruction, reduction mammoplasty, and simple mastectomy with reconstruction. A case is described of this condition with review of the literature. \nDevelopmental anterobasal temporal encephalocele and temporal lobe epilepsy. The authors describe the association between an antero-basal temporal lobe encephalocele and medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy in three patients treated successfully by surgery. Two men and one woman, aged 26 to 37 years (mean 31 years), had onset of complex automatism and generalized seizures in their second and fourth decades (mean age 22.7 years). They had been epileptic for 6 to 14 years (mean 8.3 years) before surgery. Preoperative electroencephalograms localized ictal epileptic activity to the left mesial temporal lobe in all cases, and neuropsychological testing revealed dominant temporal lobe dysfunction. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated an anteromedial basal temporal encephalocele extending into the pterygopalatine fossa through a bone defect at the base of the greater sphenoid wing in the region of the foramen rotundum and pterygoid process, a discrete center of embryonal chondrification. At surgery, the encephaloceles were found in front of the uncus, and an area of gliosis extended from the encephalocele to the amygdalohippocampal region. All patients have been seizure-free following anterior temporal resection and amygdalohippocampectomy including the encephalocele. These three cases delineate a condition of disordered embryogenesis wherein a developmental anterobasal temporal encephalocele acts as the substrate for temporal lobe epilepsy. This lesion may be diagnosed preoperatively with MR imaging and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of late-onset temporal lobe epilepsy. \nRole of interferons in the therapy of melanoma. A range of potent immunoregulatory molecules termed cytokines has become available for the therapy of human melanoma. Among the cytokines, the interferons (IFN) have been examined in great depth for the therapy of melanoma. IFN are able to modulate host effector cell function, including the tumor cytolytic function of lymphocytes and monocytes. IFN also have the capacity to regulate the distribution of circulating immunoregulatory (T) lymphocytes and the expression of tumor cell surface antigens, as well as class I and II products of the major histocompatibility locus. These activities of the IFN have led to their early application for treatment of human melanoma. The empirical evidence that IFN alpha exerts clinically significant anti-tumor effects against melanoma is reviewed, and evolving status of adjuvant trials of IFN alpha and gamma is noted. New indirect host-mediated anti-tumor activities that may potentially be manifest by IFN have yet to be fully harnessed. The opportunity to obtain meaningful anti-tumor activity in advanced disease or adjuvant settings, at dose ranges below those which are toxic (conventional maximal tolerable), are at hand. The U.S. cooperative groups [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), and South West Oncology Group (SWOG)] are studying IFN gamma in pursuit of this goal in advanced and adjuvant settings for melanoma and other tumors. The determination of the clinical role of IFN as biologic response modifiers demands equal commitment to the clinical assessment of immunobiologic mechanisms and anti-tumor effects. The immunologic assessment of IFN and a number of other cytokines is a major focus of the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. Regional delivery of cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) may be the most appropriate and least toxic approach, given their half-life. Regional therapy by the intralesional route has yielded enhanced activity for a range of biologics, including bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Intralymphatic therapy with methanol extraction residue of BCG (MER-BCG) has been tested, and trials are now in progress with IL-2 to assess the optimal dosage by this route. It is likely that the optimal role of IFN and other cytokines will be found in combination with one another, and with different biologic modalities such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, to allow expansion and heightened activity of the desired effector cell populations in the host. Enhanced host toxicities, as well as anti-tumor effects, may require that special attention be devoted to optimal sequence of administration to enhance the therapeutic index. \nEffectiveness of histopathological diagnoses in dysfunction of hepatic transplantation. Review of 146 histopathological studies from 53 transplants. In 47 patients who underwent 53 liver transplantations and immunosuppression with cyclosporine (cyclosporin A), methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and antithymocyte globulin, 146 histopathological studies were performed (138 biopsies, six hepatectomies, and two autopsies). The following microscopical diagnoses were made: 43 acute rejections (29.4%), six chronic rejections (4.1%), 18 liver blood perfusion changes (12.3%), 15 biliary changes (10.2%), 10 cases of functional cholestasis (6.8%), two drug reactions (1.3%), two hepatitis B virus recurrences (1.3%), 11 opportunistic viral infections (7.5%), 18 minimal changes (12.3%), two nonclassifiable changes (1.3%), and 19 plurietiological changes (13%). A histopathological diagnosis of acute rejection was made in 31 transplants (58.4%). In 22 (71%) of them, acute rejection was diagnosed with the protocol biopsy specimen that was obtained during the second posttransplant week. Leukocyte counts and serum bilirubin and enzyme levels were obtained on the same day that the hepatic biopsy specimens were taken. There was no significant statistical difference between the mean serum data that accompanied each histopathological diagnosis, allowing identification of a characteristic biochemical profile for the causes of graft dysfunction. We report a detailed description of the microscopical findings of each diagnosis and the following conclusions: (1) Acute rejection is the most frequent cause of hepatic dysfunction and has an early appearance during the posttransplant period. (2) Histopathological findings can identify the causes of the dysfunction. (3) There is no specific biochemical pattern to differentiate these causes. This may be due to the frequent combination of etiological factors in every dysfunction episode. \nMedical and surgical treatment of nonallergic asthma associated with gastroesophageal reflux Patients presenting to a chest clinic because of adult-onset wheezing with no history of allergy had a 90 percent prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux, even though reflux symptoms were mild or absent. Ninety patients were randomly assigned to receive cimetidine or an identical placebo or to undergo antireflux surgery. During a six-month period, all groups improved clinically; the cimetidine and surgical groups improved more than the placebo group. The intake of pulmonary medication decreased significantly in both cimetidine and surgical groups. Pulmonary function test results improved in the cimetidine- and surgically treated patients; improvement was not statistically significant. At long-term follow-up, the surgical group maintained clinical improvement and decreased pulmonary medication intake, whereas the placebo group worsened. We conclude that gastroesophageal reflux can play a significant role in some patients with nonallergic pulmonary disease and that its treatment can improve pulmonary symptoms and objective measurements of pulmonary function. \nLiver tumors in cirrhosis: experimental study with SPIO-enhanced MR imaging. The influence of cirrhosis on superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the liver was studied in 31 rats. Experimental models included carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis and liver engrafting of rhabdomyosarcoma S4T cells. Hepatic uptake of SPIO measured with relaxometry decreased dramatically with histologic grade, while splenic uptake increased; the same results were achieved by calculating K values. Imaging of 13 tumorous cirrhotic rats confirmed these results by showing a muted decrease in liver signal intensity on spin-echo images after injection of SPIO. Nevertheless, all intrahepatic tumors could be visualized, as confirmed by postmortem examination. On gradient-echo images, postinjection contrast between the tumor and the liver was not affected by cirrhosis. Thus, despite strong impairment of hepatic uptake in cirrhosis, the diagnostic efficacy of MR imaging with SPIO did not seem to be significantly affected. \nThe prognostic value of postoperative seizures following epilepsy surgery. Among 55 patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for refractory epilepsy, patients with seizures in the week following surgery had a poor long-term, seizure-free outcome compared with patients without seizures. Outcome for patients with single seizures or seizures restricted to the first postoperative day seemed favorable compared with patients with multiple or later seizures. Seizure type and similarity to preoperative events did not predict outcome. \nIntracoronary recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in unstable angina: a pilot angiographic study. The effectiveness of intracoronary (IC) recombinant thromboplastin activator (rt-PA) was prospectively evaluated in seven patients with unstable angina and complex angiographic lesions or intracoronary filling defects (ICFD). There were four men and three women, with a mean age of 60 years. Three patients had multivessel disease and all patients had rest angina; none had evolving myocardial infarction. All patients were pretreated with aspirin and were given heparin. IC rt-PA was infused at the rate of 1 mg/min to a total of 50 mg, and angiographic changes were observed every 15 minutes. At 50 minutes, angiographic improvement was seen in two patients (28%), one of whom had complete and one of whom had partial resolution of ICFD. In two patients (28%) there was no change in the lesion, and three patients (42%) had worsening of the lesion appearance. In two of the latter, paradoxical closure was observed at the end of the infusion, and was treated successfully with ad hoc emergency angioplasty. This pilot study suggests that IC rt-PA at the dosage used may have variable effects on complex coronary lesions associated with unstable angina, and this may be of relevance in further trials evaluating IC thrombolysis in unstable coronary ischemic syndromes. \nOptimal dose of neuroleptic in acute schizophrenia. A controlled study of the neuroleptic threshold and higher haloperidol dose. After individual determination of neuroleptic threshold (NT) doses of haloperidol, 106 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (Research Diagnostic Criteria) were treated openly at such doses (mean, 3.7 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for 2 weeks. Ten responding patients were discharged and unavailable for follow-up or refused subsequent randomization, and one non-responding patient refused randomization. The remaining 95 responding or nonresponding patients were then randomly assigned, double-blind, to a dosage of haloperidol two to 10 times higher (mean, 11.6 +/- 4.7 mg/d) or to a continuing NT dosage (mean, 3.4 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for another 2 weeks. Of the 58 patients exposed only to NT dosages of haloperidol, 72% clinically recovered within the 5-week trial. Higher dosages given to 47 patients did not lead to greater improvement in measures of psychosis, but did produce slightly greater declines in measures of hostility. Higher dosages did regularly lead to significant increases in distressing extrapyramidal side effects. \nOxygen-dependent lipid peroxidation during lung ischemia. The effect of alveolar oxygen tension on lung lipid peroxidation during lung ischemia was evaluated by using isolated rat lungs perfused with synthetic medium. After a 5-min equilibration period, global ischemia was produced by discontinuing perfusion while ventilation continued with gas mixtures containing 5% CO2 and a fixed oxygen concentration between 0 and 95%. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measurement of tissue thiobarbituric acid-reactive products and conjugated dienes. Control studies (no ischemia) showed no change in parameters of lipid peroxidation during 1 h of perfusion and ventilation with 20% or 95% O2. With 60 min of ischemia, there was increased lipid peroxidation which varied with oxygen content of the ventilating gas and was markedly inhibited by ventilation with N2. Perfusion with 5-, 8-, 11-, 14-eicosatetraynoic acid indicated that generation of eicosanoids during ischemia accounted for approximately 40-50% of lung lipid peroxide production. Changes of CO2 content of the ventilating gas (to alter tissue pH) or of perfusate glucose concentration had no effect on lipid peroxidation during ischemia, but perfusion at 8% of the normal flow rate prevented lipid peroxidation. Lung dry/wet weight measured after 3 min of reperfusion showed good correlation between lung fluid accumulation and lipid peroxidation. These results indicate that reperfusion is not necessary for lipid peroxidation with ischemic insult of the lung and provide evidence that elevated PO2 during ischemia accelerates the rate of tissue injury. \nSurgical treatment of limbic epilepsy associated with extrahippocampal lesions: the problem of dual pathology. The authors present their review of 178 patients who underwent en bloc temporal lobectomies as surgical treatment for intractable epilepsy. Hippocampal cell density was quantitatively analyzed and the histology of the anterior temporal lobe was reviewed. Fifty-four patients (30.3%) had evidence of extrahippocampal lesions in addition to neuronal cell loss within the hippocampus (the dual pathology group). The pattern of cell loss was analyzed in the remaining 124 cases (69.7%) with no extrahippocampal pathology, and compared with that of the dual pathology group and a control group of four nonepileptic patients. Hippocampal cell loss was found in almost all epileptic patients compared to the control group. Severe cell loss greater than 30% of control values was found in 88.7% of patients without extrahippocampal lesions, but in only 51.8% of patients with dual pathology. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). In the dual pathology group, lesions of different pathology had a significant relationship with the degree of hippocampal cell loss: all 12 patients with glioma had mild cell loss, whereas all 13 patients with heterotopia were associated with severe cell loss. Severity of hippocampal cell loss was also analyzed in relation to seizure history: a prior severe head injury was associated with severe cell loss. Other factors such as seizure duration, secondary generalization, or family history of seizures were not associated with hippocampal damage. Dual pathology may produce a combination of neocortical and temporolimbic epilepsies that warrants a precise definition of the true epileptogenic area prior to surgical treatment. \nCongenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear in children: a clinical and histopathological report. Forty-one children with congenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear seen from 1978 through 1989 are reviewed. The most common presentation was that of an asymptomatic white mass behind a normal intact tympanic membrane. Computed tomography (CT) scan was useful in documenting extension beyond the mesotympanum. Surgical removal was performed using an extended tympanotomy for lesions in the middle ear and tympanomastoidectomy for those that had extended into attic and mastoid air cells. Observation over an average 3.1-year period indicated that 80% of children were free of disease after initial surgery. Residual disease that required further surgery was present in 20%. The importance of early diagnosis of congenital cholesteatoma is strongly advocated. The prognosis is better when the cholesteatoma is confined to the anterosuperior quadrant of the middle ear. Seventeen patients in this study had such a lesion, and extended tympanotomy allowed removal of an encapsulated closed cholesteatoma with normal postoperative hearing and no residual cholesteatoma. The average age was 2.3 years. Temporal bone histopathological studies of three cases of congenital cholesteatoma demonstrate two distinct pathological types of congenital cholesteatoma. A \"closed\" keratotic cyst in the anterior mesotympanum, which is easily removed, and an \"open\" infiltrative type in which there is no containment of the keratotic debris and the cholesteatoma matrix is in direct continuity with middle ear mucosa. Surgical extirpation of the \"open\" type is difficult and more likely to be associated with residual disease. \nSexually transmitted papilloma viral infection in the male. VII. Is cancer of penis sexually transmitted? Four cases are reported of squamous cell carcinoma of the genital tract in males. The close association of HPV 16/18 with in situ squamous carcinoma affecting the penis is demonstrated. The first documented case of a primary penile squamous cell carcinoma with metastatic deposits yielding positive HPV 16/18 isolates as shown by in situ DNA hybridization again demonstrates a close association of this virus to malignancy in humans. The clinical implications of these findings strongly suggest that squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is a sexually transmitted disease. A thorough examination of both sexual partners is necessary when Bowenoid papulosis or penile carcinoma is present, since the female partner is at high risk for cervical neoplasia. \nHemi-Fontan operation in surgery for single ventricle: a preliminary report Mortality after Fontan operation is related to risk factors like ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary artery deformity, and young age (infancy). Preliminary procedures may improve Fontan results. The hemi-Fontan operation includes atriopulmonary anastomosis and correction of all anatomical risk factors, but an atriopulmonary patch directs superior vena caval flow into both pulmonary arteries and inferior vena caval flow into the ventricle, thus maintaining cardiac output (modified Glenn physiology). We performed 17 hemi-Fontan procedures in 16 patients, 14 primarily (median age, 9 months) and 3 for takedown of a Fontan operation. The 14 primary operations were for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (5), pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (4), and other (5). All patients had multiple risk factors. Extubation was at 18 hours (median), chest tube removal was at 3 days, and hospital discharge was at 8 days postoperatively. Important complications included subglottic stenosis, transient diaphragmatic paralysis, pulmonary artery stenosis and thrombosis requiring reoperation, and transient ventricular fibrillation. One patient required hemi-Fontan takedown, and this patient later (3 months postoperatively) became the only death. Fontan take-downs have had a high mortality rate. In 3 patients who tolerated Fontan operation poorly, converting Fontan to hemi-Fontan abruptly reversed the downhill course. For these patients, the operation was life-saving. Hemi-Fontan operation is safe and well-tolerated, even in infants, provides the advantages of modified Glenn physiology before Fontan operation, and may be especially useful for Fontan takedown after failed Fontan. \nA clinicopathological study of seven globes enucleated after primary radiation therapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid or ciliary body. Seven patients with malignant melanoma of the choroid or ciliary body were initially managed with radiation therapy, either teletherapy with proton or cobalt 60 external beam, or brachytherapy with the insertion of an episcleral plaque containing iodine 125, 60Co or gold 198. All seven globes subsequently were enucleated because of progressive growth of the tumours, total retinal detachment, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, or neovascular or angle-closure glaucoma. Six of the patients had severe visual loss at the time of enucleation. The effects of radiation therapy on the neoplasms and the mechanisms for the visual loss are discussed. \nNerve cell loss in the thalamus in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Serial sections through the thalamus from the fixed right cerebral hemispheres of 15 cases (5 Parkinson's disease, 5 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 5 controls) were used to obtain quantitative estimates of neuronal loss, neurofibrillary tangle formation and Lewy body inclusions within individual thalamic nuclei. Severe neuronal loss and tangle formation were evident in the anterodorsal nucleus from the AD cases. Nerve cell damage was also present in the centromedian nucleus but was not associated with tangle formation and occurred in all but 2 of the brains examined. It is likely that the anterodorsal neurons are damaged locally by the Alzheimer's disease process whereas the changes in the centromedian nucleus may be related to ageing. \nEffect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on the proliferation of leukemic cells from children with B-cell precursor-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL): studies of primary leukemic cells and BCP-ALL cell lines. The effect of recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF-alpha) on the primary leukemic blasts and leukemic cell lines derived from children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) was studied. The proliferation of leukemic cells from the bone marrow of 11 of 13 patients (seven at diagnosis, four in relapse) and from the 697 (BCP-ALL) cell line was significantly inhibited by rTNF-alpha at the lowest dose tested (0.1 ng/mL), as measured by 3H-TdR uptake. The degree of inhibition was variable, ranging from 17% to 78%. Furthermore, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed, with approximately 70% mean inhibition of DNA synthesis detected when cells from 12 of 13 patients were incubated with 100 ng/mL of rTNF-alpha for 3 days. In contrast, rTNF-alpha did not inhibit another BCP-ALL cell line (EU-1/ALL) established recently in our laboratory. Studies indicated that the TNF-alpha gene was expressed by the primary leukemic blasts of one TNF-resistant case in his third relapse and by EU-1 cells. Also, TNF-alpha protein was detected by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay in the supernatant of EU-1 cells; this is the first report of TNF production by a BCP-ALL cell lines. The production of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein was not detected in the 697 cell line and in the primary leukemic blasts from six patients (four at diagnosis, two in relapse) whose leukemic cells were inhibited by TNF. The partially purified TNF-alpha obtained from the EU-1 cell line also suppressed the proliferation of TNF-sensitive primary leukemic cells, and this inhibitory activity was abolished by an anti-TNF-alpha specific antibody. Our results demonstrate that TNF-alpha is an inhibitor of in vitro proliferation of BCP-ALL cells from most patients. The TNF-resistant leukemic cells from a few patients and the EU-1 cell line express TNF mRNA, suggesting that the induction of TNF gene expression is associated with the development of TNF resistance. \nLong-term results after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of patients after percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) treatment of congenital pulmonary valve stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. This study represents a case series with duration (mean +/- SD) of follow-up of 4.6 +/- 1.9 years. Forty-six patients with a median age of 4.6 years (range, 3 months to 56 years) had BPV at one academic institution between June 1981 and December 1986. Mean peak systolic pressure gradients from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery were as follows: before BPV, 70 +/- 36 mm Hg; immediately after BPV, 23 +/- 14 mm Hg; at intermediate follow-up by cardiac catheterization or Doppler echocardiography at less than 2 years after BPV, 23 +/- 16 mm Hg (n = 33); and at long-term follow-up by Doppler at more than 2 years after BPV, 20 +/- 13 mm Hg (n = 42). BPV acutely reduced the gradient to less than 36 mm Hg for 41 of 46 (89%) patients. Available gradients at long-term follow-up were less than 36 mm Hg for 36 of 42 (86%) patients without additional procedures. A patient age of less than 2 years at the initial BPV was a significant risk factor for gradients over 36 mm Hg at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. BPV provides long-term relief of pulmonary valvular obstruction in the majority of patients. Close follow-up of patients who require BPV at less than 2 years of age is warranted. \nPrimary fibromyalgia and the irritable bowel syndrome: different expressions of a common pathogenetic process. Primary fibromyalgia (PFM) and the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are both common conditions which account for 30% or more of referrals to rheumatology and gastroenterology clinics. An association between symptoms in PFM and IBS has been suggested but the frequency with which they coexist has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of each condition in groups of patients with PFM and IBS compared to normal and disease control populations. We studied four patient groups, 20 patients in each group, with PFM, IBS, inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and also 20 normal controls. Using strict diagnostic criteria, each group was assessed by two investigators for symptoms and signs of PFM and IBS. Sigmoidoscopy was performed when indicated. Results indicate that 70% (14/20) of the PFM patients had IBS and 65% (13/20) of the IBS patients had PFM. This compared with the control groups where 12% (7/60) and 10% (6/60) had PFM and IBS respectively. In conclusion, these results indicate that PFM and IBS frequently coexist. A common pathogenetic mechanism for both conditions is therefore suggested. \nDiagnostic value of Lipiodol injection in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. We encountered a case of small focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) of the liver. It was difficult to distinguish FNH from hepatocellular carcinoma by means of sonography, computed tomography (CT), and angiography. After the injection of Lipiodol, it accumulated densely on FNH, but was washed away after a short time, as observed on the follow-up CT. This progress was different from that in hepatocellular carcinoma. \nTumor necrosis factor-beta in the serum of adult T-cell leukemia with hypercalcemia. Serum tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta) from patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) was studied by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed in our laboratory using biotinylated monoclonal anti-TNF-beta and recombinant TNF-beta. Seven of eight patients with hypercalcemia showed elevation of serum TNF-beta. On the other hand, TNF-beta could not be detected by the ELISA in 28 patients without hypercalcemia. The lower detection limit in this assay was 100 pg/mL, corresponding to 500 pg/mL by the conventional method. In two patients serum TNF-beta level decreased after treatment in association with the level of serum calcium. Furthermore, immuno-staining using anti-TNF-beta and avidin-biotin complex showed the presence of cytoplasmic TNF-beta in not only human T-cell leukemia virus type I infected cell lines, but also freshly isolated cells from ATL patients with hypercalcemia. The actual biologic activity of TNF-beta in serum was confirmed by a conventional bioassay in a patient with hypercalcemia, and its cytotoxic activity was inhibited by the addition of anti-TNF-beta antibody in the assay. These results suggested that serum TNF-beta might be one of the factors contributing to the hypercalcemia, at least in patients with ATL. \nWarm ischemia induces alteration in lung immune cell functions. Warm ischemia is an important factor in early allograft dysfunction. To elucidate cellular events involved in such lung injury, we examined the effects of warm ischemia on the cytotoxic function of lymphocytes retrieved by bronchoalveolar lavage as compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes. Warm ischemia of the lung was induced in eight dogs by crossclamping left hilar structures for 1 hour. Bronchoalveolar cells from ischemia left and unaffected right lungs, as well as blood lymphocytes, were isolated before operation and 2 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days after operation. Lung and blood lymphocytes were assayed for natural killer and lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Warm ischemia resulted in a significant impairment of natural killer activity within 2 hours of reperfusion (49% of preoperative control cytolysis, p less than 0.01). There was a significant increase in natural killer activity in bronchoalveolar lavage mononuclear cells 72 hours after reperfusion injury (178.4% of preoperative value, p less than 0.01). Interestingly, these functional alterations were not paralleled with changes seen in the peripheral blood lymphocytes or the opposite nonaffected lungs, where the natural killer activity appeared significantly depressed at 72 hours. Similarly, lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was noted to be increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage from the ischemic lung (179.5%, p less than 0.01) but decreased in the bronchoalveolar lavage from the nonaffected lung and peripheral blood lymphocytes at 72 hours after injury. We conclude that warm ischemia is associated with a functional alteration of the local lung immune cells. Such alteration is not observed in cells from the opposite lung or peripheral blood. The observed increase in nonspecific cytotoxicity of bronchoalveolar lymphocytes can be causative in the early damage seen in poorly preserved lung allografts. \nIs hypertension an insulin-resistant state? Metabolic changes associated with hypertension and antihypertensive therapy. In this review, the relationship between hypertension and abnormal carbohydrate metabolism is explored. A review of the current literature reveals that people with hypertension are also likely to suffer from insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hyperinsulinemia. Likewise, hypertension is prevalent in obese and diabetic patients. Deficiency of insulin at the cellular level may be a common mechanism in the development of hypertension in patients with type I or type II diabetes mellitus. Essential hypertension appears to be an insulin-resistant state. Insulin resistance may engender hypertension by increasing peripheral vascular resistance as well as by increasing salt retention at the level of the kidney. Therefore effective antihypertensive therapy should include agents that do not adversely affect carbohydrate metabolic abnormalities. Commonly used antihypertensive agents, such as thiazide, thiazide-like diuretics, and beta-blockers, are associated with glucose intolerance and increased insulin resistance. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and peripheral alpha-blockers (such as prazosin and terazosin) do not adversely affect glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. In addition, alpha-blockers have a positive effect on the serum lipid profile. The entire multifactorial cardiac risk profile must be considered when choosing therapeutic agents for conditions that have an impact on cardiovascular disease. \nThe unstable ST segment early after thrombolysis for acute infarction and its usefulness as a marker of recurrent coronary occlusion. To investigate the incidence of early recurrent ST elevation after intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, 12-lead electrocardiograms were continuously monitored for 571 +/- 326 minutes in 31 patients presenting within 4 hours of symptom onset. The study group comprised 9 women and 22 men (mean age +/- standard deviation 53 +/- 12 years), with ST elevation (anterior in 15, inferior in 16) on the initial electrocardiogram, who were given either tissue plasminogen activator (22 patients) or streptokinase (9 patients). Angiography was performed in 30 of 31 patients at 7 to 10 days. Early (less than 3 hours) resolution of ST elevation occurred in 19 patients (61%) at a median of 94 minutes (interquartile range 57 to 113) after thrombolysis, whereas 12 (39%) had no or late (greater than 6 hours) resolution. Eleven of the 19 with early resolution (58%) had either transient (5 patients) or sustained (6 patients) recurrences of ST elevation. Recurrent ST elevation was equal to or more than the initial peak elevation in 9 of 11 patients, and greater than 75% of initial peak in 2. A total of 25 episodes of recurrent ST elevation were observed in the 11 patients (19 transient and 6 sustained episodes), of which 8 (32%) were silent. The proportion of silent episodes was similar for transient (35%) and sustained (33%) recurrences. All patients with sustained recurrent ST elevation had at least 1 preceding transient recurrence. The median duration of transient recurrent ST elevation was 43 minutes (28 to 63). \nManagement and long-term outcome of aortic dissection. All 163 patients admitted to one institution between 1975 and 1988 with aortic dissection were reviewed. Type I and type II patients received grafting of the ascending aorta, with an intraoperative mortality rate of 11%. For type III dissection, management was medical in 53 patients, while 19 required surgery for aortic rupture or expansion, with an intraoperative mortality rate of 11%. The 9- or 10-year survival rates were 29%, 46%, and 29% for types I, II, and III respectively. Of 135 patients with primary aortic dissection, 17 (13%) required subsequent aortic surgery. Cause of late death was other cardiovascular disease in 38%, rupture of another aortic segment in 18%, sudden death in 24%, and other medical conditions in 21%. Although operative therapy for types I and II dissections and reserving operation for selected type III dissections provides acceptable long-term survival, careful follow-up is necessary due to concurrent cardiovascular disease and residual aortic disease. \nHemangiomas and vascular malformations. Vascular lesions in the neonate and infant are categorized as hemangiomas or malformations. Although their appearances may be similar, the pathobiology, natural history, and prognosis of these lesions are different. Selected important syndromes that are characterized as hemangiomas and vascular malformations are discussed, and an update on what is new in treatment, including laser therapy, is presented. \n\"Angioglioma\" and the arteriovenous malformation-glioma association. The term \"angioglioma\" denotes a highly vascular glioma, most of which are low-grade lesions associated with a favorable prognosis. The authors encountered an example of this pathology, a cystic oligodendroglioma associated with prominent vasculature which both clinically and histologically mimicked an occult arteriovenous malformation (AVM). This case and reports of the association of AVM and glioma prompted a histological review of 1034 surgically resected AVM's, both angiographically occult and visible, among which no oligodendroglial or astrocytic forms of \"angioglioma\" were found. Eight cases were observed, however, wherein oligodendroglial cells were increased in number within or about the malformation. Two basic histological patterns of oligodendroglial cell excess were seen; one appeared to be malformative in nature with abnormal disposition of oligodendroglial cells being an integral part of the AVM, whereas in the other an apparent increase in cellularity seemed the result of chronic ischemia with condensation of white matter. It appeared that the areas of increased oligodendrocyte content seen in association with AVM are non-neoplastic lesions that exhibit two rather distinct histological patterns of differing origin. In an effort to determine the frequency of \"angioglioma,\" the authors examined Tissue Registry data for several glioma groups in which highly vascular examples are prone to occur. Tumors selected for study included 104 cerebellar-type (pilocytic) astrocytomas, 82 oligodendrogliomas, and 51 supratentorial pilocytic astrocytomas. Histological hypervascularity mimicking a vascular malformation (that is, an \"angioglioma\") was encountered in 5%, 4%, and 12% of the cases, respectively. Based upon clinical, radiological, and pathological reviews of these cases, as well as a careful review of the literature, it was concluded that 1) \"angiogliomas\" are neither rare nor represent a distinct clinicopathological entity; 2) in histological but not necessarily angiographic surgical terms, they represent simply highly vascular gliomas, usually of low grade; and 3) the clinicopathological and angiographic features as well as the prognosis of such lesions do not differ from those of similar gliomas without angioma-like vasculature. Finally, \"angiogliomas\" must not be confused with gliomas of high-grade malignancy which, due to neovascularity, may be highly vascular at angiography and at surgery. \nDifferential gene expression in the recovery from ischemic renal injury. Recovery from renal ischemia requires regeneration of damaged tubular epithelium. Previous studies have examined the expression of proto-oncogenes and growth factors after ischemia, but the response of genes coding for structural and functional genes has not been scrutinized. Rats were subjected to 40 minutes of renal artery occlusion and 60 minutes to 96 hours of reperfusion. Total RNA was isolated and mRNA for the structural protein actin, the enzymes superoxide dismutase and renin, the proto-oncogene c-fos, the nuclear protein histone H2b, and the putative marker for cell injury TRPM-2 was quantitated by Northern hybridization. Expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos was seen early but for only short duration. Histone gene expression was not markedly increased until 24 hours after ischemia, but remained increased for several days. Renin mRNA was undetectable one hour after ischemia, but was present in normal amounts at 24 and 48 hours. In contrast, superoxide dismutase mRNA was present in decreased amounts 24, 48, and 96 hours after ischemia. TRPM-2 gene expression was greatly increased 24 to 72 hours after ischemia and began decreasing at 96 hours. This selective sequence of gene expression or repression after renal ischemia might maximize the proliferative repair process. This information will be useful for designing therapies to further enhance recovery from acute renal injury. \nAsymptomatic celiac and superior mesenteric artery stenoses are more prevalent among patients with unsuspected renal artery stenoses. The prevalence of unsuspected renal artery stenosis among patients with peripheral vascular disease has been reported to be as high as 40%, but the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac and superior mesenteric artery stenoses in these patients is not known. The biplane aortograms of 205 male patients who were military veterans and had aneurysms or occlusive disease were independently reviewed, and medical records were studied to determine associated coronary disease, risk factors, and patient outcome. Fifty-six patients (27%) had a 50% or greater stenosis in the celiac or superior mesenteric artery, and seven patients (3.4%) had significant stenoses in both mesenteric arteries. Patients with celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were older (p = 0.002) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.029) than those without significant mesenteric stenoses. Fifty of the 205 patients had significant renal artery stenoses, and 20 had advanced (greater than 75% diameter loss) renal stenoses. Ten of the 20 patients (50%) with advanced renal stenoses had a concomitant celiac artery stenosis, compared to 40 of the 185 patients (22%) who did not have advanced renal stenoses (p = 0.011). In the present study asymptomatic celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were common among male veterans evaluated for peripheral vascular disease, but the prevalence of significant stenoses in both the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries was low. The prevalence of significant celiac stenosis was higher in patients with advanced (greater than 75%) renal artery stenoses who might be considered for prophylactic renal revascularization. Lateral aortography with evaluation of the celiac artery is always appropriate in these patients. \nDipyridamole thallium-201 scintigraphy as a preoperative screening test. A reexamination of its predictive potential. Study of Perioperative Ischemia Research Group BACKGROUND. We examined the value of dipyridamole thallium-201 (201Tl) scintigraphy as a preoperative screening test for perioperative myocardial ischemia and infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. We prospectively studied 60 patients undergoing elective vascular surgery. We performed 201Tl scintigraphy preoperatively and blinded all treating physicians to the results. Historical, clinical, laboratory, and physiological data were gathered throughout hospitalization. Myocardial ischemia was assessed during the intraoperative period using continuous 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and during the postoperative period using continuous two-lead ambulatory ECG. Adverse cardiac outcomes (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, severe ischemia, or congestive heart failure) were assessed daily throughout hospitalization. Twenty-two patients (37%) had defects that improved or reversed on delayed scintigrams (redistribution defects), 18 (30%) had persistent defects, and 20 (33%) had no defects on 201Tl scintigraphy. There was no association between redistribution defects and adverse cardiac outcomes: 54% (seven of 13) of adverse outcomes occurred in patients without redistribution defects, and the risk of an adverse outcome was not significantly increased in patients with redistribution defects (relative risk 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.6-3.9, p = 0.43). Consistent with these findings, there was also no association between redistribution defects and perioperative ischemia: 54% (19 of all 35) of perioperative ECG and TEE ischemic episodes and 58% (14 of 24) of severe ischemic episodes occurred in patients without redistribution defects. The sensitivity of 201Tl scintigraphy for perioperative ischemia and adverse outcomes ranged from 40% to 54%, specificity from 65% to 71%, positive predictive value from 27% to 47% and negative predictive value from 61% to 82%. CONCLUSIONS. These results differ from those of previous studies and suggest that the routine use of 201Tl scintigraphy for preoperative screening of patients undergoing vascular surgery may not be warranted. \nFrequency of the hypercalcemia-leukocytosis syndrome in oral malignancies. There have been a number of reports over the last 15 years of patients with cancer who develop both leukocytosis and hypercalcemia, particularly in patients with cancers of the oral cavity. In this study, the authors report the frequency of hypercalcemia and leukocytosis in 225 patients with oral malignancies. Ten patients (4.4%) had hypercalcemia, 11 patients (4.9%) had leukocytosis, and five (2.2%) had both hypercalcemia and leukocytosis. The occurrence of these two distinct paraneoplastic syndromes in the same patients was greater than could have been expected from chance alone (chi-square = 45.8, P less than 0.0001). This study demonstrates that although hypercalcemia and leukocytosis are relatively uncommon in oral cancers, when they do occur they are frequently associated. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first report in which the frequency of the association hypercalcemia and leukocytosis is studied in detail in large numbers of patients with oral cancer. \nPatients who leave a public hospital emergency department without being seen by a physician. Causes and consequences OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients who sought care at a public hospital emergency department and left without being seen by a physician needed immediate medical attention and whether they obtained care after leaving. DESIGN: Follow-up study of patients who left without being seen and of patients who waited to be seen by a physician. SETTING: A public hospital's emergency department in Torrance, Calif. PATIENTS: All patients who registered for care and left without being seen (n = 186) and a 20% random sample of patients who waited until they were seen (n = 211) in a 2-week period during spring 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At time of presentation: triage nurse urgency assessment, clinical acuity rating, and self-reported health status. At follow-up: hospitalization rates. RESULTS: Patients who left reported that they had waited 6.4 hours before leaving; those who stayed reported a 6.2-hour wait before being seen. There were no differences between those who left and those who stayed in chief complaint, triage nurse assessment, acuity ratings, or self-reported health status. Forty-six percent of those who left were judged to need immediate medical attention, and 29% needed care within 24 to 48 hours. Eleven percent of those who left were hospitalized within the next week, and three patients required emergency surgery. Nine percent of those who waited to be seen were hospitalized. Forty-nine percent of patients who left did not see a physician during the 1-week follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Overcrowding in this public hospital's emergency department restricts access to needed ambulatory medical care for the poor and uninsured. \nImmunogenicity of low-dose intradermal recombinant DNA hepatitis B vaccine. Low-dose intradermal vaccination with plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine has been shown to give high rates of seroconversion at greatly reduced vaccine cost. We report a study comparing two groups given lower doses (1.0 or 1.5 microgram) of recombinant-derived vaccine intradermally with a control group given the standard intramuscular dose. Of the 132 randomized medical students and hospital employees, 95 completed the study. Rates of seroconversion and peak antibody titers were comparable, though antibody rose more slowly and fell somewhat faster in the intradermal groups. Increasing the intradermal dose did not improve response. Most intradermal vaccinees (80%) developed small (average 2 to 3 mm) areas of local induration, which faded slowly. Low-dose intradermal vaccination with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine results in high rates of seroconversion (greater than 90% in each protocol) at a cost that will allow individual practitioners and program with limited budgets to offer vaccination. \nEvaluation of right ventricular early diastolic filling by cine nuclear magnetic resonance imaging in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Numerous studies have established abnormalities in systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A consistent feature of this disease is reduced diastolic function of the left ventricle, but little information is available regarding right ventricular function in this disease. Cine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging has been found to be effective for measuring right ventricular volumes and therefore was used to assess early diastolic filling of the right ventricle in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Right ventricular time-volume curves were obtained from cine NMR images in 10 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 8 normal subjects. Right ventricular volume was calculated with use of Simpson's algorithm at approximately 18 phases of the cardiac cycle and, from the curve, peak filling rate and filling fraction during the first third of diastole were determined. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peak filling rate tended to be less (176 +/- 46 vs. 305 +/- 50 ml/s, p less than 0.01) and filling fraction decreased (39.5 +/- 13.8 vs. 74.5 +/- 13.3%, p less than 0.01) in comparison with values in normal subjects. Thus, analysis of right ventricular time-volume curves obtained by using cine NMR imaging demonstrated diastolic dysfunction of the righ",
