        "text": "CCs) were high (greater than or equal to .90) for both knees for PT and APT at both angular velocities. No clinically meaningful differences were found between the Pearson correlation coefficients and the ICCs of the involved versus the uninvolved knee for any testing conditions. We concluded that isokinetic evaluation of torque, as measured by PT and APT in subjects with spastic hemiparesis, can yield reliable results in both extremities. \nThrombogenic microballoon for cerebral aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and carotid cavernous fistula occlusion. Preliminary technical note. A thrombogenic microballoon was developed to overcome the problems of cerebral aneurysm rupture during microballoon inflation and incomplete aneurysm obliteration by microballoons with subsequent fatal rupture. These complications occur in about 35% of reported series with current microballoon embolization techniques. The wall of the new thrombogenic microballoon allows 80% aneurysm occlusion by inflation, thus avoiding mechanical rupture, and at the same time it produces a blood clot in the space remaining between the microballoon and the aneurysm wall. This clot undergoes fibrosis with firm adherence of the microballoon to the aneurysm wall. Experimental evidence is presented to support these conclusions. This thrombogenic microballoon system is also applicable to carotid-cavernous fistulas and arteriovenous malformations. \nResternotomy in patients with valved conduits adherent to the sternum. Twenty-two patients with valved conduits adherent to the sternum underwent resternotomy. Mean age was 10 +/- 6 years, and mean conduit age was 4 +/- 4 years. Diagnoses were D-transposition (7), truncus arteriosus (7), univentricular heart (6), Taussig-Bing anomaly (1), and corrected transposition (1). The majority of patients (68%) had reoperation for outgrown or degenerated conduits. In 17 patients, the sternum was opened with a chisel. Two of these patients sustained conduit neointimal collapse from manipulation, and 3 had conduit tear requiring immediate cardiopulmonary bypass through the femoral vessels. In the last 5 patients, the sternum was opened above and below the conduit, and the inner table was chiseled and left attached to the conduit avoiding injury and undue conduit manipulation. Cardiopulmonary bypass and operation were carried out uneventfully. We believe that the recent technique described provides a safe alternative approach to valved conduits adherent to the sternum. \nDynamic QRS-complex and ST-segment monitoring in acute myocardial infarction during recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy. The TEAHAT Study Group. Changes of the QRS complex are the electrocardiographic expression of irreversible injury of the myocardium. In humans, the process of infarction occurs over several hours. A more rapid development of QRS changes has been reported in patients treated with thrombolytic agents. Patients with strongly suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI) included in a placebo-controlled trial of 100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) were monitored for 24 hours with continuous, on-line vectorcardiography. The magnitude of the QRS vector changes correlated with infarct size estimated by the maximal value of lactate dehydrogenase-1 (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001) as well as with left ventricular ejection fraction 30 days after randomization (r = 0.49, p less than 0.001). Treatment with intravenous rt-PA limited total QRS vector change but the QRS vector changes observed occurred more rapidly and reached a plateau 131 minutes earlier in patients treated with rt-PA than in those receiving placebo (p less than 0.01). A certain pattern of highly variable ST vector magnitude was identified and was associated with higher maximal lactate dehydrogenase-1 values (23 +/- 13 vs 14 +/- 10 mu kat/liter, p less than 0.001) and a tendency to higher 1-year mortality (24 vs 9%, p = 0.08) than in patients without this pattern. In patients with this pattern, rt-PA did not affect maximal lactate dehydrogenase-1, time to maximal creatine kinase and final magnitude of QRS vector change. \nPeripheral pulse pressure patterns in pregnancy hypertension. Maternal heart rate and pulse pressure patterns were examined in 30 hypertensive pregnant women using noninvasive methodology described previously. \"Narrow\" and \"wide\" pulse patterns were identified. Narrow cutaneous pulse pressure patterns, which are thought to be caused by vasoconstriction, were associated with lower birth weight infants (1870 +/- 983 versus 3225 +/- 838 g; P less than .001) and earlier deliveries (34.2 +/- 5.2 versus 37.9 +/- 2.8 weeks; P less than .05). The data suggest that these adjunctive maternal cardiovascular-system evaluation techniques may be useful in identifying patients at risk of adverse perinatal outcome by detecting vasospasm of the peripheral microcirculation. \nDetection of paradoxical cerebral echo contrast embolization by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Contrast echocardiography has been shown to be a sensitive method for detecting patent foramen ovale in embolic stroke, implying paradoxical embolization. However, not all two-dimensional echocardiographic studies are of diagnostic quality, and direct evidence for paradoxical cerebral embolization remains lacking. We addressed these problems by simultaneously using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and contrast echocardiography to compare relative sensitivity and concordance in the detection of right-to-left vascular shunting. Forty-six patients with stroke, transient neurologic defect, or question of atrial septal defect underwent study at rest and during Valsalva strain. Two-dimensional echocardiography detected shunting in 26% at rest and 15% during Valsalva strain, whereas transcranial Doppler study returned rates of 41% and 41%, respectively. Concordance was 82% and 75%, respectively. Discordant studies almost always had evidence of paradoxical contrast embolization by transcranial Doppler and intermediate findings by two-dimensional echocardiography. Transcranial Doppler is a sensitive, unambiguous technique for the detection of anatomic substrates and target organ involvement in patients suspected to have paradoxical cerebral embolization. \nEffect of intrathecal fibrinolytic therapy on clot lysis and vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. A prospective series of 30 patients with a single, angiographically verified aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was studied for the effect of intrathecal thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on outcome, angiographic vasospasm, and computerized tomography (CT) findings after surgery. The patients included fulfilled the following criteria: operation was performed by Day 3 after the hemorrhage, CT showed only blood in the basal cisterns, and the patient had a single aneurysm or multiple aneurysms that could be treated surgically at the same operation. The patients were divided into groups of 10, with patients receiving 3, 10, or 13 mg of rt-PA in a single intracisternal injection at the end of the operation. There were no differences between the treatment groups in overall outcome. One patient from the 3-mg rt-PA group developed a postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage, and one patient from the 10-mg rt-PA group had a postoperative epidural hematoma. There was one death in the 13-mg rt-PA group that was caused by inclusion of a segment of pericallosal artery in the clip. In all treatment groups a reduction was observed in the amount of blood seen on the postoperative CT scans compared to the preoperative CT scans. The reduction in SAH grade between the 10-mg and 13-mg rt-PA groups was significant (p less than 0.05). The difference in the severity of angiographic vasospasm between the 3-mg and 13-mg rt-PA groups was also significant (p less than 0.05). \nIntraoperative electron beam radiation therapy for retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma. From December 1981 to December 1989, 20 patients with primary or recurrent retroperitoneal sarcoma received 4000 to 5000 cGy of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in conjunction with surgical resection and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). Seventeen of 20 patients underwent complete (14 patients) or partial (3 patients) resection. Three patients had shown evidence of metastases after EBRT by the time of surgery. The 4-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival rates of the 17 patients undergoing resection were 81% and 64%, respectively. Twelve patients received IORT at the time of resection for microscopic disease (10 patients) or gross residual sarcoma (2 patients). Of the ten patients receiving IORT for microscopic tumor, one patient has died of local failure and peritoneal sarcomatosis and two patients have died of distant metastases only. The remaining seven patients are disease-free. One patient treated for gross residual sarcoma has experienced a local failure 1 year after IORT and is without disease 7 years after salvage chemotherapy. The other patient treated for gross residual sarcoma has died of local failure. Five patients did not receive IORT at the time of resection because of the extensive size of the tumor bed. Three of these patients are disease-free with one patient alive with lung metastases and one patient dying of hepatic metastases. Aggressive radiation and surgical procedures appear to provide satisfactory resectability and local control with acceptable tolerance. \nMeningioma: the role of a foreign body and irradiation in tumor formation. A case of meningioma is reported. At the age of 18 years, the patient had undergone insertion of a Torkildsen shunt through a posteroparietal burr hole for obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a tumor of the pineal region, of which no biopsy had been made. After the hydrocephalus was relieved, he underwent irradiation of the tumor. Thirty years later, he was treated for an intracranial meningioma wrapped around the shunt. The tumor followed the shunt in all of its intracranial course. Microscopy disclosed pieces of the shunt tube within the meningioma. The role of a foreign body and irradiation in the induction of meningiomas is discussed, and a comprehensive review of the literature is presented. \nQuantitation of the critically ischemic zone at risk during acute coronary occlusion using PET. Critical myocardial ischemia has been defined experimentally during acute coronary occlusion as flow reduction of 50% or more since cellular ATP depletion begins to occur beyond this flow reduction threshold, placing tissue at risk of cellular injury. To test the hypothesis that critically ischemic fractional left ventricular mass can be measured noninvasively with PET, nine dogs were imaged in a multi-slice positron camera using the perfusion tracer 13N-ammonia, while radiolabeled microspheres were injected into the left atrium during acute coronary occlusion. Images were processed using a 50% threshold and the size of the resulting perfusion defect was expressed as a fraction of total left ventricular image volume. The critically ischemic left ventricular fraction determined in vitro from the microsphere perfusion data, ranged from 5% to 30% of the total left ventricular weight and correlated closely with that determined noninvasively by PET with r = 0.94 (y = 1.05X - 2.0%). We conclude that the fraction of left ventricular myocardium rendered critically ischemic during acute coronary occlusion can be measured accurately and noninvasively in vivo using perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography. \nProgressive deterioration of auditory evoked potentials after excision of an acoustic neurinoma: case report. The authors report the case of a 17-year-old girl who underwent excision of bilateral neurinomas of the cerebellopontine angle. Although her auditory evoked potentials were well maintained during the operation, they deteriorated gradually and progressively for the following 2 months. This seemed to reflect degeneration of the cochlear nerve fibers initiated by operative manipulation in the cerebellopontine angle in a patient who had no hearing when she awoke from surgery. \nDiffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage is a syndrome consisting of hemoptysis, anemia, and air-space consolidation. The radiologic appearance is non-specific. Pulmonary hemorrhage may be due to a number of different causes. The differential diagnosis and the diagnostic approach are different in the immunologically intact host as compared with the immunocompromised host. This article reviews the main diagnostic considerations in diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. \nGonococcal endocarditis complicating pregnancy: a case report and literature review. The incidence of gonorrhea has decreased substantially in the past decade. Disseminated gonorrhea is more common in women than in men, although gonococcal endocarditis is more common in men. Disseminated gonorrhea is most commonly described in women during menses or pregnancy. Only two cases of gonococcal endocarditis during pregnancy have been reported in the literature since 1942. We report a patient who experienced sudden hemodynamic decompensation at 30 weeks' gestation, resulting in fetal death. Aortic valve replacement was performed, but extensive involvement of the aortic root made complete eradication of infection impossible and eventually resulted in maternal death. \nBiomechanical changes at the ankle joint after stroke. The resistance of the relaxed ankle to slow displacement over the joint movement range was measured on both sides of a group of hemiparetic stroke patients, in whom spasticity had been established for at least one year and who showed no clinical signs of contractures. The ankle joints of the age-matched normal subjects were flexible over most of the movement range, showing dramatically increasing stiffness only when the foot was dorsiflexed beyond 70 degrees, with a neutral range between 90-100 degrees, and a less dramatic increase in stiffness during plantarflexion. Hemiparetic patients showed identical curves to the normal subjects on the \"healthy\" side, ipsilateral to the causative cerebral lesion, but were significantly stiffer in dorsiflexion on the contralateral side, without change in the minimum stiffness range or during plantarflexion. Therefore significant changes in passive biomechanical properties occur at the affected ankle of hemiparetic subjects, predominantly as the result of a loss of compliance in the Achilles tendon, although an increase in the passive stiffness of the triceps surae may also occur. The contribution of these changes to the locomotor disability of hemiparetic patients is discussed. \nMultichannel cochlear implant and electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses in a child with labyrinthitis ossificans. Ossification of the cochlea following meningitis presents a surgical challenge. Electrode mapping, especially in the young child, is difficult given the uncertainty of electrode contact with viable neural elements. This paper reviews surgical technique and the use of auditory brainstem responses to map the electrodes. A 4-year-old child deafened by meningitis at age 20 months had bilateral cochlear ossification by computed tomography. At surgery, a canal wall-down mastoidectomy and closure of the ear canal were performed. A trough around the modiolus was drilled, and the electrode array was placed in it. Post-operatively, the patient gave aversive or no responses to electrode stimulation. To assess electrode function, auditory brainstem responses to individual electrode activation were obtained under general anesthesia. Functioning electrodes could thus be selected for mapping. The patient now responds well to sound. \nLeft ventricular diastolic collapse. An echocardiographic sign of regional cardiac tamponade. BACKGROUND. Cardiac tamponade after cardiac surgical procedures is often associated with hemodynamically significant localized pericardial effusions. The localized collection of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period and the atypical presentation of cardiac tamponade limit the use of conventional clinical and echocardiographic signs usually seen with a circumferential pericardial effusion. Observation of left ventricular diastolic collapse in the echocardiogram of a patient with postoperative regional cardiac tamponade prompted us to explore the frequency of this sign in regional cardiac tamponade. METHODS AND RESULTS. We retrospectively analyzed the echocardiograms of 18 patients with postoperative cardiac tamponade for the following echocardiographic findings: right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, left atrial collapse, and left ventricular diastolic collapse. Three of the 18 patients had circumferential pericardial effusion, and 15 had loculated pericardial effusion; in 10, the effusion was predominantly posterior, and in the other five, it extended laterally or inferiorly. The conventional echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade such as right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, and left atrial collapse were present in only 3, 1, and 3 of these 15 patients, respectively, but all exhibited left ventricular diastolic collapse. Increasing pressure within the compartment of a loculated pericardial effusion reaching the limit of pericardial distensibility and consequent transient reversal of transmural left ventricular pressure during diastole are most likely the basis for diastolic collapse of the thick-walled ventricle in a setting of regional cardiac tamponade. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that left ventricular diastolic collapse is a frequent sign of regional cardiac tamponade and could be a useful marker of tamponade in postoperative patients. \nPercutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of stenotic standard Blalock-Taussig shunts: effect on choice of initial palliation in cyanotic congenital heart disease. To date, attempted balloon dilation of stenotic standard Blalock-Taussig shunts has been largely disappointing. It has been suggested that this may be due to the use of balloons of insufficient diameter. Balloon dilation of stenotic Blalock-Taussig shunts was attempted with use of relatively large balloons in five patients (11 to 67 months old) with cyanotic heart disease who were becoming progressively cyanotic and polycythemic (hemoglobin 17.9 +/- 1.1 g/dl) because of discrete shunt stenosis at the site of pulmonary anastomosis. Balloon diameters selected were equal to or within 1 mm of the unobstructed proximal shunt diameter. Before balloon dilation the diameter at the site of the stenosis was 2.8 +/- 0.8 mm (range 1.7 to 4); after balloon dilation it was 5.7 +/- 1.1 mm (range 4.5 to 7.5). The diameter increased in all patients (range 2.0 to 3.5 mm); the mean increase was 2.8 +/- 0.2 mm (p less than 0.005). Expressed as a percent, the increase in diameter at the stenosis ranged from 80% to 182.4% (mean 108.2 +/- 16.8%). Before balloon dilation the systemic oxygen saturation was 72.8 +/- 9.2% (range 55% to 80%) and after balloon dilation it was 83.6 +/- 2.9% (range 80% to 87%). A satisfactory increase (range 6% to 25%) in blood oxygen saturation was seen in all patients; the mean increase was 10.8 +/- 3.2% (p less than 0.01). At follow-up, the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 85.8 +/- 2.9% (mean 5.8 +/- 1.7 months after balloon dilation) and the hemoglobin was 15.6 +/- 1.9 g/dl (mean 6.6 +/- 1.5 months after balloon dilation). \nAccess to neurological care for minorities. Minority groups comprise a major segment of the estimated more than 34 million Americans without insurance coverage and also the underinsured. Neurologic disease and neurologic complications of the major causes of morbidity and mortality affect minorities protracted by limited access to health care. Hypertension, a major cause of stroke in the black population, is just one example of the impact of accessibility to intervention in central nervous system disease. Health statistics note the persisting gap between minority groups and the nation's norms for life expectancy. Aging America and particularly black elderly women, combined with the lagging infant mortality among minority groups, demonstrate limited access issues beyond economics, reflecting inner city mores, cultural barriers, and communication delay limiting contact with the practicing neurologist. Awareness of such access limitations to neurological care for minorities demands the attention of the practicing neurologist and the neurological societies. \nCerebral infarction in young people. A study of 148 patients with early cerebral angiography. The aetiology of strokes was studied in a hospital based series of patients aged up to 40 years with precise clinical and radiological criteria. One hundred and forty five patients (75 males and 73 females) aged five to 40 years with cerebral ischaemia were evaluated. Aetiology was heterogeneous and could be classified into seven groups. Cerebral arteriograms were performed in all cases and indicated the aetiological diagnosis in most patients. Embolism was the most frequent recognised abnormality (38.4%). There were no complications of arteriography. Arterial dissections discovered by arteriography were the cause of the stroke in 10.1% of the patients. Atherosclerosis was diagnosed in 32 cases and was the commonest cause (21.6%). In one fifth of cases no cause was found. Contraceptive drugs were considered as potential cause of ischaemic stroke in 11.5%, cardiac diseases in 12.8% and haematological disorders in 8.1%. Other potential causes included migraine, inflammatory diseases, pregnancy and lacunas. Follow up in 126 cases showed that many patients had good functional recovery. \nArthrodesis of the knee with an intramedullary nail. The cases of twenty patients who had an arthrodesis in which an intramedullary nail was used for stabilization were reviewed at an average follow-up of six years. The predominant indications were infection after total knee arthroplasty and post-traumatic pain and instability. Other indications included aseptic loosening of the components of a total knee arthroplasty, reconstruction after resection of a giant-cell tumor, non-union of a fracture of the distal part of the femur or the proximal part of the tibia, and failed external-compression arthrodesis. Success was achieved in seventeen patients (85 per cent), and functional stability immediately postoperatively was gained in all twenty. Of the three patients in whom the arthrodesis failed, all had sustained an intraoperative fracture, and infection eventually developed. Of the twelve nails that were secured to the greater trochanter with a loop of stainless-steel wire, none showed evidence of proximal migration. Of the eight nails that were not thus secured, two migrated proximally, necessitating removal of the nail. Two drawbacks to this operation are the long duration and the large amount of blood that is lost. The major advantage is that a high percentage of patients have progression to a stable fusion despite serious problems. Furthermore, all but seven patients (including the six who had a tumor or who had sustained an intraoperative fracture) were able to bear full weight by the second postoperative week. Only a few patients needed an external support for walking. \nRole of thromboxane and serotonin as mediators in the development of spontaneous alterations in coronary blood flow and neointimal proliferation in canine models with chronic coronary artery stenoses and endothelial injury. Platelet-mediated obstruction of stenotic and endothelium-injured coronary arteries may be important in the abrupt progression from chronic stable to unstable coronary heart disease syndromes in patients. Transcardiac accumulation of thromboxane A2 and serotonin has been demonstrated in patients as chronic stable angina is converted to unstable angina. In this study in anesthetized open chest dogs with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury, thromboxane A2 and serotonin were shown to be important mediators of intermittent coronary obstruction caused by platelet aggregation and dynamic vasoconstriction. Furthermore, thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibitors and receptor antagonists and serotonin receptor antagonists, singly and together, provided substantial protection against repetitive platelet aggregation and dislodgment in canine models with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury even when systemic catecholamine concentrations were markedly elevated. These same observations apply in chronically instrumented, awake, unsedated dogs with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury in which recurrent platelet attachment and dislodgment cause cyclic flow alterations that may be prevented by thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibitors and receptor antagonists and serotonin receptor antagonists. Chronically instrumented dogs with coronary stenosis and endothelial injury in which recurrent platelet attachment and dislodgment occurred also developed neointimal proliferation of varying severity within 10 days to 3 weeks; the morphologic appearance of the neointimal proliferation was identical to that found in patients who develop restenosis after coronary angioplasty. \nSubstitution of leucine for isoleucine in a sequence highly conserved among retroviral envelope surface glycoproteins attenuates the lytic effect of the Friend murine leukemia virus. Friend murine leukemia virus is a replication-competent retrovirus that contains no oncogene and that exerts lytic and leukemogenic properties. Thus, newborn mice inoculated with Friend murine leukemia virus develop severe early hemolytic anemia before appearance of erythroleukemia. To identify the retroviral determinants regulating these effects, we used chimeric infectious constructions and site-directed point mutations between a virulent Friend murine leukemia virus strain and a naturally occurring variant attenuated in lytic and leukemogenic effects. We found that severe hemolytic anemia was always associated with higher numbers of blood reticulocytes with budding retroviral particles. Furthermore, a remarkably conservative leucine to isoleucine change in the extracellular SU component of the retroviral envelope was sufficient to attenuate this lytic effect. Also, this leucine at position 348 of the envelope precursor protein was located within the only stretch of five amino acids that is conserved in the extracellular SU component of all murine, feline, and primate type C and type D retroviral envelopes. This observation suggested an important structural function for this yet undescribed conserved sequence of the envelope. Lastly, we observed that lytic and leukemogenic effects were attenuated by a deletion of a second repeat in the transcriptional enhancer region of the viral long terminal repeats of the variant strain. \nMesonephric rest hyperplasia. A potential diagnostic pitfall. A case of mesonephric rest hyperplasia, an incidental finding in the hysterectomy specimen of a 48-year-old woman, was initially misdiagnosed as a well-differentiated cervical adenocarcinoma. We highlight the histologic, histochemical, and immunohistochemical features of this potential diagnostic pitfall and review the relevant literature. \nCoarctation: do we need to resect ductal tissue? A review of the literature as well as a retrospective review of 100 neonates undergoing operation for coarctation at Children's Hospital in Boston between 1972 and 1984 has not established clear superiority for either resection and end-to-end anastomosis or subclavian flap aortoplasty with respect to risk of recurrent coarctation. However, there is histological evidence that the juxtaductal coarctation shelf is composed of smooth muscle of ductal origin, which subsequently fibroses. This abnormal tissue may be at risk for late aneurysm development, particularly if balloon dilatation angioplasty is required. The fact that this abnormal tissue is not removed by the subclavian flap procedure is one of the inherent disadvantages of that procedure. Other disadvantages include the need to sacrifice the left subclavian artery and the fact that, unlike resection and end-to-end anastomosis, the subclavian flap procedure does not lend itself to augmentation of the hypoplastic distal aortic arch. Furthermore, occasionally a secondary coarctation membrane is present within the distal aortic arch, and though it is readily detected during the resection procedure, it can be missed with the subclavian flap procedure. Based on these considerations rather than on a demonstrated superiority of either procedure, my colleagues and I currently prefer resection and end-to-end anastomosis over subclavian flap aortoplasty. \nCircus movement atrial flutter in canine sterile pericarditis model. Activation patterns during entrainment and termination of single-loop reentry in vivo. BACKGROUND. Recently, we used a custom designed \"jacket\" electrode with 127 bipolar electrodes in a flexible nylon matrix to map the total atrial epicardial surface in the in situ canine heart. Atrial flutter in dogs with sterile pericarditis was shown to be due to a single wave front circulating around a combined functional/anatomic obstacle, with the arc of functional conduction block contiguous with one or more of the atrial vessels. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, this model was used to analyze the activation pattern during pacing-induced entrainment and termination of single reentrant loops in a syncytium without anatomically predetermined pathways. Sustained atrial flutter was induced in five dogs with 3-5-day-old sterile pericarditis. Atrial pacing at a cycle length 5-30 msec shorter than the spontaneous cycle length entrained the arrhythmia and could result in a \"classical\" activation pattern, characterized by an antidromic stimulated wave that collided with the reentrant orthodromic wave front of the previous beat at a constant site. However, two variations of this classical activation pattern were also observed: 1) Pacing at short cycle lengths could lead to localized conduction block in antidromic direction, forcing a change in the pathway of the antidromic wave front. This could prevent the expected shift of the site of collision in antidromic direction. 2) The stimulated orthodromic wave front could also use a pathway different from that of the original reentrant impulse, so that a different circuit was active during the pacing period. Termination of atrial flutter by rapid atrial stimulation was associated with progressive slowing and finally blocking of the paced orthodromic wave front and a progressive shift of the site of collision in antidromic direction. The occurrence of conduction block was determined by the cycle length of stimulation and the number of stimulated beats. A longer train at the critical cycle length or the critical number of beats at a shorter cycle length could reinduce the same reentrant circuit or a different reentrant circuit, respectively, during stimulated cycles following the beat that terminated reentry. CONCLUSIONS. The epicardial activation sequence during entrainment of reentrant arrhythmias does not necessarily follow a standard activation pattern. Instead, the stimulated orthodromic as well as the antidromic wave front might use a pathway different from that of the original reentrant wave front. The mechanisms of termination, failure of termination, and reinitiation of single-loop reentry are similar to those in the \"figure-eight\" reentrant circuit. \nThe use of nasal calcitonin in the treatment of post-traumatic algodystrophy. Calcitonin is widely used in the treatment of algodystrophy but a major disadvantage is the need for its parenteral administration. For this reason, we evaluated the effect of 400 iu of nasal calcitonin in the treatment of post-traumatic algodystrophy in a prospective randomized double-blind study. We found no demonstrable effect on the clinical or skeletal progression of the disorder using sensitive methods of measuring the response to treatment. There was, however, a small but significant hypocalcaemic response in the treatment group despite no change in the other indices of bone turnover. Possible reasons for this lack of clinical and skeletal effect are discussed. \nBlunt traumatic bladder rupture: the role of retrograde cystogram. STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the importance of microscopic and gross hematuria and the role of retrograde cystography and computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of blunt traumatic bladder rupture. DESIGN: All cases at a Level I trauma center between January 1, 1986, and March 31, 1989, were reviewed retrospectively. SETTING: Level I trauma center, university hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients with acute blunt abdominal trauma admitted to this Level I trauma center. INTERVENTIONS: The patients' charts were reviewed with emphasis on mode of diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had bladder rupture. All 21 had hematuria with more than 50 RBCs/high-power field, 17 gross and four microscopic. Twenty patients underwent retrograde cystography, which accurately identified bladder rupture, and one was found at laparotomy for other injuries. Seven patients had CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which failed to demonstrate bladder rupture. There were no associated urethral injuries in any of the patients with bladder rupture. CONCLUSION: Significant (more than 50 RBCs/high-power field) hematuria is the principal indication for evaluation for blunt bladder injury, and retrograde cystography is the diagnostic procedure of choice. CT is neither sensitive nor specific enough as primary diagnostic modality. \nA novel mutation in the invariant AG of the acceptor splice site of intron 4 of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit gene in two unrelated American black GM2-gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease) patients. Samples of genomic DNA from three unrelated American black infants having both biochemical and clinical features of classical infantile Tay-Sachs disease were sequenced following PCR amplification. A G----T transversion was observed in the AG acceptor splice site preceding exon 5 of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit gene in the first black family. This transversion changed the acceptor splice site from the consensus sequence, AG, to AT, thereby interfering with splicing at this intron 4/exon 5 junction. The proband was homozygous for this mutation; his mother and a brother are heterozygous. The same mutation was found in a second, apparently unrelated, black GM2-gangliosidosis patient. The second patient was a compound heterozygote, as only one allele carried this mutation. The mother and a brother in this second family are carriers for this mutation, while the father and a noncarrier sister are normal for this region of the gene. The third proband did not have this mutation; nor did the mother of a fourth black proband. Eight other independently ascertained non-black, non-Jewish, GM2-gangliosidosis families did not have this mutation. The observation of the same novel mutation in two unrelated black GM2-gangliosidosis patients indicates that the American black population has segregating within it at least one GM2-gangliosidosis mutation which may be specific to this population and not a result of migration. \nBopindolol: Czechoslovak experience with a new beta blocker in the treatment of hypertension. Bopindolol is a nonselective beta blocker with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. One of the drug's main benefits is its prolonged effect, lasting for 24 hours, which makes it possible to administer bopindolol in a single daily dose, a fact that may improve patient adherence to therapy. A double-blind study was performed in two centers, comparing bopindolol with metoprolol in 86 hypertensive patients. Baseline diastolic blood pressure (BP) was 100 to 120 mm Hg. The effects of bopindolol or metoprolol on BP and heart rate were similar: return to normal values was achieved in 70% of patients with either drug. A 6-month study at another center found that bopindolol did not affect the levels of total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. Another 12-month study documented a decrease in total cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) A1 and apo B. The apo A/B ratio rose, thus improving the atherosclerotic index. No deterioration of glucose tolerance or immunoreactive insulin response to glucose was seen after 6 months of bopindolol administration. Bopindolol satisfactorily modifies not only resting but also exercise BP during isometric and isotonic load, thus reducing BP fluctuation during physical activities of the hypertensive patient. The drug exerts no effect on renal and liver function, electrolyte balance and hematologic parameters. Bopindolol is a very useful drug of first choice in mild and moderate hypertension. Bopindolol's main advantages include its prolonged action, good tolerance and a beneficial effect on risk factors of atherosclerosis (lipid and carbohydrate metabolism). \nShort and long term outcome of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in unstable versus stable angina pectoris: a report of the 1985-1986 NHLBI PTCA Registry. In a cohort of 1,720 consecutive patients from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Registry (August 1985-May 1986), we compared 768 patients (45%) with stable angina and 952 patients (55%) with unstable angina pectoris. Unstable angina patients exhibited at least one of the following characteristics: new onset angina, rapidly progressing angina, angina at rest, angina refractory to medication, variant angina, acute coronary insufficiency, or angina recurring shortly after an acute myocardial infarct. The distribution of single- and multi-vessel disease was similar among stable and unstable angina patients; multi-vessel disease predominated. Average severity of stenosis and incidence of tubular and diffuse stenosis morphology were higher among patients with unstable angina (both p less than 0.001). Patient success rates were similar in stable and unstable patients. However, on a per lesion basis, overall angiographic success rate and average reduction of severity of stenosis in successfully dilated lesions were significantly higher among patients with unstable angina (both p less than 0.001). Incidence of major patient complications (p less than 0.01) and of emergency coronary bypass surgery (p less than 0.05) were also higher in patients with unstable angina but consistent with their more precarious clinical condition and stenosis morphology. During a two year follow-up, the cumulative distributions of death, myocardial infarct, repeat PTCA, and coronary bypass surgery were not significantly different in patients with stable angina compared to patients with unstable angina. Comparison of the current PTCA Registry cohort with the cases reported in the 1979-1982 Registry revealed a 19% higher success rate for both stable and unstable angina patients. Major complication rates decreased between time periods for stable but not for unstable angina patients. Incidence of emergency bypass surgery decreased more for stable than for unstable angina patients. Coronary angioplasty is indicated in properly selected patients with unstable angina and both single- and multi-vessel coronary disease. \nExperimental treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion. The role of laser energy in the treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion was evaluated in two sets of experiments. First, 10 polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were used to replace segments of the superficial femoral arteries in dogs and were thrombosed by distal ligation. Occlusion was maintained for one hour, or for 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in each of two grafts. Patency was restored in all 10 grafts without perforation or anastomotic disruption using a 2 mm hot tip probe powered by an Argon laser. However, increased organization of thrombus related to the duration of occlusion lead to decreased laser channel diameters, and 75% of the 28 day thrombus remained in the graft after recanalization. The second experiments tested the added benefit of thrombolytic infusion following laser recanalization. Bilateral external iliac artery thrombosis was induced in dogs by operative vessel isolation, de-endothelialization, and thrombin injection. At 7 days the efficacy of laser-assisted thrombolysis (LAT) versus enzymatic thrombolysis (ET) alone was compared. Eight vessels underwent ET by urokinase (4000 I.U./min.); 14 vessels were laser recanalized prior to thrombolytic infusion. LAT was performed from a carotid artery approach in 8 vessels (antegrade) and from a femoral artery in 6 vessels (retrograde). In contrast to studies using the hot tip alone, both ET and LAT accomplished complete thrombus removal. However, LAT lead to significant iliac arterial flow in 9 +/- 8 min. (antegrade) and 25 +/- 8 min. (retrograde) while ET required 109 +/- 47 min (p less than 0.01). \nFetal akinesia deformation sequence (Pena-Shokeir phenotype) associated with acquired intrauterine brain damage. An infant with Pena-Shokeir phenotype was born to a cocaine-using mother. The pathologic findings included polyhydramnios, facial anomalies, arthrogryposis, camptodactyly, pulmonary hypoplasia, and tetralogy of Fallot. The neuropathologic findings were diffuse brainstem and spinal cord neuronal degeneration and focal cerebral infarction, consistent with acquired intrauterine ischemic damage. \nThe infectious and hematologic otolaryngic complications of myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy. The otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon is frequently consulted to evaluate patients before the administration of myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy. Fifty consecutive patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania Oncology Center were studied before and during chemotherapy for adult leukemia or bone marrow transplantation. Otolaryngic history, physical examination, radiographic studies, and hematologic surveys were analyzed for the duration of therapy in an attempt to identify risk factors for infectious and hematologic otolaryngic complications. Two-thirds of the patient studied experienced untoward effects that required the further attention of an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon. The various complications and associated correlations with the study parameters before and during chemotherapy are discussed. \nElevated plasma chromogranin-A concentrations in prostatic carcinoma. Chromogranin-A is considered a sensitive immunohistochemical tissue marker in neuroendocrine prostatic carcinoma. We report that the plasma chromogranin-A level was elevated in 48% of 25 patients with stage D2 prostate cancer, and suggest that this marker can be used to monitor the clinical course of these patients. \nThoracic myelopathy caused by ossification of the ligamentum flavum. Clinicopathologic study and surgical treatment. The authors reviewed 14 patients with thoracic myelopathy caused by ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF). The predominant locality of symptomatic OLF was at the thoracolumbar junction, particularly at T10-11 followed by T11-12. At the level of the thickest OLF in each patient, there were three types of OLF from computed tomography and operative findings: a lateral type in 3 patients, diffuse in 8, and thickened nodular in 3. The diagnosis of OLF-related thoracic spinal canal stenosis was best made by enhanced computed tomography. Histologic study revealed that the developmental mode of OLF was mainly endochondral ossification. Numerous fibrocartilaginous cells were found in the increased and swollen collagen fibers forming the hypertrophic ligamentum flavum (HLF). Ossification extended along the superficial layer of HLF. The size or extension of OLF was relevant to the corresponding diathesis of spinalhyperostosis. Results of laminectomy for OLF were poor because of the high occurrence of complications early on or later deterioration. Therefore, laminoplasty is recommended as a successful procedure for OLF-related thoracic myelopathy, avoiding further local mechanical stress due to tensile force. \nSignificance of a negative exercise thallium test in the presence of a critical residual stenosis after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. After thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, increasing emphasis is placed on early submaximal exercise testing, with further intervention advocated only for demonstrable ischemia. Although significant residual coronary artery lesions after successful thrombolysis are common, many patients paradoxically have no corresponding provokable ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS. The relation between significant postthrombolytic residual coronary artery disease and a negative early, submaximal exercise thallium-201 tomogram was studied among 101 consecutive patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction and at least 70% residual stenosis of the infarct artery. A negative test occurred in 49 (48.5%) patients with a mean 88% residual infarct artery stenosis. Further characteristics of the group were as follows: mean time to treatment was 3.1 hours; mean age was 54 +/- 10 years; 80% were male; 47% had anterior infarction; 39% had multivessel disease; mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 53 +/- 14%; and mean peak creatine kinase level was 3,820 +/- 3,123 IU/ml. A similar group of 52 (51.5%) patients, treated within 3.3 hours from symptom onset, with a mean postthrombolysis stenosis of 90%, had a positive exercise test. Characteristics of this group were as follows: age was 58 +/- 10 years; 92% were male; 56% had anterior infarction; 40% had multivessel disease; and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 54 +/- 15%. The peak creatine kinase level associated with the infarction, however, was lower: 2,605 +/- 1,805 IU/ml (p = 0.04). There was no difference in performance at exercise testing with respect to peak systolic pressure, peak heart rate, or time tolerated on the treadmill between the two groups. By multivariate logistic regression, only peak creatine kinase level predicted a negative stress result in the presence of a significant residual stenosis (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-16.3). CONCLUSIONS. The explanation for the relatively frequent finding of a negative early stress 201Tl tomogram after apparently successful reperfusion appears to be more extensive myocardial necrosis and not delay in therapy or inadequate exercise performance. \nTherapeutic effects of genetically engineered toxin (DAB486IL-2) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In DAB486IL-2 the receptor-binding domain of native diphtheria toxin is replaced by human IL-2 sequences. This recombinant fusion protein is selectively cytotoxic for cells bearing high-affinity IL-2 receptors--eg, leukaemic cells. A patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who did not respond to gamma interferon and conventional antileukaemic drugs has responded to DAB486IL-2. \nThe prevalence of autoantibodies during third-trimester pregnancy complicated by hypertension or idiopathic fetal growth retardation. Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, antinuclear, anti-deoxyribonucleic acid, antithyroglobulin, and antithyroid microsomal antibodies were assayed during third-trimester pregnancy (100 normal, 100 with complications). In spite of a normal activated partial thromboplastin time in all instances, lupus anticoagulant was further investigated by three additional procedures: tissue thromboplastin inhibition time, platelet neutralization procedure, and cephalin neutralization test. The prevalence of autoantibodies in pregnancies with hypertension reaches 16% (four with lupus anticoagulant, two with anticardiolipin, and two with antithyroid microsomal antibodies), which is significantly greater than that for idiopathic fetal growth retardation (2%) (one with lupus anticoagulant antibodies) and normal pregnancies (3%) (two with antithyroglobulin and one with autithyroid microsomal antibodies) (p less than 0.01). Autoantibodies were equally distributed between patients with gestational hypertension and those with preeclampsia. When compared with the 42 patients with hypertension and no autoantibodies, the eight patients with autoantibody had a more frequent history of fetal growth retardation (p less than 0.05), but there was no difference in the severity of hypertension, the frequency of obstetric complications, or the outcome of pregnancy. They did not require any specific treatment. \nAtrial fibrillation associated with autonomic dysreflexia in patients with tetraplegia. Atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia characterized by disorganized atrial depolarizations and an irregular ventricular response. Most patients with atrial fibrillation have underlying cardiac pathology. This paper presents the cases of three patients with high-level spinal cord injury and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia who developed atrial fibrillation without any cardiac or metabolic disease that would predispose them to this. The paper proposes that autonomic dysreflexia might predispose a patient to atrial fibrillation by altering the pattern of repolarization of the atria, making the heart susceptible to a reentrant type of arrhythmia. High-level spinal cord injured patients may be at increased risk for the development of atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia which, if left untreated, can increase the incidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident that could further impair the patient's functional status. \nSelection of the approach to the distal internal carotid artery from the second cervical vertebra to the base of the skull. Although several approaches for exposure of distal internal carotid artery lesions have been reported, the precise anatomic levels for which each of these maneuvers are most appropriate have not been well described. Since these techniques may require preoperative preparation, it is useful to determine in advance how much exposure will be needed and to select the most suitable and effective technique. We used anatomic dissection in 12 human cadaver specimens (24 carotid bifurcations) to define the limits of distal internal carotid artery exposure by several commonly advocated methods. The standard anterior approach along the sternocleidomastoid muscle allowed exposure of the internal carotid artery to the level of the upper one third of the second cervical vertebra. The upper limit of this exposure was extended to the middle of the first cervical vertebra by division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Anterior subluxation of the mandible increased the distal exposure of the internal carotid artery to the superior border of the first cervical vertebra. Styloidectomy in combination with the preceding maneuvers extended the exposure an additional 0.5 cm cephalad. Lateral mandibulotomy did not significantly extend exposure beyond that obtained with mandibular subluxation and styloidectomy. Exposure of the internal carotid artery in the 1 cm immediately below the base of the skull required a posterior approach with mastoidectomy. \nTime course of creatine kinase release after termination of sustained ventricular dysrhythmias. Differentiation between primary and secondary (caused by acute myocardial infarction) ventricular fibrillation has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is based on clinical, ECG, and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (MBCK) activity. Enzymatic criteria might not be able to confirm the diagnosis of myocardial infarction after recent cardioversion. The routine use of electrophysiologic studies involving the induction and termination of ventricular dysrhythmias provides a setting in which enzyme release as a result of cardioversion alone can be examined. Therefore a systematic investigation of the magnitude and time course of creatine kinase (CK) and MBCK release was performed after termination of ventricular dysrhythmias in 57 patients undergoing electrophysiologic studies. Of patients requiring external cardioversion, only 50% had an elevation in CK and MBCK activity. Elevation when present corrected with the number of shocks and cumulative energy delivered. The magnitude of MBCK release exceeded 10% of the total CK activity in 9% of observations. Pace-termination of ventricular tachycardia did not result in enzyme release. Arrhythmia characteristics, coronary artery disease, and left ventricular function did not affect the magnitude of the time course of enzyme release. These data suggest that cardioversion with multiple shocks may result in a component of MBCK release, and thus a false positive diagnosis of primary acute myocardial infarction may be made by relying exclusively on the enzyme release pattern. \nPercutaneous mitral valvuloplasty following surgical repair of sinus venosus atrial septal defect. Mitral valvuloplasty performed 5 y after repair of a sinus venosus ASD was difficult because of a thickened septum, but resulted in improved mitral valve opening and did not lead to ASD. Thus, prior repair of a sinus venosus ASD may not be an absolute contraindication to mitral valvuloplasty. \nLumbar regional anaesthesia and prophylactic anticoagulant therapy. Is the combination safe? A survey has been carried out in all Danish anaesthetic departments (n = 80) regarding the attitude towards the use of epidural/spinal lumbar analgesia in patients who were receiving prophylactic anticoagulant therapy for the prevention of thromboembolism. About 60% of the departments used the techniques in patients receiving low-dose heparin and no side effects had been experienced. Spinal and epidural anaesthesia were in general regarded as being contraindicated in patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. In the world literature, the attitude towards the combination is conflicting. No randomised trial has been performed and complications are almost entirely confined to patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. Only one case of an epidural haematoma has been recorded when subcutaneous low-dose heparin was used as thromboprophylaxis. \nLocal toxicity with subcutaneous methadone. Experience of two centers. We report on 8 patients treated with subcutaneous methadone for cancer-related pain at 2 institutions. The success of other subcutaneous agents for pain control has been well demonstrated. It was felt that methadone would be useful due to its low cost. Unfortunately, 7 of the 8 patients experienced adverse reactions at the subcutaneous sites requiring cessation of subcutaneous methadone. \nEffect of calcification on in vivo mechanical response of rabbit arteries to balloon dilation. BACKGROUND. Atherosclerosis has been associated with loss of artery wall distensibility in human cadavers and in experimental animal models, giving it the lay term \"hardening of the arteries.\" METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the effect of calcification on arterial distensibility, balloon pressure and volume were recorded during dilation of calcified aortas in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits in vivo. Calcification was induced by dietary supplements of cholesterol, vitamin D2, and calcium. Balloon pressure, volume, and time signals were acquired at high frequency with controls for temperature and balloon inflation rate. Resistance to balloon dilation was minimal in control rabbit aortas (delta Vmax = 5.0 +/- 3.5 microliters) and in excised nonatherosclerotic human coronary arteries, and it was small in aortas from cholesterol-fed rabbits (12.3 +/- 8 microliters), even when lipid levels were markedly elevated by a high cholesterol diet (611 +/- 347 mg/dl). With dietary cholesterol, vitamin D2, and calcium supplements, WHHL rabbits developed mild hypercalcemia (15 +/- 1.9 mg/dl), hypercholesterolemia (1,100 +/- 633 mg/dl), moderate-to-marked aortic calcification, and high resistance to balloon dilation (38 +/- 27) comparable to that seen in angioplasty patients. CONCLUSIONS. It is concluded that experimentally induced calcification decreases the distensibility of the rabbit aorta in vivo and that it yields to balloon dilation by plastic deformation closely resembling that seen in balloon angioplasty of human coronary arteries. These findings suggest that calcification contributes to arterial \"hardening\" associated with atherosclerosis. \nRelationship between the timing of aneurysm surgery and the development of delayed cerebral ischemia. A consecutive series of 145 patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were operated on within 7 days of SAH and were prospectively evaluated over a 4-year period to determine if the timing of aneurysm surgery influenced the development of delayed cerebral ischemia. All patients were managed with a standardized policy of urgent surgical clipping and treatment with aggressive prophylactic postoperative volume expansion. Patients with delayed ischemic symptoms were additionally treated with induced hypertension. Forty-nine patients underwent surgery on Day 0 or 1 (Group 1) post-SAH, 60 patients on Day 2 or 3 (Group 2), and 36 patients on Days 4 through 7 (Group 3). Postoperative delayed cerebral ischemia developed in 16% of (Group 1) patients, in 22% of Group 2 patients, and in 28% of Group 3 patients. Cerebral infarction resulting from delayed cerebral ischemia developed in only 4% of Group 1 patients, 10% of Group 2 patients, and 11% of Group 3 patients. A bad clinical outcome as a result of delayed cerebral ischemia occurred in one Group 1 patient (2%), two Group 2 patients (3%), and one Group 3 patient (3%). Preoperative grade was not significantly correlated with the incidence or severity of delayed cerebral ischemia at any time interval except that patients in modified Hunt and Hess Grade I or II who underwent surgery on Day 0 or 1 after SAH had no strokes or bad outcomes from delayed cerebral ischemia. This study demonstrates that there is no rationale for delaying aneurysm surgery based on the time interval between SAH and patient evaluation. \nCarnitine deficiency associated with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. An infant with X-linked recessive ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is described who also had severe deficiency of plasma and liver carnitine during normoammonemic periods. Treatment with L-carnitine (100 mg/kg/day) for 12 months decreased the frequency of hospitalizations for hyperammonemia, although it did not alter his neurologic status. This report demonstrates that persistent carnitine deficiency may be present in patients with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency even when plasma ammonia is normal. Carnitine evaluation and supplementation may be important in the treatment of patients with this metabolic disorder. \nDo primary dysfunctions in neural control of arterial pressure contribute to hypertension? This article is a summary of the physiological and clinical evidence that links the cause of essential hypertension to the brain. We stress the potential importance of a biochemical disturbance in the central role of angiotensin II in the regulation of arterial pressure. While the evidence is compelling, we acknowledge the need for further complete studies on this timely subject. \nOral contraceptive-associated liver cell adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cytomorphology and mechanism of malignant transformation. From January 1976 to May 1990, 1673 patients with a liver mass or masses detected by imaging techniques underwent percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the liver. Of these, 99 were diagnosed cytologically as \"hepatocellular carcinoma\" and 9 as \"consistent with liver cell adenoma.\" The cytologic diagnoses were confirmed in the follow-up of all cases. Among the 99 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 3 had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 10, 11, and 12 years, respectively. The nine patients with liver cell adenoma were all users of oral contraceptives over a period ranging from 5 to 10 years. Of these, two who had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 8 and 10 years, respectively, had foci or areas of liver cell dysplasia within the adenomas. The cytologic criteria for the diagnosis of liver cell dysplasia included cytoplasmic and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism together with prominent nucleoli, hyperchromasia and multinucleation. The cytologic features of liver cell dysplasia strikingly mimic hepatocellular carcinoma. From this study, the foci or areas of liver cell dysplasia arising within the liver cell adenomas appear to be the missing link responsible for the transformation of liver cell adenoma to carcinoma. It is believed that liver cell adenomas are not premalignant and may undergo reversible change after withdrawal of causative agents, whereas liver cell dysplasia is an irreversible, premalignant change and will eventually progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. \nOvarian ablation failures by radiation: a comparison of two dose schedules. Sixty Chinese breast cancer patients underwent ovarian irradiation with one of two dose schedules: 12 Gy/4 fractions/4-6 days or 14 Gy/4 fractions/4-6 days. The ovarian ablation failure rates were 14% and 0% respectively in patients above 40 years of age. The overall ablation failure rate in younger patients was unacceptably high at 35%. The significance of the findings is discussed. \nOlfactory dysfunction in three neurodegenerative diseases. Olfactory dysfunction is among the first signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD), idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and the parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) of Guam. We have recently demonstrated that the odor identification and detection deficits of patients with PD are equivalent to those of patients with mild AD when subtle differences in cognitive function are statistically controlled for by analysis of covariance. In contrast, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and patients with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism evidence olfactory function much more similar to that of normal controls. In the present study, we administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and the Picture Identification Test to 24 patients with early signs of the PDC of Guam and statistically compared their test scores to those of 24 early-stage AD and 24 early-stage PD patients of similar age and gender from the United States mainland. Although the PDC group evidenced slightly more difficulty in identifying pictures than did the other 2 groups, the odor identification deficit associated with this disorder was of the same magnitude as that observed in AD and PD, suggesting that olfactory testing cannot be used to distinguish among these 3 diseases and that the olfactory dysfunction of these disorders may reflect a common neurologic substrate. \nMammographic guidewire localization of nonpalpable breast lesions. Guidewire-directed biopsy is the predominant method of evaluating nonpalpable breast lesions detected by mammography. It is an accurate and safe procedure for obtaining a histologic evaluation of abnormal tissue, leading to early diagnosis and improved survival rates. This report reviews 526 needle localizations and biopsies of nonpalpable breast lesions performed in two community hospitals over a 39-month period and compares early results with those achieved in the last 13 months of the study. This review indicates that as experience in using this modality increased, the cancer detection rate increased and the percentage of invasive cancers decreased. The percentage of cancers detected in the final 13 months of the study (19%, Group II) was higher than in the first 26 months of the study (13%, Group I). Although microcalcifications were found in 24 per cent of the mammograms leading to a diagnosis of cancer, they did not prove to be a reliable indicator of malignancy in this study. \nParkinson's disease in Ferrara, Italy, 1967 through 1987. Epidemiological surveys on Parkinson's disease that have been carried out in different parts of the world have suggested that the disease is uniformly distributed in white populations. The position with regard to the Mediterranean peoples is still controversial, because of the large variation of the frequencies observed in the different areas that have been investigated. We therefore studied the frequency of Parkinson's disease in the Local Health Service of Ferrara, northeastern Italy (mean population, 187,000). Based on 394 patients, the mean incidence per year for the period from 1967 through 1987 was 10.01/100,000. The incidence rate of Parkinson's disease among cases with early onset was found to be statistically higher in rural areas as compared with urban ones (6.32/100,000 vs 3.11/100,000). Moreover, the study revealed a significantly higher incidence rate among agricultural workers (20.6/100,000). These results would seem to give further support to the hypothesis of a possible causal role of environmental factors that are mainly linked to agriculture, most likely due to the continual exposure to toxic agents in this area. However, further studies, which are not exclusively epidemiological, are necessary before any conclusions may be drawn, because many confounding variables may account for the results from surveys of this type. \nCommon bile duct and intrahepatic stones: results of transhepatic electrohydraulic lithotripsy in 50 patients. Percutaneous, transhepatic, intracorporeal, electrohydraulic shock wave lithotripsy was performed in 50 patients after failure of endoscopic treatment (n = 43) or directly in patients with a strictured hepaticojejunostomy (n = 7). Twenty-seven patients had common bile duct stones; 23, intrahepatic stones. Three steps were used: A transhepatic bilicutaneous fistula was created, a wide communication between the bile duct and the gut was established, and contact shock wave lithotripsy was performed under endoscopic guidance. Afterward, 46 patients were free of stones. In four patients with diffuse intrahepatic lithiasis, only 75% of stones could be cleared. Severe complications, seen in 11 patients (hemobilia necessitating transfusion [n = 6], bile duct perforation resulting in cholangitis [n = 3], acute pulmonary edema [n = 1], and hemothorax [n = 1]), were fatal in four patients; all occurred early in the study. The authors modified their technique by dilating the biliary tract in two sessions 3 days apart, waiting 6 days for the tract to mature, and then introducing the cholangioscope directly through the skin, significantly reducing complications and mortality (P less than .005). \nChanges in mucociliary clearance during acute exacerbations of asthma. Previous studies have suggested that mucociliary clearance (MC) is impaired in asthmatic subjects. If so, impaired clearance may be an important factor in acute exacerbation. We proposed that if MC plays a significant role in acute illness, MC should be impaired during the exacerbation but improve after recovery. To test this hypothesis, five asthmatic patients with attacks requiring hospitalization underwent measurement of MC using radiolabeled aerosol and a gamma camera. They were studied on the second or third day after admission with repeat measurements after discharge. Spirometry was performed before all studies. After an equilibrium xenon scan (133Xe), which defined lung borders and measured regional volume, radiolabeled saline particles containing technetium-labeled (99mTC) sulfur colloid were deposited and used to label airway mucus. Deposition patterns were matched by regulating particle distribution and breathing pattern. MC was then measured as percentage retention of radioactivity at 10-min intervals for 2 h. When hospitalized, 96.0 +/- 2.06% (SEM) of the initial radioactivity was retained in the lung after 2 h, indicating little clearance of mucus from the lung. In fact, no significant changes were detected when activity at 120 min was compared with measurements at 10 min (99.2 +/- 0.22%, NS). After discharge clearance was markedly enhanced. That is, retention of lung activity was significantly lower at all time intervals from 10 min onward, with only 70.9 +/- 3.86% retained at 120 min (p = 0.008). During an asthmatic attack warranting hospital admission, MC is significantly impaired, with marked improvement following recovery. \nThe effect of ERCP on circulating pancreatic enzymes and pancreatic protease inhibitors. The pathogenesis of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-induced pancreatitis is poorly understood. To elucidate a role for pancreatic enzymes in ERCP-induced pancreatitis, we measured serum amylase, lipase, trypsin, and elastase in 25 patients undergoing ERCP. Serum alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin, two major pancreatic protease inhibitors, also were measured. All pancreatic enzymes measured rose significantly after ERCP. Pancreatic duct cannulation was associated with a greater elevation in serum amylase and lipase. Circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin was reduced by 7% (p = 0.04) 6 h after ERCP, whereas circulating alpha 1-antitrypsin increased over the same time period. Papillotomy, stent placement, or underlying disease did not influence changes any further. Three patients developed ERCP-induced pancreatitis. All three patients had circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin levels below 243 mg/dl (p = 0.03). The ERCP-induced alterations in circulating pancreatic enzymes and their inhibitors are similar to changes seen in clinical pancreatitis. Low circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin levels may predispose to ERCP-induced pancreatitis. \nStimulation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle by hypoxia. Hypoxia caused a progressive cytochalasin B-inhibitable increase in the rate of 3-O-methylglucose transport in rat epitrochlearis muscles to a level approximately six-fold above basal. Muscle ATP concentration was well maintained during hypoxia, and increased glucose transport activity was still present after 15 min of reoxygenation despite repletion of phosphocreatine. However, the increase in glucose transport activity completely reversed during a 180-min-long recovery in oxygenated medium. In perfused rat hindlimb muscles, hypoxia caused an increase in glucose transporters in the plasma membrane, suggesting that glucose transporter translocation plays a role in the stimulation of glucose transport by hypoxia. The maximal effects of hypoxia and insulin on glucose transport activity were additive, whereas the effects of exercise and hypoxia were not, providing evidence suggesting that hypoxia and exercise stimulate glucose transport by the same mechanism. Caffeine, at a concentration too low to cause muscle contraction or an increase in glucose transport by itself, markedly potentiated the effect of a submaximal hypoxic stimulus on sugar transport. Dantrolene significantly inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in 3-O-methylglucose transport. These effects of caffeine and dantrolene suggest that Ca2+ plays a role in the stimulation of glucose transport by hypoxia. \nTegmental dehiscence and brain herniation into the middle ear cleft. The tegmen tympani may occasionally be breached by herniation of the temporal lobe with or without dural cover. The clinical presentation may be obvious with CSF otorrhoea but less so with apparent middle ear effusion, CSF rhinnorrhoea, conductive hearing loss, recurrent meningitis or intracranial sepsis. Diagnosis requires suspicion of the condition, which may be aided by radiological imaging. Surgical repair is to be recommended: various techniques are available but bone enveloped by fascia placed by subtemporal approach is preferred. The features of this problem are highlighted by four cases. \nA case of chronic GM1 gangliosidosis presenting as dystonia: clinical and biochemical studies. Clinical and biochemical studies are reported on a 32-year-old man with GM1 gangliosidosis who presented with a slowly progressive dystonia that began when he was aged 7 years and eventually became almost totally incapacitating at the age of 35. There was only mild intellectual deterioration, but myoclonus, seizures and macular cherry-red spots were never observed. Proton-density and T2-weighted MRI scans showed symmetrical hyperintense lesions of both putamina. No increase of GM1 ganglioside was found in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid, and the metabolism of GM1 ganglioside in cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient was also almost normal, although the residual activity of GM1 ganglioside beta-galactosidase activity was only 10% of normal. These findings suggest that impaired GM1 ganglioside metabolism is not present systemically as it is in the infantile and juvenile types of the disorder, but is mainly confined to the central nervous system in chronic GM1 gangliosidosis. \nIntrathecal baclofen for intractable axial dystonia. Following spinal instrumentation for scoliosis, a patient developed intractable axial dystonia refractory to conservative medical management. We describe the successful treatment of this dystonia with a continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen and the subsequent long-term management. \nThe treatment of metastatic breast cancer. While metastatic breast cancer is not curable, it is treatable. Its treatment is associated with a relatively high rate of success, and patients are able to maintain a good quality of life for periods ranging from a few months to several years. This knowledge should encourage both the patient and the oncologist to maintain treatment as long as potentially effective therapeutic methods are available. Progress is ongoing both in the development of new forms of treatment and in new ways of using and combining already existing therapeutic modalities. There is still no established \"best\" or \"only\" first treatment of metastatic breast cancer. When secondary and later treatment is to be undertaken, the task of selecting the most appropriate treatment becomes even more complex. It is only through controlled clinical trials that useful therapeutic guidelines will develop. Treatment is a joint endeavor involving both the physician and the patient. Communication must remain open. In the final stages of the illness, treatment should be directed toward the relief of distressing symptoms and anxiety. \nCryptococcal pleural effusion preceding cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS. The authors report a case in which a small cryptococcal pleural effusion preceded the development of severe cryptococcal meningitis in an HIV-positive patient. The appearance of an isolated transient pleural effusion is a very unusual presentation for AIDS-related complications. The authors suggest that cryptococcal infection be considered in this setting. \nSmoking-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost--United States, 1988. Smoking is a leading cause of diseases associated with premature mortality in the United States; in 1985, these diseases accounted for an estimated 390,000 premature deaths. In this report, mortality data and estimates of smoking prevalence for 1988 are used to calculate smoking-attributable mortality (SAM), years of potential life lost (YPLL), and age-adjusted SAM and YPLL rates for the United States. Calculations were performed using Smoking-Attributable Mortality, Morbidity, and Economic Cost (SAMMEC II) software, which includes relative risk estimates for 22 adult (i.e., greater than or equal to 35 years of age) smoking-related diseases and relative risk estimates for four perinatal (i.e., less than 1 year of age) conditions. Age-, sex-, and race-specific mortality data for 1988 were obtained from CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Data on burn deaths caused by cigarettes were obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The estimated number of deaths among nonsmokers from lung cancer attributable to passive smoking was obtained from a report of the National Academy of Sciences. Age-, sex-, and race-specific current and former smoking prevalence rates in 1988 for adults aged greater than or equal to 35 years and for women aged 18-44 years were estimated by linear extrapolation using National Health Interview Survey data for 1974-1987. \nQuestionable cancer practices in Tijuana and other Mexican border clinics. Tijuana, Mexico, has become a refuge for cancer patients who have been convinced that they may be cured of their terminal illness by unconventional, unproved, and disproved methods offered in the border clinics. About a dozen United States promoters have joined with Mexican colleagues to offer a variety of treatments. Some patients are diagnosed using standard methods prior to arrival at the clinics, but many healthy individuals are misdiagnosed as having cancer or \"precancer\" and are then treated there. Others are told they have been cured or are improving even though they still have active disease. The modalities and regimens used are often referred to as \"metabolic therapy\" and, for the most part, are either not based on sound scientific principles or have been shown in controlled clinical trials to be useless or even dangerous. A basic metabolic regimen consists of three phases: detoxification with fasting and bowel cleansing, strengthening the immune system with numerous \"supplements,\" and attacking cancer with \"natural and non-toxic\" chemicals. Popular treatments include injections of hydrogen peroxide, large quantities of pressed liver and carrot juice, coffee enemas, infusions of Laetrile mixed with massive doses of vitamins and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), special diets, and a host of other pseudoscientific regimens. Unfortunately, no evidence exists that any of these modalities is more effective than no treatment at all. Patients traveling to the Mexican border clinics for metabolic therapy are subjecting themselves to costly and hazardous regimens, especially if they forgo responsible medical care in the process. The American Cancer Society, therefore, strongly urges individuals with cancer not to seek treatment with metabolic therapies in the Mexican border clinics. \nKi-67 staining in histological subtypes of breast carcinoma and fine needle aspiration smears. Thirty four cases of invasive breast carcinoma were analysed for heterogeneity of Ki-67 reactivity in a tumour, and proliferative activity in various histological subtypes was compared. The growth factions determined in areas of central and peripheral tumour were the same. Mucinous and lobular carcinoma showed lower Ki-67 activity than ductal carcinomas. When ductal carcinomas were subdivided according to their dominant growth pattern, the carcinomas with a solid or comedo growth pattern showed the highest proliferative activity. These results largely confirm data from previous cell kinetic studies on the incorporation of radioactively labelled thymidine. A correlation between the growth fraction determined by Ki-67 in fine needle aspiration smears and cryostat sections of corresponding tumours was shown, implying that the immunostaining of cytological smears gives a reliable impression of the growth fraction of a tumour and may therefore be used in prospective studies. \nTransmetatarsal amputation: the role of adjunctive revascularization. Over a 12-year period, 160 transmetatarsal amputations were performed in patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease. The following groups were defined: group 1 - nonreconstructable disease (n = 40); group 2 - transmetatarsal amputation in conjunction with distal revascularization (n = 99); group 3 - reconstructable disease but transmetatarsal amputation performed without simultaneous revascularization (n = 21). There were nine early deaths in the entire series, for an operative mortality rate of 5.6%. The lowest rate of transmetatarsal amputation healing (24%) occurred in group 1. An 86% healing rate was achieved in group 3, but in seven cases (33%) some type of revascularization was required within 3 months of the amputation. In group 2 the healing rate was 62% but reached 83% where the bypass remained patent for at least 3 months after the amputation. Long-term patency rates also affected healing. Healing was not influenced by the number of local procedures (single vs multiple). The presence of severe infection or extensive necrosis necessitated open transmetatarsal amputation in 89 cases; the remaining 71 amputations involved primary closure. Since many patients were treated at a time when diagnostic modalities as well as the operative indications and techniques differed somewhat from the current practice, much of the information regarding group I patients in particular should be considered as a negative historical control and any conclusion from our data should be adjusted accordingly. Healing after amputation at the transmetatarsal level can be expected in the majority of instances in which revascularization can be performed with predictable patency, even when the standard criteria for performing such amputations are liberalized. \nThe relationship between esophageal motility disorders and microvascular angina. Patients with unexplained chest pain have caused investigators in cardiology, gastroenterology, and psychiatry to find abnormalities with overlap among the three specialties. This article reviews the data concerning the potential interrelation of chest pain of cardiac or esophageal origin. \nDeep brain stimulation: a review of basic research and clinical studies. Deep brain stimulation for pain control in humans was first used almost 30 years ago and has continued to receive considerable attention. Despite the large number of clinical reports describing pain relief, numerous studies have indicated that the results of these procedures vary considerably. In addition, many neurosurgeons find the procedures unpredictable, and considerable disagreement still exists regarding important issues related to the technique itself. This review gives an historical overview of the relevant basic and clinical literature and provides a critical examination of the clinical efficacy, choice of stimulation sites, parameters of stimulation, and effects on experimental pain. Finally, we give suggestions for future research that could more definitively determine the usefulness of deep brain stimulation for pain control. \nEstablishment of cell-to-cell contact by adoptively transferred adherent lymphokine-activated killer cells with metastatic murine melanoma cells. A murine model of pulmonary B16 melanoma was used to study the infiltration into metastases of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and adherent lymphokine-activated killer (A-LAK) cells and, specifically, to study whether A-LAK cells are able to leave the tumor microcirculation and establish cell-to-cell contact with malignant cells. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that A-LAK cells accumulated in metastases twice as efficiently as LAK cells during interleukin-2 stimulation. Electron microscopy of pulmonary metastases 16 hours after administration of 2.5 x 10(7) A-LAK cells revealed A-LAK cells, identified by the presence of typical two-compartment granules, in direct contact with melanoma cells. This finding was confirmed by using A-LAK cells prelabeled with polycationized ferritin. In conclusion, our observations demonstrate unambiguously the ability of adoptively transferred A-LAK cells to establish contact with extravascular metastatic melanoma cells. \nA comparison of hypertensive and nonhypertensive coronary care patients' cardiovascular responses to visitors. Patients with and without hypertension in a coronary care unit (n = 24) were compared with respect to cardiovascular responses to both a family visit and an interview by an investigator. Variables for each of the four cardiovascular indicators (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and premature ventricular contractions) included the value before, the highest value during, the lowest value during, and the value after each social interaction condition. The highest group means for systolic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly higher for patients with hypertension than for patients without hypertension under both the interview and visit conditions. Differences in cardiovascular responses were not significantly greater for family visits than for interviews for patients with hypertension compared with those without hypertension. Thus, although hypertensive patients had greater cardiovascular reactivity to both social interaction conditions than nonhypertensive patients in the coronary care unit, family visits were no more physiologically stressful than a comparative interaction condition. \nSurgical manipulation of primate cerebral arteries in established vasospasm. It is generally believed that surgery in the face of angiographic vasospasm is dangerous due to an increased incidence of postoperative cerebral ischemia. One theory is that arterial narrowing is exacerbated by surgical manipulation of vasospastic vessels during aneurysm dissection and clipping. This theory was tested in a primate model of cerebral vasospasm and the results reported. Six monkeys underwent baseline cerebral angiography, followed by induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on both sides of the circle of Willis. An equal amount of fresh autologous blood clot was placed around each internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral artery. Six days later, angiography was repeated and the right craniectomy was reopened for clot evacuation and surgical manipulation of the right cerebral arteries, including placement of a temporary aneurysm clip on the right middle cerebral artery. The left cerebral arteries were not exposed or manipulated, and served as controls. Twenty-four hours later angiography was repeated, then the animals were killed. Equal and significant vasospasm (greater than 40% reduction in vessel caliber compared to baseline, p less than 0.05) was seen in the middle cerebral arteries on both sides of the circle of Willis in all animals 6 and 7 days after SAH. There was no significant change in the severity of vasospasm on Day 7 compared with Day 6 in the right cerebral arteries. Increased risk of postoperative cerebral ischemia for surgery in the peak vasospasm period may be due to mechanisms other than increased arterial narrowing precipitated by surgical manipulation. \nAutopsy-verified pulmonary embolism in a surgical department: analysis of the period from 1951 to 1988. A retrospective analysis was undertaken of all surgical patients in Malmo, Sweden, during the period from 1951 to 1988 in whom pulmonary emboli were found at autopsy. The analysis included a comparison with the earlier analysed and reported time period from 1951 to 1980. A continued high frequency of pulmonary embolism at autopsy was seen during the 1980s (20.3 per cent of deaths, 31.7 per cent of autopsies). Of the 391 autopsy-verified pulmonary emboli found between 1981 and 1988, 113 (28.9 per cent) were considered fatal, 104 (26.6 per cent) contributed to death and 174 (44.5 per cent) were incidental. Few patients had symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism before death. The overall frequency of major pulmonary embolism in surgical patients remained unchanged (0.3 per cent). The frequency of major postoperative pulmonary embolism showed an increase during the 1950s and 1960s (maximum 0.4 per cent) but a decrease in the last 5-year period of the 1970s (0.3 per cent), which has earlier been reported upon. This decrease continued during the 1980s (0.2 per cent) (P less than 0.05). An increase was found in the number of patients operated on who had autopsy-proven pulmonary embolism and who received thromboprophylaxis. Pulmonary embolism continues to be a major cause of death in surgical patients; however, postoperative major pulmonary embolism has shown a reduction in the last 15-year period. \nImprovement by acetylcysteine of hemodynamics and oxygen transport in fulminant hepatic failure. BACKGROUND. When administered early after an overdose of acetaminophen, intravenous acetylcysteine prevents hepatic necrosis by replenishing reduced stores of glutathione. How acetylcysteine improves the survival of patients with established liver damage induced by acetaminophen, however, is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether the beneficial effect of acetylcysteine under such circumstances could be due to enhancement of oxygen delivery and consumption. METHODS. We studied the effect of acetylcysteine on systemic hemodynamics and oxygen transport in 12 patients with acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and 8 patients with acute liver failure from other causes. The acetylcysteine was given in a dose of 150 mg per kilogram of body weight in 250 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 15 minutes and then in a dose of 50 mg per kilogram in 500 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 4 hours; measurements were made before treatment began and after 30 minutes of the regimen. RESULTS. In the patients with acetaminophen-induced liver failure, the infusion of acetylcysteine resulted in an increase in mean oxygen delivery from 856 to 975 ml per minute per square meter of body-surface area (P = 0.0036), due to an increase in the cardiac index from 5.6 to 6.7 liters per minute per square meter (P = 0.0021). Mean arterial pressure rose from 88 to 95 mm Hg (P = 0.0054) despite a decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1296 to 1113 dyn.sec.cm-5 per square meter (P = 0.027). There was an increase in oxygen consumption from 127 to 184 ml per minute per square meter (P = 0.0007) associated with an increase in the oxygen-extraction ratio from 16 to 21 percent (P = 0.022). The effects in the patients with acute liver failure from other causes were similar. CONCLUSIONS. The increase in oxygen delivery and consumption in response to acetylcysteine may account for its beneficial effect on survival in patients with fulminant hepatic failure induced by acetaminophen. \nCNS pathology in the neurological mutant rats zitter, tremor and zitter-tremor double mutant (spontaneously epileptic rat, SER). Exaggeration of clinical and neuropathological phenotypes in SER. The pathological alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) were examined in three kinds of mutant rat; the zitter (zi/zi; Zi), the tremor rat (tm/tm; Tm) and the spontaneously epileptic rat (SER) which is a double mutant carrying both zitter and tremor genes. Two major alterations demonstrated in these mutants were hypomyelination and vacuolation or spongy degeneration. Hypomyelination was observed predominantly in SER and to a lesser extent in Zi, and was accompanied by a redundant or aberrant myelin sheath formation in addition to a decreased number of myelinated fibres. This appeared to be related to the occurrence of tremor. There was no abnormality in the structure of the myelin lamellae and oligodendrocytes or any destruction of myelin sheaths by phagocytic cells. The number of radial components in CNS myelin was increased almost equally in Zi, Tm and SER. Vacuolation was prominent in SER and Tm, especially in the brainstem and thalamus. Zi also developed mild vacuolation with advancing age. Vacuolation seemed to be related to the epileptic phenomena in SER and Tm. Vacuoles consisted mainly of swollen astrocytic processes and enlargement of the extracellular space, as well as occasional enlargement of periaxonal spaces. Thus both pathological findings--the hypomyelination derived from the zitter mutation with tremor, and the vacuolation from the tremor mutation with epileptic symptoms--were mutually exaggerated in SER. It is postulated that the two different genetic loci with zi and tm mutations interact and synergistically reinforce each other both clinically and pathologically in SER. \nEtiology of infection and morphologic changes in the lungs of Filipino children who die of pneumonia. Histopathologic studies and isolation of virus and bacteria in culture were carried out for 71 children less than 5 years of age with fatal pneumonia. A potential microbial etiology was identified for 61 children (86%): bacteria for 19 (27%), virus for 16 (23%), and virus plus bacteria for 26 (37%). Staphylococcus was the most prevalent pathogen, alone or in combination with other organisms, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viral infection may predispose to bacterial infection in some children. A correlation of clinical course, results of cultures, and morphologic changes revealed cofactors that may have contributed to a fatal outcome. Lung abscess, pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis, and meningitis were associated with bacterial infection. Many patients in this study had severe bronchopneumonia, with a high prevalence of complications such as abscess (62%), atelectasis (40%), pericarditis (28%), and empyema (7%). Such complications added to multiple infections, measles, and malnutrition contributed to the fatal outcome in these children. \nCortical dysplasia in temporal lobe epilepsy: magnetic resonance imaging correlations. Cortical dysplasia has been documented in histological specimens surgically removed for treatment of refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. We studied 10 patients with cortical dysplasia and complex partial seizures who underwent temporal lobectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormalities in 5 of the patients who had microscopically detectable major abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an abnormal cortical-white matter architectonic pattern in 2 patients with moderate cortical dysplasia. In the remaining 3 patients, magnetic resonance imaging findings were unremarkable. These observations suggest that magnetic resonance imaging is sensitive in the detection of certain dysplastic lesions in temporal lobe epilepsy. Preoperative identification of these abnormalities by magnetic resonance imaging may permit early and optimal surgical treatment in patients with refractory epilepsy. \nFemoro-femoral or ilio-femoral bypass for unilateral inflow reconstruction? Femoro-femoral and ilio-femoral bypass are two popular options for unilateral inflow reconstruction. In order to evaluate these alternative approaches, the records of 70 consecutive patients who underwent either femoro-femoral (n = 50) or ilio-femoral (n = 22) grafts were retrospectively reviewed. There were 46 men and 24 women, ranging in age from 27 to 84 years (mean: 66 years). Operative mortality was 10% for all femoro-femoral procedures, including 50% for emergent, 14% for synchronous, and 0% for solitary procedures; mortality was 9% for all ilio-femoral grafts including 20% for synchronous and 6% for solitary procedures. Among the elective solitary procedures, there was no significant difference with respect to operative time, blood loss, fluid requirement, time until resuming an oral diet, or duration of postoperative course for the two procedures. Five-year patency was 93% for all ilio-femoral and 57% for all femoro-femoral grafts. Although femoro-femoral bypass has been the more popular option for unilateral inflow reconstruction in this and other institutions, these findings justify the more widespread use of ilio-femoral bypass. \nCloning and expression of the human vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuroendocrine mediator found in the central and peripheral nervous system. Distinct subsets of neural, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune cells bear specific high-affinity receptors for VIP, which are associated with a guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein capable of activating adenylate cyclase. A cDNA clone (GPRN1) encoding the human VIP receptor was identified in libraries prepared from the Nalm 6 line of leukemic pre-B lymphoblasts and the HT-29 line of colon carcinoma cells. The deduced 362-amino acid polypeptide sequence encoded by GPRN1 shares a seven-transmembrane-segment hydropathicity profile with other G protein-coupled receptors. Northern blot analyses identified a 2.7-kilobase transcript of the VIP receptor in Nalm 6 and HT-29 cells as well as in tissues from rat brain, colon, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, and small intestine. COS-6 cells transfected with GPRN1 bound 125I-labeled VIP specifically with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.5 nM. VIP--and less effectively secretin, peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), and glucagon competitively displaced bound 125I-VIP from transfected COS-6 cells, with potencies in the order VIP greater than secretin = PHI much greater than glucagon. VIP stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells, inducing a 3-fold increase in the intracellular level of cAMP. When the antisense orientation of the VIP receptor clone was introduced into HT-29 cells, there was a 50% suppression of the specific binding of 125I-VIP and of the VIP-induced increase in cAMP level, relative to untransfected cells. The VIP receptor cloned exhibits less than or equal to 24% homology with other receptors in the same superfamily and thus represents a subset of G protein-coupled receptors for peptide ligands. \nAcinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas: a rare cause of left-sided portal hypertension. Isolated splenic vein obstruction with left-sided portal hypertension is a rare clinical condition. Owing to the close relationship of the splenic vein and the pancreas, this rare phenomenon is usually secondary to pancreatic inflammation or neoplasm. Acinar cell carcinoma has long been recognized as a distinctive, rare type of pancreatic carcinoma. A case of isolated splenic vein obstruction with left-sided portal hypertension secondary to acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas, which we are reporting here, is thought to the first documented in the literature. \nIncidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer in New Hampshire and Vermont. A survey of skin cancer occurrence between June 1979 and May 1980 among residents of New Hampshire and Vermont identified 277 cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 1761 cases of basal cell carcinoma. The age-adjusted incidence rates for squamous cell carcinoma (32 per 100,000 in men, 8 per 100,000 in women) and for basal cell carcinoma (159 per 100,000 in men, 87 per 100,000 in women) were similar to those reported in other populations in the northern United States. Skin cancer incidence was particularly high among men more than 70 years of age and a large proportion (greater than 30%) of patients 55 years or older had a history of at least one previous skin cancer. \nClinical and biologic features of childhood T-cell leukemia with the t(11;14). Cytogenetic analysis of cells from 622 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and successful G-banding chromosome studies disclosed seven cases with the t(11;14)(p13;q11) and one with the t(11;14)(p15;q11). Leukemia cells in all eight cases had a T-cell immunophenotype. The t(11;14)(p13;q11) occurred in 6.8% and the t(11;14)(p15;q11) in 1% of T-cell ALL cases (n = 103). The t(11;14) was associated with presenting clinical features typical of T-cell ALL: male predominance (n = 6), age greater than 10 years (n = 3), hyperleukocytosis (white blood cells greater than 100 x 10(9)/L, n = 5), relatively high hemoglobin level (median, 10.8 g/dL), high serum lactic dehydrogenase level (median, 3248 U/L), presence of mediastinal mass (n = 6), and central nervous system leukemia (n = 2). While there were no significant differences in presenting feature",
