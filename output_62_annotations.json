        "text": "t ventricle in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \nParathyroid adenoma manifested as pancreatitis and polyuria. Although the data used to explain a relationship between hyperparathyroidism and pancreatitis remain incomplete, there does appear to be a relationship between the two. We believe our patient's clinical course strongly supports this. \nDiffuse large cell lymphoma occurring in a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Evidence for the two different clones in Richter's syndrome. The authors report a 60-year-old man with Richter's syndrome, or diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) occurring in a patient with either chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Surface marker analysis revealed that the WM showed mu kappa surface immunoglobulin (Ig) chains, and that the DLCL showed mu lambda Ig chains. Flow cytometric DNA analysis demonstrated DNA content differences between WM and DLCL, the former diploid and the latter aneuploid. The current study suggests that Richter's syndrome derives from two independent B-cell malignancies. \nPharmacokinetics of oral and intravenous omeprazole in patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral and IV omeprazole after a single dose were studied in 9 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome to determine whether the increased dose required to control gastric acid hypersecretion could be explained on the basis of altered pharmacokinetics. Each patient was studied both after receiving a single IV bolus of omeprazole (40 mg) and after receiving a single oral dose of omeprazole (80 mg). Intravenous and oral omeprazole doses were administered 1 week apart. Gastric acid secretion and plasma concentrations of omeprazole after drug administration were determined in each patient. The area under the plasma concentration curve, clearance, and volume of distribution after IV omeprazole administration and the area under the plasma concentration curve, peak plasma concentration, and time required to reach the peak after oral omeprazole administration were not different from those reported previously for normal subjects and patients with peptic ulcer disease. Mean (+/- SEM) bioavailability of oral omeprazole for all patients was 68% +/- 16%, which was similar to the bioavailability reported previously for normal subjects. Three patients had a significantly lower bioavailability reported previously for normal subjects. Three patients had a significantly lower bioavailability (20% +/- 8%) than the others, and their basal acid outputs were significantly higher than those of the other 7 patients. For all patients there was an inverse correlation between bioavailability and basal acid output (r = 0.76; P less than 0.02). The mean (+/- SEM) elimination half-lives of IV and oral omeprazole were not different (2.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.5 hours) but were significantly longer than those reported previously for normal subjects (P less than 0.02). The duration of action correlated with the elimination half-life of the drug (r = 0.87; P less than 0.003) and area under the plasma concentration curve (r = 0.72; P less than 0.03). The mean durations of action of IV and oral omeprazole were not significantly different (34 +/- 7.2 vs. 35 +/- 6.2 hours). It was concluded that altered pharmacokinetics do not account for the increased drug requirement of omeprazole in patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In contrast to a previous study, the oral and IV omeprazole had the same duration of action, suggesting that intermittent bolus administration of parenteral omeprazole will obviate the need for continuous infusion of histamine H2-receptor antagonists in patients requiring parenteral antisecretory drugs. Furthermore, an IV dose every 12 hours controlled acid secretion in all patients, suggesting this as the recommended dose interval in patients requiring parenteral drug therapy. \nEmphysema type in relation to silica dust exposure in South African gold miners. The relationship between silica dust exposure in gold mines and the type of emphysema was studied in a group of 1,553 white gold miners who had undergone autopsy examination between 1974 and 1987. Of particular interest was the contrast between centriacinar and panacinar emphysema as they relate to silica exposure and the presence of silicosis. Subjects with significant emphysema, that is, with an emphysema score of 30% or more, were classified as having predominantly panacinar or predominantly centriacinar emphysema, and compared to those without emphysema (emphysema score less than or equal to 10%). Of those who had significant emphysema (greater than or equal to 30%), 24% had predominantly panacinar, 43% predominantly centriacinar, and 33% were classified as mixed. The odds ratios (OR) for the association between each emphysema type and dust exposure (one unit of the cumulative dust index) were found to be statistically significant and of equal magnitude [1.019, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.005 to 1.033 for panacinar and 1.019 with a 95% CI of 1.007 to 1.031 for centriacinar emphysema]. In 163 nonsmokers insignificant panacinar emphysema was more common than centriacinar emphysema. The results indicate that a miner with 20 yr in high-dust occupations has a 3.5 (1.7;6.6) times higher odds of having a significant degree of emphysema at autopsy than a miner not in a dusty occupation. This is likely to be true of smoking miners only because there were only four nonsmokers with an emphysema score between 30 and 40%. \nAge-related differences in hepatic drug clearance in children: studies with lorazepam and antipyrine. The disposition of intravenous antipyrine and lorazepam, administered as model substrates for hepatic oxidative metabolism and conjugation, was evaluated in 50 children (mean age, 7.8 years; range, 2.3 to 17.8 years) with acute lymphocytic leukemia in complete remission and compared with a group of ten healthy adults. Antipyrine clearance normalized to body weight was significantly greater in children than in adults (0.91 versus 0.59 ml/min/kg; p = 0.012), but was not different when normalized to body surface area. In contrast, lorazepam total clearance (CL) and unbound clearance (CLu) normalized to body weight were not significantly different between children and adults but were smaller in children when normalized to body surface area (CL = 31.9 versus 40.6 ml/min/m2, p = 0.036; CLu = 352 versus 485 ml/min/m2, p = 0.010). The mean lorazepam fraction unbound in children was 0.087, which was not different from adult volunteers (0.084). This study has identified significant differences between children and adults in the disposition of these two compounds, with higher milliliter per minute per kilogram clearance for antipyrine but not lorazepam. \nManagement of hypertension. Useful nonpharmacologic measures. Hypertension is a chronic problem commonly seen by primary care physicians. Inadequate treatment may result in significant morbidity and even death. Therefore, all patients with hypertension or at risk for hypertension should be educated about nonpharmacologic measures to control blood pressure. Weight reduction and sodium restriction are cornerstones of nonpharmacologic management of hypertension. Although studies of the effects of aerobic exercise on blood pressure are not well designed, data confirm the value of such exercise. Relaxation therapy has been shown to lower blood pressure, but effects may be transient. Potassium and calcium supplementation has lowered blood pressure, but because study results are contradictory, the exact clinical criteria for use of such supplements have not been determined. Vegetarians have lower blood pressure than nonvegetarians, but no specific dietary components (eg, fiber, fat) have been documented as the beneficial factors. Because of its significant pressor effect, alcohol should be avoided by hypertensives. A low-fat diet is recommended to decrease cardiovascular risk and assist in weight control. \nPulmonary dysfunction in surgical conditions of the newborn infant. OBJECTIVE: To describe the pathophysiology of surgical conditions that are associated with respiratory insufficiency in the newborn infant. DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: Newborn ICU in a children's hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-four newborn infants (1 to 28 days old) who required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for operative procedures or postoperative ventilatory support. INTERVENTIONS: Flow-volume curves obtained by manual inflation of the lungs, followed by forced deflation by negative pressure, and by passive expiration, under sedation and pharmacologic paralysis. MEASUREMENTS: Deflation flow-volume curves and passive expiratory curves were measured. Pulmonary function testing before and after bronchodilator administration (n = 11) began midway during the study period. Term and preterm groups served as controls. MAIN RESULTS: Forced vital capacity (FVC) was decreased in all groups with surgical disease as follows: abdominal wall defects and necrotizing enterocolitis groups to 48.3% and 62.1% that of preterm, respectively; pulmonary hypoplasia group to 55.5% that of term (p less than .05). Maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC decreased in all groups: abdominal wall defects and necrotizing enterocolitis group, to 36.8% and 37.9% that of preterm, respectively (p less than .05); pulmonary hypoplasia group, 20.0% that of term (p less than .05). The ratio of maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC divided by FVC was significantly decreased in necrotizing enterocolitis and pulmonary hypoplasia groups compared with that of preterm and term groups, respectively, but not in the abdominal wall defects group. Maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC, but not FVC, increased significantly (36%, p less than .05) after bronchodilator nebulization, indicating the presence of airway reactivity. Respiratory system compliance was decreased significantly (p less than .05) in all surgical disease groups compared with the term group. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchial reactivity contributes to decreased maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC, a feature also seen in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome who later develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Babies who require chronic ventilatory support after operation and who have developed reactive airways may benefit from the administration of bronchodilators during postoperative ventilatory management. \nAcute appendicitis. A 5-year review. A startling 31 per cent rate of perforated appendicitis in 1984 prompted a 5-year review at the Guthrie Medical Center. An increase over previous rates of 13 per cent and 0 per cent in 1964 and 1944 was confirmed in this study. Perforation accompanied 44 of 240 cases of appendicitis (18.3%); diagnostic accuracy in 295 cases undergoing operation was 81.4 per cent. Groups at risk for perforation were patients in the first decade of life (34.3% with perforations) and those over 50 years of age (48% perforated). Perforation rates were generally inversely related to accuracy. Accuracy was poorest in women in the second to fourth decade or those in the mid-portion of the menstrual cycle. When the appendix was not perforated, complications occurred in 8.7 per cent of patients while 29.5 per cent with a perforation had a complication. The mean hospital stay was prolonged by 2.5 days if the appendix was perforated. An increased awareness of the risk by both the public and physicians is essential to reduce the number of perforations. \nBenign hemorrhagic adrenocortical macrocysts in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. A new pseudotumorous lesion found in the adrenal cortex of six infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is described. These cystic masses were discovered either prenatally by using sonography or early in the neonatal period as palpable flank masses. Imaging studies, including sonography and CT, could not confidently exclude malignancy. After the masses were removed surgically, histologic examination showed them all to be benign hemorrhagic macrocysts within the capsule or permanent cortex (in contrast to neonatal adrenal hemorrhage, which usually occurs more centrally in the fetal cortex). The cysts were as large as 8 cm in diameter, and in one case a solitary cyst was predominant. Hemihypertrophy was present in all cases. Four of the six lesions were right-sided, and there was a male-female ratio of 5:1. Benign hemorrhagic adrenocortical macrocysts are a cause of abdominal mass in the fetus and neonate with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. \nShoulder impingement syndrome. A critical review. Impingement syndrome is an ill-defined term for a variety of disorders of the shoulder that manifest as anterior shoulder pain, especially during overhead activities. These disorders each have a common pathologic course that includes rotator cuff tendinitis (RCT), and, if untreated, may proceed to cuff rupture. RCT has at least two distinct etiologies. Primary impingement of the supraspinatus tendon on the coracoacromial arch is responsible in the majority of nonathletic cases. Overhead movements in sports are prone to developing secondary mechanical impingement because of an instability pattern that is common in this population. Information from this review and clinical practice permits differentiation of the two distinct etiologies of RCT which is important in treatment planning. Much work still needs to be done in defining the microscopic pathology of RCT. \nPropranolol pretreatment reduces cardiorespiratory toxicity due to plain, but not epinephrine-containing, intravenous bupivacaine in rats. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of pretreatment with propranolol on the cardio-respiratory toxicity of bupivacaine, either plain or with epinephrine 1:200,000 (5 micrograms.ml-1) added. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats, anaesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital, were divided into four groups. Groups I and III were pretreated with iv propranolol 150 micrograms.kg-1, and Groups II and IV received iv NS as a placebo. Three minutes later, rats in Groups I and II received plain 0.5% bupivacaine, 4 mg.kg-1, and Groups III and IV received 4 mg.kg-1 of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine, 5 micrograms.ml-1 iv. Five of eight rats pretreated with propranolol survived (Group I), compared with uniform fatality with NS pretreatment (Group II) (P less than 0.05). Addition of epinephrine to the bupivacaine eliminated the protective effect of propranolol. All rats pretreated with propranolol (Group III) or NS (Group IV) died when given bupivacaine with epinephrine. In conclusion, acute propranolol pretreatment reduced the fatal cardiotoxicity due to iv bupivacaine in male Sprague Dawley rats, but the addition of epinephrine 5 micrograms.ml-1 to bupivacaine eliminated the protective effect of propranolol. \nQuantification of valvular regurgitation by Doppler echocardiography. One of the widest uses of color Doppler echocardiography is for the quantification of valvular regurgitation. In this article we review the physics and instrumentation factors related to the most commonly applied method, that of planimetering areas of regurgitant jet spray within the receiving chamber, and relate features such as instrument gain, pulse repetition frequency, and important physical parameters such as receiving chamber compliance and driving pressure to the application of this method for precordial as well as transesophageal echocardiography. New approaches to the quantification of valvular insufficiency, such as measurement of the momentum of the jet and study of the acceleration flow in the proximal flow convergence region within the chamber of origin of an insufficiency jet and proximal to the orifice, are described and preliminary results given for a new method of quantification of volume flow across regurgitant orifices. \nEpidemiology of absence epilepsy: EEG findings and their predictive value. This population-based study of absence epilepsy comprised 97 children, ranging in age from newborns to 15 years. All had regular bilaterally synchronous and symmetric 2-4 Hz spike-and-slow wave discharges and absences with or without generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). Patients without GTCS tended to have long episodes of 2-4 Hz spike-and-slow wave discharges (greater than or equal to 10 sec), and simultaneous clinical correlates more frequently than those with GTCS. Posterior delta rhythm was found only in patients without GTCS. Focal abnormalities, albeit transient, were more frequent among patients with GTCS. The initial electroencephalogram was of some early predictive value in patients with only absences at the time of the initial registration. Brief episodes of 2-4 Hz spike-and-slow wave (less than 10 sec) without clinical correlates were associated with a slightly increased risk of future GTCS. \nTherapeutic adherence in the elderly: transdermal clonidine compared to oral verapamil for hypertension. This double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical trial, conducted in elderly patients with mild hypertension, compared adherence to treatment, efficacy, side effects, and quality of life during treatment with transdermal clonidine versus oral sustained-release verapamil (verapamil-SR). Blood pressure declined significantly--from 148/95 mm Hg at baseline to 139/84 after titration and 135/86 after maintenance--with transdermal clonidine (n = 29), and from 156/96 to 144/85 and 148/88, respectively, with verapamil-SR (n = 29). Adverse event rates and quality-of-life questionnaire responses were similar in the two treatment groups. Transdermal clonidine was worn as directed during more than 96% of patient-weeks of treatment. Compliance with the oral verapamil regimen was less consistent: Verapamil-SR was taken as directed during approximately 50% of patient-weeks of therapy, and individual compliance, assessed by tablet counts, varied from 50-120%. In all, 86% of subjects were satisfied or highly satisfied with the convenience of transdermal therapy; 87% reported that side effects were slightly or not bothersome; 65% indicated that transdermal patches were more convenient than oral therapy; and almost 60% preferred transdermal to oral therapy. In this study transdermal clonidine and oral verapamil were equally safe and effective. A substantial majority of patients preferred transdermal to oral therapy, and adherence to treatment was greater with transdermal therapy. \nEvaluation of the immune response in protection against experimental Streptococcus defectivus endocarditis. Immune protection from endocarditis caused by Streptococcus defectivus was examined by using a rabbit model. Previously we had demonstrated that immunization with nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS, now referred to as Streptococcus, species defectivus and adjacens) protected rabbits against endocarditis when they were challenged with the homologous strain. However, when high-titer immune globulin was transferred to nonimmunized rabbits, no protection was achieved. In the present study, immunosuppressive treatments were given to previously immunized rabbits, and alterations in the level of protection were determined by using the rabbit endocarditis model. Control-immunized rabbits as well as immunized rabbits receiving cyclosporin A or methylprednisolone treatments were protected from S. defectivus endocarditis at levels between 50% and 67%. Rabbits in each of these groups cleared S. defectivus organisms from the circulation by 3 hours after infection. Nitrogen mustard-treated rabbits (immunized or nonimmunized), however, were unable to clear S. defectivus organisms as efficiently (almost 100 times as many organisms in the blood when compared with other groups) by 3 hours, and all were susceptible to endocarditis. These data suggest that circulating phagocytes such as monocytes and granulocytes function to a certain extent in protection against S. defectivus endocarditis. Moreover, when neutrophils were transfused into granulocytopenic and monocytopenic rabbits, efficient clearance was prolonged, indicating that polymorphonuclear leukocytes were involved in the later (greater than 1 hour after infection) phase of protection. \nFibrin glue sealing of pancreatic injuries, resections, and anastomoses. Fibrin glue made with highly concentrated human fibrinogen and clotting factors was evaluated as a means of preventing pancreatic fistulas in 15 patients operated on for traumatic and nontraumatic conditions. Fibrin glue was applied directly to penetrating pancreatic injuries, pancreatic suture and staple lines in patients treated by partial resection, and pancreaticointestinal anastomoses. Postoperatively, no patient developed pancreatic fistulas, pancreatic abscesses, or pseudocysts. Fibrin glue sealing of pancreatic injuries, resections, and anastomoses may aid in preventing fistulas after pancreatic surgery. Additional potential uses include the sealing of pancreatic biopsy sites and occlusion of the pancreatic duct in pancreatic transplantation. \nImproving survival in gastric cancer: review of operative mortality in English language publications from 1970. In this review of English language publications from 1970, operative mortality following surgery for gastric cancer has been analysed. Operative mortality has declined in series reporting operations in successive decades to 1970, 1980 and 1990. Series reporting patients having surgery for gastric cancer in the decade to 1990 show a mean operative mortality rate of 7.8 per cent (median 4.6 per cent). This improvement may have contributed to the declining mortality rates for gastric cancer in the face of unchanging surgical workload. Results of operations for gastric cancer should be reported in a standard manner. \nChronic tuberculous empyema with bronchopleural fistula resulting in treatment failure and progressive drug resistance. We treated five patients with a past history of tuberculous pleural infection that led to chronic, quiescent, loculated empyema. Reactivation of TB was associated with formation of BPF and recovery of drug-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis from sputum. All patients had recurrence of positive sputum cultures that yielded tubercle bacilli resistant to drugs they were receiving. The lungs demonstrated gross thickening with calcification of both visceral and parietal pleura. Two patients underwent retreatment chemotherapy followed by decortication-empyemectomy and lung resection surgery; both are now culture-negative for TB. One patient received retreatment chemotherapy but refused surgery; he remains clinically stable with negative sputum cultures. Two other patients' organisms became drug-resistant and they remain sputum-culture positive. We believe that thick, calcified pleural walls limit penetration of drugs into the infected empyema space, resulting in suboptimal drug concentrations and drug resistance. Intensified chemotherapy and surgical intervention should be considered in these cases. \nProlonged QT interval and risk of sudden death in South-East Asian men. Sudden death in sleep occurs in substantial numbers among young men in South-East Asia. The frequencies of electrocardiographic abnormalities were measured in groups with varying risks of such sudden death. The mean heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater among 123 Laotian refugees in Thailand at high risk (405 [95% confidence interval 397-413] ms) than in 77 Laotian refugees in the United States at lower risk (364 [359-369] ms) and 199 non-Asian US residents at negligible risk (358 [354-362] ms). Among refugees in Thailand, prolonged QTc interval was associated with poor thiamine status and a history of seizure-like episodes in sleep. Thiamine deficiency may be a cause of prolonged QT interval and sudden death in this region. \nA variant of HLA-DR4 determines susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in a subset of Israeli Jews. HLA-DR4 is associated with risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in most populations. In Israeli Jews, in whom the Dw10 subtype of DR4 predominates, no association of RA with DR4 has been found. The inability to detect an association could be due to the high frequency of DR4-Dw10. We used DNA typing with amplification by the polymerase chain reaction and dot-blotting with allele-specific oligonucleotides to determine DR4 variants in 131 Jewish RA patients living in Israel and 134 controls. In both Ashkenazi Jews and non-Ashkenazi Jews, the rare variant Dw15 (previously identified in Japanese populations and in Japanese patients with RA) was found to be the main allele associated with the risk of developing RA (relative risk = 9.2, corrected P less than 0.001). However, this low-frequency allele could be responsible for susceptibility in only 11.5% of the patients. Susceptibility for rheumatoid factor-positive RA was associated with Dw4 and Dw15; the risk for rheumatoid factor-negative RA was associated only with Dw14. The distribution of the HLA-DQ alleles associated with DR4 showed that more than half of the RA patients with Dw15 also had HLA-DQw2. The frequencies of DQw7 and DQw8 were not different in RA patients compared with controls. The results suggest that, as in other populations, susceptibility for the development of RA in Israeli Jews is associated with DRB1 locus alleles of the DR4 group. \nFatigue and depression in brain-injured patients correlated with quadriceps strength and endurance. Many brain-injured (BI) patients complain of persistent fatigue that may alter their lifestyles. In order to assess muscular strength and endurance after brain injury, 22 BI men, greater than 9 months postinjury and aged 20 to 51 years, were separated into two groups based on a complaint of fatigue (fatigue n = 13, nonfatigue n = 9); each performed one maximal isometric knee extension at 60 degrees and 20 maximal isokinetic contractions at 20 rpm using a Cybex II dynamometer. A third group of age-matched, able-bodied men (n = 10) were used as controls. A battery of tests assessing the presence of fatigue (using a symptom checklist and two rating scales), depression, anxiety, and health status were given at the time of isokinetic/isometric testing. The mean fatigue rating, a subjective score, for the fatigue group of BI subjects was significantly worse than the other groups (p less than .01). There was a positive correlation between clinically significant Zung depression scores and fatigue rating (r = .46) and between Zung anxiety scores and fatigue rating. The depression scores for those who complained of fatigue were significantly higher than the other groups (p less than .005). Maximal isometric contractions were no different among the three groups. The mean maximal isokinetic torque during the 20 repetitions was greater in controls than in the BI groups, but did not reach statistical significance (p less than .25). There were no significant declines in isokinetic torque in the 20 repetitions for any of the groups, and the fatigue index was nearly equal for all three groups. \nCholedochal cysts: classification and cholangiographic appearance. A classification scheme for choledochal cysts is outlined and their appearance on cholangiograms is illustrated. Choledochal cysts are uncommon anomalies of the biliary system and are probably congenital in origin. They are manifested by cystic dilatation of the extra- or intrahepatic biliary tree or both. The classification system described here divides choledochal cysts into one of five main types. The most common, which is manifested by cystic or focal segmental dilatation of the common bile duct or fusiform choledochal dilatation, accounts for 80-90% of cases. \nExpression of a polymorphic epithelial mucin antigen defined by the monoclonal antibody BC2 in ovarian carcinoma. Use of the BC2 antibody for the detection of micrometastases. The BC2 monoclonal antibody, which binds to an epitope on the peptide backbone of polymorphic epithelial mucin, was tested immunohistochemically for reactivity with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. This epitope was expressed in 90 of 91 malignant ovarian tumors; in 88% of these, more than 50% of the tumor cells expressed the epitope. In 94% of the positive tumors, the epitope was expressed on the cell membrane; in 56%, cytoplasmic expression was evident; and in 39%, secreted extracellular antigen was detected. Differences were not clearly discernible between dissimilar histotypes with respect to the percentage of cells expressing antigen and antigen localization. Thirteen of 19 benign ovarian cystadenomas also expressed the epitope, but staining was weak and restricted to the luminal surface of the cell membrane. A blind retrospective immunohistochemical analysis of all second-look laparotomy biopsy specimens from 20 patients also was performed. All four patients in whom microscopic disease was detected by standard pathologic assessment had BC2-positive metastases. Of seven patients in whom recurrent disease subsequently developed despite negative pathologic findings, four had biopsy specimens containing BC2 antigen-positive adenocarcinoma-like cells. Of the nine patients with negative results on operation and no recurrence, one had biopsy specimens containing BC2 antigen-positive adenocarcinoma-like cells. Mesothelial cells, although typically negative, expressed the epitope in one biopsy specimen, necessitating caution in the interpretation of positive cells. The BC2 antibody is reactive with most epithelial ovarian carcinomas and appears to be a useful tool for the detection of micrometastases. \nMultivessel PTCA using the hugging balloon technique based on single guide catheter and dual balloon-on-a-wire systems. For percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of oversized arteries, often-times a satisfactory dilatation cannot be achieved with conventional balloon systems due to the unavailability of adequately sized balloons. This fact has contributed to a higher restenosis rate for this group of patients. We were able to obtain a satisfactory dilatation result in an oversized right coronary artery with a shepherd's crook configuration and eccentric anatomy at the origin using two balloon-on-a-wire systems and an Amplatz type guiding catheter. Although such favorable dilatation of an oversized artery using this \"hugging balloon technique\" can be expected, issues do exist such as difficult maneuverability and estimation of the balloon size obtained through simultaneous dual balloon inflation wherein size does not simply equal the sum of the two balloon catheters. It is hoped that there will be further improvements of the technique and development of new systems. At this time, however, it is felt that this is the most effective and reasonable strategy to achieve a high chance of success in oversized vessel lesions. \nComparison of the metabolic effects of continuous postoperative enteral feeding and feeding at night only. The effects of two different feeding patterns on oxygen consumption, nitrogen balance, blood biochemistry, and urinary catecholamine excretion were investigated over 5 d in patients after major head and neck surgery. Both groups of nine patients each were fed a regimen that provided 4.7 MJ on day 1 and 10 MJ on days 2-5 via a nasogastric tube by continuous infusion with an enteral feeding pump. One group was fed continuously for 24 h, the other was fed only at night, ie, from 1700 to 0900 the next morning. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher (P less than 0.01), nitrogen balance better (P less than 0.05), and urinary catecholamine excretion higher (P less than 0.05) in the 24-h-fed patients than in the night-fed patients. Postoperatively, feeding at night only is more energy efficient than is feeding continuously for 24 h, but is associated with poorer nitrogen balance. These differences may be mediated by sympathoadrenal mechanisms. \nNonhealing leg ulcers: a manifestation of basal cell carcinoma. Seven patients with basal cell carcinomas presenting as nonhealing ulcers are reported. The importance of considering malignancy and taking biopsy specimens of leg ulcers that fail to respond to treatment is emphasized. \nDiagnostic value of transesophageal compared with transthoracic echocardiography in infective endocarditis. To compare the diagnostic value of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography in infective endocarditis, paired transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiograms were obtained prospectively for 66 episodes of suspected endocarditis in 62 patients. Echocardiographic results were compared with the presence or absence of endocarditis determined by pathologic or nonechocardiographic data from the subsequent clinical course. All echocardiograms were interpreted by an observer told only that the studies were from patients in whom the diagnosis of endocarditis was suspected. The diagnosis of endocarditis was eventually made in 16 of the 66 episodes of suspected endocarditis (14 by pathologic and 2 by clinical criteria). In 7 of 16 transthoracic and 15 of 16 transesophageal echocardiograms, endocarditis was diagnosed at a probability level of \"almost certain,\" giving a sensitivity of 44% and 94%, respectively (p less than 0.01). For the remaining episodes, 49 of 50 transthoracic and all transesophageal studies yielded normal results, giving a specificity of 98% and 100%, respectively. This study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis and significantly more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography. Although echocardiography cannot rule out endocarditis, the high diagnostic sensitivity of transesophageal echocardiography results in a low probability of the disease when the study yields negative results in a patient with an intermediate likelihood of the disease. \nUhthoff's symptom in optic neuritis: relationship to magnetic resonance imaging and development of multiple sclerosis. Eighty-one patients with a first attack of isolated optic neuritis, 40 with Uhthoff's symptom (Group 1) and 41 without (Group 2), were studied. All had a neurovisual examination, 74 of 81 patients had the pattern visual evoked potential recorded at rest, and 43 had magnetic resonance imaging brain scans. The pattern visual evoked potential P100 latency was prolonged, Group 1 with a mean of 136 +/- 19 msec. Group 2 with a mean of 131 +/- 19 msec (control subjects, 102 +/- 5 msec; n = 84), and the P100 amplitude was reduced, without significant difference between the groups. Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging scans were present in significantly more patients in Group 1 (p less than 0.025). Treatment of optic neuritis with corticosteroids had no effect on the evolution or duration of Uhthoff's symptom. Overall, 35 of 81 (43%) patients, followed for a mean of 3.5 years, developed multiple sclerosis. The incidence was significantly greater in Group 1 (p less than 0.01). Uhthoff's symptom also correlated with a higher incidence of recurrent optic neuritis. We conclude that Uhthoff's symptom is a prognostic indicator for the early development of multiple sclerosis. \nProstatic abscess due to histoplasma capsulatum in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We report a case of prostate abscess due to Histoplasma capsulatum in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The diagnosis and management are discussed, and the literature is reviewed. \nMalignancy and chronic wounds: Marjolin's ulcer. Malignancy in chronic wounds is not uncommon and has been reported as occurring in chronic scars of diverse causes. We report an unusual case of bilateral thermal injuries of the lower extremities that 40 years later presented as very large, painful, fungating wounds of both lower legs. After histologic confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma, eradication of the disease required amputations of both the lower extremities and reconstructive procedures. In addition, we discuss current theories regarding the mechanism of malignant degeneration in chronic wounds and evaluate treatment on the basis of information currently available in the literature. \nIsolated atrial infarction in a patients with single vessel disease of the sinus node artery. Atrial infarction is found in approximately 17 percent of autopsy-proven cases of myocardial infarction, but is a frequently missed clinical diagnosis. The antemortem diagnosis of atrial infarction occurring in the absence of ventricular infarction has not been previously reported. We present a patient with ischemic chest discomfort associated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Electrocardiographic and enzymatic changes were consistent with atrial infarction. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated single vessel critical stenosis at the origin of the sinus node artery. Combined atrial and ventricular infarction occurs frequently and should be considered in the setting of paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias occurring early in the course of ventricular myocardial infarction. Lone atrial infarction is a rare but distinct clinical entity. The tetrad of typical ischemic chest discomfort, paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia, P-Ta segment shifts, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels without evidence for ventricular infarction strongly suggests isolated atrial infarction. \nDietary adjustments and nutritional therapy during treatment for oral-pharyngeal dysphagia. Dietary adjustments are an important part of the therapy for dysphagia. Once dysphagia is diagnosed, the patient must be nourished safely while being taught therapeutic and compensatory strategies for dealing with the swallowing disorder. The patient's nutritional status must be maintained despite any limitations on oral intake. Liquids may be thickened and the consistency of solid foods may be adjusted to ensure an adequate diet that is safe for the patient. When the patient cannot eat safely or take adequate amounts of food orally, an alternative feeding method should be instituted. \nReproductive and menstrual factors and risk of peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis. OBJECTIVE: Between 1987 and 1989 data were collected to evaluate risk factors for pelvic endometriosis. DESIGN: A case-control study was conducted on 241 cases with laparoscopically or laparotomically confirmed peritoneal or ovarian endometriosis consecutively admitted to three teaching hospitals in Northern Italy. The control group consisted of 437 women admitted to hospitals for acute conditions covering similar catchment areas. RESULTS: Compared with nulliparous women, the risk of endometriosis decreased with increasing number of births: the point estimates were 0.4 and 0.3, respectively, for those with one and two or more births (X2(1) trend = 50.3, P less than 0.001). No relation emerged with age at first birth and spontaneous miscarriages. Relative to women whose menarche occurred at age 11 or younger, the risk of endometriosis was slightly lower in those who experienced later menarche, but the trend in risk was not significant. Women with irregular menstrual cycles showed a lower frequency of the disease (relative risk, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.5). The role of various factors was largely similar for different disease locations (ovary, peritoneum, and both) and indication for diagnostic surgery (sterility, pelvic pain, and other reasons). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that parity and irregular/long menses lower the risk of endometriosis. These findings were similar in different subgroups of disease location and indication for surgery, giving strong evidence of the consistency of the general results. \nBenign arterial dissections of the posterior circulation. Four young adults with spontaneous dissection of the vertebrobasilar system are reported. Clinically, two patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and two with brain-stem ischemia. In two cases of ruptured arterial dissection of the posterior cerebral artery, angiography demonstrated fusiform and \"sausage-like\" dilatation of the involved vessel. In two cases of occlusive dissection of the basilar artery, angiography revealed the typical \"string sign.\" All four patients were treated conservatively: three survive in good clinical condition and one remains disabled. Follow-up angiograms showed spontaneous healing of the lesion with return to an almost normal arterial configuration in two cases; residual narrowing corresponding to the dissection was the most notable finding in the other two. It is recommended that, in a subset of neurologically stable patients, angiographic monitoring is undertaken to assess the tendency for spontaneous repair before surgical intervention is planned. \nCystoscopic suction diathermy for the treatment of superficial bladder tumours. The treatment of superficial bladder tumours (Ta, T1) is a time-consuming exercise for urological surgeons and patients. A method of treating the tumours, whether primary or recurrent, by endoscopic suction diathermy has been developed. The technique significantly reduces the amount of tumour debris within the bladder during treatment as well as the amount of diathermy employed. By removing the free tumour cells in the irrigation fluid the risk of tumour cell implantation may be kept to a minimum. \nRight ventricular pacing and left ventricular filling pattern. An echo-Doppler study. The influence of right ventricular pacing on left ventricular filling has not been completely clarified. The aim of the study was to analyze the possible alteration in and effects on left ventricular filling resulting from right ventricular pacing. The study population consisted of two groups; group A was comprised of 12 patients with a spontaneous left bundle branch block, and group B had 12 patients without left bundle branch block. All the patients underwent an interrogation of the mitral valve inflow by Doppler echocardiography, in order to measure isovolumic relaxation time, early and late peak velocity (E and A wave), E/A ratio and deceleration time. The study was performed at spontaneous rhythm and after, inhibition of the pacemaker. In group A, there were no changes in the Doppler parameters when passing from a spontaneous to an 80/min electrically induced rhythm. Analysis of group B revealed a statistically significant lengthening of IVR and Dec t with electrical stimulation. No statistically significant differences were found when we compared the Doppler parameters of the two populations at the same pacing frequency. Right ventricular pacing causes interventricular asynchrony and abnormalities in diastolic filling times, which resulted in a lengthening of either IVR and Dec t, simulating a pattern of abnormal relaxation. \nPreoperative segmental localization of hepatic metastases: utility of three-dimensional CT during arterial portography. To evaluate the accuracy of a fast three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique in determining the segmental location of hepatic metastases, 14 patients (40 metastases) were prospectively investigated before surgery with dynamic two-dimensional (2D) computed tomography during sequential arterial portography (CTAP). All patients underwent subsequent hepatic tumor resection within 4 days. After computer-generated mapping of hepatic venous structures with high attenuation and metastases with low attenuation, 3D reconstruction was performed. Thirty-six of the 40 lesions (90%) were detected with 2D and 3D CTAP. The accuracy in determining the segmental location of hepatic metastases was 78% (28 of the 36 metastases) for 2D CTAP and 94% (34 of the 36 metastases) for 3D CTAP. The difference in localization rates between 2D CTAP and 3D CTAP was statistically significant. The 3D CTAP technique provides vital data unattainable with other imaging modalities that improve the preoperative assessment of the resectability of hepatic metastases and allows planning a safer surgical approach. \nChorea-acanthocytosis: abnormal composition of covalently bound fatty acids of erythrocyte membrane proteins. Phospholipid class, peak profile of each phospholipid class, loosely bound fatty acids, covalently (tightly) bound fatty acids of the erythrocyte membranes, and plasma fatty acids were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography in six patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and 14 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects. Additionally, six patients with Huntington's disease were included as disease control subjects in the study of covalently bound fatty acids. Study of covalently (tightly) bound fatty acids in erythrocyte membrane proteins after alkaline hydrolysis, hitherto undescribed in chorea-acanthocytosis, revealed that palmitic acid (C16:0) was significantly increased and stearic acid (C18:0) was decreased in the patients with chorea-acanthocytosis. Analyses for total covalently bound fatty acids disclosed that palmitic and docosahexaenoic (C22:6) acids were increased and stearic acid was decreased in chorea-acanthocytosis. Phospholipid class (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylserine) and peak profile of each phospholipid class from the erythrocyte membranes did not differ between the patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and the control subjects. Of the loosely bound fatty acids, linoleic acid (C18:2) was significantly decreased in those with chorea-acanthocytosis, which seemed to be nonspecific. \nThe anterior inferior cerebellar artery in the internal auditory canal. It has been proposed that compression of the auditory and vestibular nerve trunks by vascular loops might be the cause of otherwise unexplained hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo, as well as Meniere's disease. We studied the human temporal bone histological collection at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary to determine whether audiovestibular symptoms could be correlated with the presence of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery within the internal auditory canal. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops were found within the internal auditory canals of 12.3% of 1327 temporal bones, about half the number found when preparations with intact brains are studied. This difference can be attributed to avulsion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery during removal of the brain at autopsy. There were 5 cases of unexplained unilateral hearing loss with anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops: 3 in the opposite ear and 2 in both ears. There were 2 cases with unilateral unexplained tinnitus with anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops: 1 in the involved ear and 1 in the opposite ear. A case with bilateral tinnitus had an anterior inferior cerebellar artery loop in 1 ear. There were 29 cases of vertigo with no peripheral histopathological correlate or central nervous system disorder; anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops were found in the internal auditory canals of 7 (12.5%) of the 56 ears in this group, which is not significantly different from the 12.3% incidence recorded for the entire collection. In 23 cases of unilateral Meniere's disease, there were anterior inferior cerebellar artery loops in the hydropic ears in 3, the opposite ear in 1, and both ears in 1. We can find no correlation between unexplained hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, or Meniere's disease and the presence of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery in the internal auditory canal. \nThe I-Abm12 mutation, which confers resistance to experimental myasthenia gravis, drastically affects the epitope repertoire of murine CD4+ cells sensitized to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Susceptibility to experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), which is induced in mice by injection of purified Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (TAChR), is influenced by the I-A locus products, which restrict presentation of AChR Th epitopes. The bm12 mutation of the I-Ab molecule in the C57BL/6 strain, which is highly susceptible to EAMG, yields the EAMG resistant mutant B6.C-H-2bm12 (bm12). We investigated here the consequences of the bm 12 mutation on the CD4+ response to the TAChR alpha subunit. Upon immunization with TAChR, CD4+ cells became sensitized to TAChR and anti-AChR antibodies were produced in both bm12 and C57BL/6 strains. Overlapping synthetic peptides, corresponding to the complete sequence of TAChR alpha subunit, were used to identify Th epitopes. CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice recognized peptides T alpha 150-169, T alpha 181-200, and T alpha 360-378. CD4+ cells from bm12 mice did not respond to any synthetic sequence. Upon injection of the three C57BL/6 Th epitope peptides, either individually or as a pool, CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice recognized each peptide and TAChR. Therefore they recognized epitopes similar or identical to those originated from TAChR processing. CD4+ cells from bm12 mice injected with the same peptides responded to T alpha 360-378 strongly, to a lesser extent to T alpha 181-200, never to peptide T alpha 150-169. Only CD4+ cells sensitized against the T epitope peptide T alpha 181-200 responded to TAChR. We tested if lack of response to T alpha 150-169, and the low response to T alpha 181-200, was due to inability of the I-Abm12 molecule to present the T epitope peptides. bm12 and C57BL/6 APC were used to present the T epitope peptides to specifically sensitized CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice. All T epitope peptides were presented by bm12 APC, although T alpha 150-169 was presented less efficiently than by C57BL/6 APC. Resistance to EAMG induced by the bm12 mutation may be due to the change in the epitope repertoire of AChR-specific Th cells, and lack of recognition of otherwise immunodominant Th epitopes. For at least one epitope this might be due to absence of potentially reactive, specific CD4+ clones. \nIn vivo T-cell activation by staphylococcal enterotoxin B prevents outgrowth of a malignant tumor. Treatment of T cells with staphylococcal enterotoxins in vitro is known to activate T cells in a subset restricted manner based on beta-chain variable region (V beta) gene expression. In particular, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) activates T cells bearing V beta 7 or V beta 8. We examined the ability of SEB to activate T cells in vivo. Treatment of C3H mice with doses of SEB ranging from 5 to 250 micrograms resulted in a dose-dependent activation of V beta 8+ T cells as reflected by increased interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) expression, proliferation to exogenous IL-2 and allogeneic cells, and production of gamma interferon. SEB also caused proliferation of the CD8+ subset of V beta 8+ cells in vivo. Thus, T-cell activation by SEB in vivo appears to be specific since V beta 2+ cells (non-SEB reactive) did not show increases in IL-2R expression similar to those seen with V beta 8+ cells nor did they proliferate. We then studied the ability of these activated cells to potentiate the immune response to a malignant progressor tumor. Treatment of C3H mice with 50 micrograms of SEB at the time of inoculation with tumor fragments resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the frequency of tumor outgrowth. These data demonstrate that treatment of C3H mice with SEB results in specific activation of V beta 8+ cells in vivo and that these activated cells are capable of preventing the outgrowth of a malignant tumor. \nValue of follow-up procedures in patients with large-cell lymphoma who achieve a complete remission. Salvage therapy for relapsed large-cell lymphoma (LCL) is more effective in patients with minimal disease, suggesting that early detection of relapse might increase the chance of long-term survival. To determine whether current follow-up procedures are effective in identifying preclinical disease, we analyzed patterns of relapse in 139 LCL patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) with high/moderate-dose methotrexate with leucovorin, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (M/m-BACOD). The timing and results of all posttreatment follow-up tests were examined in the 36 patients who relapsed from complete remission (CR) and 46 controls who remain in CR. Despite conscientious posttreatment follow-up, only two of the 36 relapses (6%) were detected before the development of symptoms. Sixty-seven percent of patients relapsed in new disease sites (42% in new and old sites, and 25% in new sites only). Consistent with this observation, the tests most sensitive to clinical relapse were those not targeted to specific sites of disease: gallium scan (sensitivity, 90%), physical examination (80%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (65%). Of screening tests performed, only LDH was successful in detecting preclinical relapse, with a sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 85% for impending symptomatic relapse. These results indicate that conventional screening was ineffective in detecting preclinical relapse in LCL patients. We recommend prospective evaluation of a strategy that (1) screens with a frequency appropriate to a patient's risk of relapse, (2) uses sensitive test(s) not targeted to specific sites, and (3) limits aggressive screening to those high-risk patients eligible for potentially curative salvage therapy. \nAcute monarticular arthritis. Sleuthing out the cause. The diagnosis of acute monarthritis depends heavily on a thorough history and physical examination. When these are combined with a few diagnostic tests, such as synovial fluid analysis, x-ray studies, complete blood cell count, and common blood chemical analyses, the majority of cases can be correctly diagnosed and properly treated. \nOccult breast masses: use of a mammographic localizing grid for US evaluation. To determine if there was a problem of misidentification of mammographically detected masses with freehand ultrasound (US), the authors examined 50 mammographically distinct masses in 47 patients who were scheduled to undergo needle localization. In only six cases were the masses to be localized in an area of the breast that contained other mammographic opacities that could have led to problems of identification. The patients were first studied with freehand US. Results were then compared with those subsequently obtained with a fenestrated mammographic compression grid to guide the US evaluation. Needle localization was then performed. In five of 50 cases, masses detected with freehand US and initially believed to correspond to the mammographically detected mass were subsequently found to represent different areas of the breast when US was used with the compression grid. These results suggest that the potential for misidentification of masses with freehand US is real and that a mammographic grid localization device can be used to overcome this problem. \nNew trends in gallstone management. Many new therapies for the management of gallstone disease have been pioneered in the past decade. The object of this review is to equip the surgeon with the answers to all of the questions a patient will ask about gallstone therapy; the review is therefore didactic as well as comprehensive. \nAcute asthma. Admission chest radiography in hospitalized adult patients. The utility of admission chest radiography has been controversial in the management of adult patients admitted to the hospital with acute asthma. We reviewed the impact of admission chest radiography on in-hospital management of 54 adult patients with acute asthma. Each patient was admitted after a failed 12-h course of bronchodilator therapy in the emergency ward. Major radiographic abnormalities were found in 20 (34 percent) of 58 occasions. These abnormalities included focal parenchymal opacities, IIM, enlarged cardiac silhouette, pulmonary vascular congestion, new solitary pulmonary nodule and pneumothorax. Subsequent antibiotic use correlated with radiographic focal opacities or IIM, even in afebrile patients, but did not correlate with elevated blood leukocyte count. Based on the evidence of in-hospital alteration of management independent of elevated blood leukocyte count and body temperature, we recommend that chest radiographs be obtained for all adult patients admitted because of acute asthma. \nIdentification of different laminin binding proteins in basolateral cell membranes of human colorectal carcinomas and normal colonic mucosa. The adhesive properties of tumour cells to laminin, the major glycoprotein of basement membranes, play a crucial part in the complex process of tumour invasion and metastasis. We therefore investigated the expression of laminin binding proteins in isolated basolateral cell membranes of human colorectal carcinomas and the adjacent normal colonic mucosa. Cell membrane binding assays and immunoblotting experiments showed appreciable quantitative and qualitative differences in the expression of these proteins in neoplastic and normal tissue. Epithelial basolateral cell membranes of colorectal carcinomas bound five to eight times more radioactive labelled laminin than basolateral cell membranes of the adjacent normal colonic epithelium. The expression of laminin binding proteins with Mr 66,000-69,000 daltons corresponding to the so called 'Mr 67,000 dalton laminin receptor' was three to four times higher in colorectal carcinomas than in normal colonic epithelium. In addition, laminin binding proteins with higher molecular weights, which may be related to the family of integrins, were also increased in colorectal carcinomas. In particular, laminin binding proteins with Mr 180,000 daltons were exclusively expressed on neoplastic epithelial cells of human colorectal carcinomas. Our data suggest that certain classes of laminin binding proteins may be selectively expressed on colonic tumour cells, leading to an increased capacity for migration, invasion, and metastasis. \nHyperthermia deaths in Finland in 1970-86. All cases in which hyperthermia had been determined as the basic cause of death during the period 1970-86 were collected from the records of the Central Statistical Office of Finland. Of the total of 230 cases, 228 were included in the present study; the two remaining victims died abroad, and no autopsy was performed in Finland. Most of the hyperthermia deaths occurred while the decedent was taking a sauna bath; most decedents were men aged 42-62 years. An increase in the total number of hyperthermia deaths, and of male victims, was noted from the beginning of the 1970s onward; the number of female victims remained at a relatively steady level throughout, with the exception of a slight rise in 1986. Acute alcohol consumption was detected in most of the victims; in some cases there was also a reference to chronic alcoholism or recent long-term heavy drinking. The findings suggest that in addition to the acute hazardous effect of ethanol on thermoregulatory mechanisms, the long-term consumption of alcohol may have promoted fatal hyperthermia in these subjects. \nSocioeconomic status and morbidity and mortality in hypertensive blacks. Despite an overall limited range of social and economic opportunities in the recent past, blacks of lower socioeconomic status have experienced marked excesses in hypertension-related burdens compared with their more advantaged peers: the incidence, prevalence, and severity of hypertension and its end-organ sequelae increased with decreasing educational achievement and the 5-year mortality was two times higher for black hypertensives of lower than higher educational achievement under conditions of usual care in U.S. communities in the 1970s. The Stepped Care program of antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy of the HDFP reduced all-cause mortality by 19% for black hypertensive men and 28% for black women. The HDFP also eliminated the association of mortality with educational achievement; the favorable impact of the program was greatest in the group at highest risk, blacks of lowest socioeconomic status. \nDiagnostic usefulness of renal scanning after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [editorial] Radioisotopic renal scanning after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) has proven to be an exciting area for research. The biologic activity of markers such as DTPA and hippuran, when combined with the physiological effects of ACEI, may provide noninvasive methods of diagnosing both renal artery stenosis and renovascular hypertension. Recent investigators have demonstrated that the sensitivities and specificities of these tests may vary widely; these differences are probably due to variations in study design, patient population, diagnostic criteria, and outcome measurements. We have reviewed these studies and discuss these possible sources of variation and their impact on the clinical usefulness of these diagnostic tests, especially in relation to the prevalence of disease in the population. Current results suggest that the post-ACEI DTPA scan is relatively accurate in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, with sensitivity generally greater than 90% and specificity around 95%. However, the best results in predicting the response to angioplasty or surgery in patients with renal artery stenosis have been with the use of post-ACEI hippuran in combination with furosemide (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 95%). With confirmation of these findings and continued investigation, it is expected that accurate noninvasive tests will be available for widespread clinical use in the near future. \nPrevention of cisplatin-induced emesis: a double-blind multicenter randomized crossover study comparing ondansetron and ondansetron plus dexamethasone. Ondansetron (OND) is a new 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that give complete protection from emesis/nausea in approximately 50% of cisplatin (CDDP)-treated patients. To evaluate if dexamethasone (DEX) added to OND increases antiemetic efficacy, we carried out a double-blind randomized crossover study to compare the antiemetic activity of OND with OND plus DEX. One hundred two chemotherapy-naive patients (44 women and 58 men) scheduled to receive CDDP chemotherapy at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2 entered the study. Eighty-nine patients completed both cycles with the following results: complete protection from emesis/nausea was obtained in 57/59 patients (64.0%/66.3%) with OND and in 81/79 (91.0%/88.8%) with OND plus DEX (P = .0005/P = .0021). At the end of the study, 53% of the patients expressed a treatment preference, and of these, 74% chose OND plus DEX compared with 26% who preferred OND alone, a statistically significant difference (P less than .003). Side effects were very mild and not significantly different between the two treatments. We conclude that OND plus DEX is more efficacious than OND in protecting patients from CDDP-induced emesis and nausea. \nAutoimmune MRL-1 pr/1pr mice are an animal model for the secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus often develop thrombosis, recurrent abortion, thrombocytopenia and neurological disease, in association with serum antibodies against phospholipids, termed the secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. In our search for an animal model for the human antiphospholipid syndrome, we examined the MRL-1pr/pr mouse, which develops a lupus-like illness. These mice were found to have significantly elevated levels of serum antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and thrombocytopenia compared to normal mice. By immunodiffusion, these antibodies are similar to human aPL. We observed histologic evidence of central nervous system thromboses as well as perivascular infiltrates of the choroid plexus. The high titers of serum aPL, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis establish this strain as an animal model for the secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. \nEffects of splenectomy on pulmonary metastasis and growth of SC42 carcinoma transplanted into mouse liver. The carcinoma SC42 was transplanted into the liver of its syngeneic mice DS, and the immunological integrity of the spleen and the effects of splenectomy on the growth and pulmonary metastasis of the liver tumor were assessed. On day 7 after liver tumor transplantation, the natural killer (NK) activity of the splenocytes was significantly elevated; it subsequently decreased at a later stage of the tumor. The response of the splenocytes to PHA and Con-A decreased significantly from the early stage of the tumor. However, the mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell reaction increased significantly from day 14 to day 28. The survival rate of the mice, which had undergone simultaneous splenectomy and liver tumor transplantation, was significantly lower than that of sham-operated control mice. The number of pulmonary metastases in splenectomized mice was significantly greater than in the control mice. There was, however, no difference between the two groups in the weight of the liver tumor. By contrast, splenectomies performed 14 days before or 14 days after tumor transplantation had no significant influence on the survival of the mice. Splenectomies performed on day 0 and on day 3 after tumor transplantation significantly increased the number of pulmonary metastases. Furthermore, the intravenous injection of anti-asialo GM1 antisera on day 0 and day 3 significantly increased the number of pulmonary metastases, but injection of anti-Thy 1.2 antisera had no effect. These results suggest that splenic NK cells may play an important role in the suppression of pulmonary metastasis at early stages of the liver tumor. \nSerum endorphin levels in injured children. Plasma beta-endorphin levels (PBEL) are known to be elevated in acutely injured adults, but this has not been studied in pediatric patients with trauma. We measured PBEL in 46 children who sustained blunt injury. The mean acute PBEL was significantly elevated compared with the mean convalescent PBEL (40.5 +/- 29.0 versus 5.4 +/- 2.1 picomoles per liter, p less than 0.05). PBEL were highest in patients with multiple injuries (60.5 +/- 33.2 picomoles per liter, n = 16). PBEL were also elevated with isolated injuries of the head, face or limbs, and even with less severe injuries, namely multiple abrasions. PBEL were low in patients with abdominal (two patients) or spinal (two patients) injuries. Convalescent PBEL were consistently low. Severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] of more than ten) had significantly elevated PBEL compared with patients with minor injuries (ISS less than 10), but some children with low ISS had elevated PBEL. The presence of head injury did not influence PBEL and there was no correlation between PBEL and systolic blood pressure. We have demonstrated that the PBEL is elevated in pediatric patients with trauma. \nBehavioral complications of drug treatment of Parkinson's disease. A variety of neuropharmacologic agents, including anticholinergic drugs, amantadine hydrochloride, levodopa, selegiline, bromocriptine, and pergolide, are now available for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Of patients treated with dopaminergic agents, 30% develop visual hallucinations, 10% exhibit delusions, 10% have euphoria, 1% have mania, 10% to 15% experience increased anxiety, 15% have confusional periods, and a few exhibit altered sexual behavior. Anticholinergic drugs have a greater tendency to produce confusional states than dopaminergic compounds. Elderly patients and those with underlying dementia are most likely to have untoward side effects with anti-parkinsonism treatment. Dosage reduction is the optimum management strategy, although anti-psychotic agents may be necessary in patients with delusions, and lithium may help control drug-induced mania. Dopaminergic agents share the property of stimulation of D2 dopamine receptors, and this action may play an essential role in mediating their neuropsychiatric effects. \nPredicting radioresistance in early glottic squamous cell carcinoma by DNA content. Nuclear DNA content has been implicated as a prognostic factor in an increasing number of tumor types. Current data on the role of DNA content in head and neck carcinoma are conflicting and incomplete. To evaluate the role of DNA content in predicting radioresistance, 29 patients with T1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx who had undergone uniform curative radiotherapy and whose clinical outcome was known had flow cytometric analysis for DNA content performed on their tumors with paraffin-embedded archival tissues. Five aneuploid lesions and 24 diploid lesions were identified. All aneuploid lesions occurred in radioresistant tumors. The probability of an aneuploid tumor failing radiotherapy was highly significant at p = .016. No DNA discordance was found in a sampling of half of the radioresistant lesions' pretreatment and recurrent specimens, for a 100% predictive value of moderate statistical power. On the basis of these findings, patients with aneuploid T1 glottic lesions should be referred for primary surgical therapy. \nEvaluation and management of patients with both peripheral vascular and coronary artery disease. The prevalence of serious angiographic coronary artery disease ranges from 37% to 78% in patients undergoing operation for peripheral vascular disease. Clinical studies have demonstrated that cardiac outcome after peripheral vascular surgery is not adequately predicted by the standard criteria of history, physical findings and rest electrocardiogram. An adequate exercise work load, left ventricular function and thallium redistribution have proved important in perioperative risk stratification. The choice of a perioperative functional cardiac test depends on patient-related factors and the nature of the peripheral vascular operation. Although procedures involving aortic cross-clamping exert a greater hemodynamic stress than do carotid endarterectomy and femoral popliteal surgery, late cardiac morbidity and mortality are significant in all patients with atherosclerotic disease. The decision to proceed with preoperative coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization should be based primarily on indications independent of the peripheral vascular procedure. However, peripheral vascular surgery may influence the timing of myocardial revascularization. Patients with high risk or unstable coronary artery disease may benefit from preoperative coronary revascularization, although this hypothesis remains unproved. In all patients, careful monitoring during and after operation is essential. All patients with peripheral vascular disease should be considered to be at lifelong risk for fatal and nonfatal cardiac events and should undergo appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation and be treated accordingly. \nVulvar squamous cell carcinoma and papillomaviruses: two separate entities? Vulvar squamous precancers (vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia) are associated with sexual factors, cigarette smoking, and human papillomaviruses. However, epidemiologic studies of invasive carcinoma of the vulva have produced conflicting evidence for these associations, in part because of a strong association with vulvar inflammatory disease (dystrophies) in older women. We analyzed a series of 42 vulvar invasive carcinomas for papillomavirus nucleic acids by deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid in situ hybridization and correlated their presence with age, smoking history, and morphologic type. The carcinomas were divided into well-differentiated, moderately and poorly differentiated, and intraepithelial-like growth patterns, the latter composed of nests of invasive neoplastic epithelium with preserved cell polarity, similar to intraepithelial disease. Of the lesions studied, 28% were human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid-positive. Intraepithelial-like neoplasms segregated in women with a younger mean age (64 versus 73 years) than that of women with conventional squamous cell carcinoma and they more frequently had a history of cigarette smoking (88% versus 28%). Moreover, intraepithelial-like lesions contained human papillomavirus nucleic acids more frequently (67% versus 13%) when analyzed by in situ hybridization. These observations confirm the diverse nature of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma and may explain in part why conflicting results are obtained from studies investigating the role of sexual and viral factors in the genesis of vulvar cancer. They suggest that many invasive vulvar cancers may not be linked to papillomaviruses. \nIs there a premorbid personality typical for Parkinson's disease? For decades clinicians have postulated a characteristic preexisting personality in patients who develop Parkinson's disease (PD). They are described as moralistic, law-abiding, conscientious, and averse to risk-taking. The limited personality surveys tend to be confirmatory, but most of the literature is anecdotal or replete with unprovable psychodynamic postulates. In addition to an apparent stability of marriages and lack of alcoholism, patients with PD are less likely than controls to be smokers. It has been suggested that nicotine and its byproducts are not actually protective against PD, and it could be postulated that higher-than-average intrinsic dopamine may facilitate addiction. Smoking for the patient who is later to develop PD may be particularly unrewarding. In addition, the postulated personality for PD may predispose to hard work, perspiration, and increased exposure to putative trace elements in the water supply. \nParalysis of the trapezius: a case report. A patient was referred to physical therapy for exercises to the right shoulder secondary to a peripheral nerve injury involving the spinal accessory nerve. A treatment program was designed to accommodate for lack of upward scapula rotation, which is necessary for elevation of the upper extremity above shoulder level. During the course of two and a half years of care, a variety of associated problems were encountered. There was no apparent nerve regeneration, and the patient was left with limited mobility of the affected upper extremity. \nRandomised, controlled trial of effectiveness of ampicillin in mild acute respiratory infections in Indonesian children. The recommended treatment for mild acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children is supportive care only, but many physicians, especially in developing countries, continue to prescribe antibiotic treatment because they believe it prevents progression to more severe ARI. To find out whether ampicillin treatment conferred any benefit over supportive care alone, a randomised, controlled trial was carried out among 889 children (under 5 years) with mild ARI in Indonesia. 447 were randomly allocated ampicillin (25-30 mg/kg body weight three times daily for 5 days) plus supportive care (continued breastfeeding, clearing of the nose, and paracetamol to control fever); 442 were allocated supportive care only. The treatment groups were almost identical after randomisation in terms of age, sex, level of parental education, history of measles immunisation, and fever. After 1 week the percentages cured were nearly identical (204 [46%] ampicillin; 209 [47%] control), as were the percentages of cases progressing to moderate ARI (56 [13%] vs 53 [12%]). The effect of treatment was not modified by age, sex, measles immunisation status, or the educational level of the parents. At the 2-week follow-up, the percentages cured were 62% (277) in the ampicillin group and 58% (256) in the control group; 14% of both groups had progressed to moderate ARI; and 24% (107) and 28% (123), respectively, still had mild ARI. None of the differences in outcome between the ampicillin and control groups was statistically significant. Thus, ampicillin plus supportive care offers no benefit over supportive care alone for treatment of mild ARI in young Indonesian children. \nPrevention of gram-positive infections after bone marrow transplantation by systemic vancomycin: a prospective, randomized trial. Gram-positive bacteria are the most commonly isolated organisms after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and severe streptococcus septicemia has been reported. In order to evaluate the benefit of a gram-positive prophylaxis after BMT, we conducted a prospective, randomized trial of systemic vancomycin among 60 patients undergoing BMT for hematologic malignancies. Patients were randomized to receive (n = 30) or not receive (n = 30) prophylactic vancomycin 15 mg/kg every 12 hours from day -2 until resolution of neutropenia or until the first episode of fever. All patients were treated in laminar air-flow rooms, received sterile diet, total gut decontamination, and had central venous catheters placed surgically. Vancomycin was found to be highly effective in preventing gram-positive infections that occurred in 11 of 30 patients in the control group versus zero of 30 in the vancomycin group (P less than .002). All gram-positive infections occurring in the control group were symptomatic (nine septicemia and two local infections), and one patient with Streptococcus septicemia died with pneumonia. Thus, gram-positive prophylaxis was found to decrease infection morbidity after BMT. Moreover, the number of days with fever (P less than .001), and empiric antibiotic therapy (P less than .01) was reduced without added toxicity or cost. This study confirmed the high prevalence of gram-positive infections after BMT and emphasized the clinical benefits of an adapted prophylaxis. \nAphthoid ulceration of the colon in strongyloidiasis. In humans, infestation with Strongyloides stercoralis most commonly involves the upper small intestine. We describe a 65-yr-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypoalbuminemia, and was found at colonoscopy to have patchy erythema with aphthoid ulcers scattered throughout the large intestine proximal to the splenic flexure. Biopsy of involved areas and examination of the colonic effluent revealed S. stercoralis larvae. Previous reports of colonic involvement with this nematode, and the differential diagnosis of aphthoid ulcers, a newly described lesion associated with S. stercoralis infestation, are discussed. \nMetastatic carcinoma in the neck: a clinical, radiological, scintigraphic and pathological study. This study was undertaken to compare clinical evaluation of the neck with 99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy and computerized tomography (CT) in patients with head and neck carcinoma. Twenty-six patients were studied and in all but one the neck was previously untreated. A total of 31 neck dissections were performed and the specimens examined histopathologically. CT was approximately as accurate (71%) as clinical examination (68%) and more accurate than 99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy (48%) in predicting which necks contained metastatic carcinoma. Overall, 13% of necks had their staging correctly changed by 99mTc(v) DMSA scintigraphy compared with 10% for CT. Although scintigraphy upstaged 13% of clinically N0 necks compared to 6% for CT, it was less sensitive and specific than either clinical examination or CT. 99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy has no role to play in the investigation of patients with metastatic carcinoma to include the clinically N0 neck. \nCoronary-subclavian steal corrected with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. We describe a case of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. A 58-year-old female who had her first coronary bypass operation 6 years previously and a second operation 3 years previously involving the left internal mammary artery and right gastroepiploic artery, developed unusual angina on effort characterized by left precordial pain, pain in the left shoulder and arm, tinnitus and dizziness. Angiography revealed retrograde flow to the left subclavian artery via the left vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery. Severe stenosis of the left subclavian artery was demonstrated at its ostium. Restoration of antegrade flow to the vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery by transluminal angioplasty resulted in complete resolution of these symptoms. \nEffects of lower limb unloading on skeletal muscle mass and function in humans. A model to simulate effects of microgravity on skeletal muscle mass and function in humans has been developed. Unilateral lower limb unloading that allowed ankle, knee, and hip joint mobility was conducted in six healthy men by suspending one lower limb and having the subjects walk on crutches. They performed maximal unilateral concentric or eccentric quadriceps actions at different angular velocities before and after 4 wk of suspension and after 4 days and after 7 wk of uncontrolled recovery. Peak torque (PT) and angle-specific torque (AST) were measured. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and radiological density (RD) of the thigh were assessed by means of computerized tomography. Concentric and eccentric PT and AST across speeds decreased (P less than 0.05) by 22 and 16%, respectively, in response to unloading. At 4 days of recovery PT (-11%) and AST (-7%) were still lower (P less than 0.05) than before. Muscle CSA and RD decreased (P less than 0.05) by 7 and 6%, respectively. After 7 wk of recovery PT, AST, CSA, and RD had returned to normal. The control limb showed no changes over the experimental period except for a 6% decrease (P less than 0.05) in RD. It is suggested that this human model of unloading could serve to simulate effects of microgravity on skeletal muscle mass and function because reductions in muscle mass and strength were of similar magnitude to those produced by bed rest. \nSerum antibodies against respiratory tract viruses in episodes of acute otitis media. Although the findings of epidemiological studies have suggested viral respiratory tract infection (RTI) to be crucially involved in the development of acute otitis media (AOM), the relationship between AOM and viral RTI remains unclear. Serum samples, obtained in the acute and convalescent phases of 57 AOM episodes (in 35 children during the first three years of life) were analysed for IgG antibodies against influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses, parainfluenza virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus and adenoviruses. One third of the AOM episodes (18/57) could be related to viral RTI, as evidenced by significant increases in viral serum antibody activity. Treatment failure occurred in four AOM episodes where increases in serum viral antibody activity were noted. In three of these failures, antibiotic treatment was unsuccessful despite the bacterial strains not being resistant to the drug used. This suggests that concomitant viral infection may be a determinant of treatment outcome in some AOM episodes. \nPelvic abscesses: CT-guided transrectal drainage. Percutaneous drainage of pelvic abscesses has been performed by using a number of approaches, including transabdominal, transgluteal, and transrectal. The authors present a technique for the drainage of pelvic abscesses by a transrectal route with use of computed tomographic (CT) guidance. Equipment for the technique included a plastic introducer tube, standard needle, angiographic guide wire, and pigtail catheters. The pelvic abscesses of 10 patients (six after appendectomy, three after colon resection, one secondary to diverticulitis) were successfully drained by using the new technique. No complications or recurrences were experienced. After initial catheter placement, patients were treated with use of gravity drainage and appropriate antibiotics. Success of drainage was determined with sequential CT scans. Compared with the transgluteal approach, the transrectal approach offered increased patient comfort and minimal risk of potential complications such as injury to the sciatic nerve or tracking of the abscess. Use of the plastic introducer tube promoted operator safety by protecting the guiding finger. On the basis of this initial series, CT-guided transrectal drainage appears to be an effective and well-tolerated method for the drainage of pelvic abscesses. \nFrequent hypoxemia and apnea after sedation with midazolam and fentanyl. More than 80 deaths have occurred after the use of midazolam (Versed), often in combination with opioids, to sedate patients undergoing various medical and surgical procedures. We investigated the respiratory effects of midazolam (0.05 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (2.0 micrograms.kg-1) in volunteers. The incidence of hypoxemia (oxyhemoglobin saturation less than 90%) and apnea (no spontaneous respiratory effort for 15 s) and the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide were evaluated. Midazolam alone produced no significant respiratory effects. Fentanyl alone produced hypoxemia in half of the subjects and significant depression of the ventilatory response to CO2, but did not produce apnea. Midazolam and fentanyl in combination significantly increased the incidence of hypoxemia (11 of 12 subjects) and apnea (6 of 12 subjects), but did not depress the ventilatory response to CO2 more than did fentanyl alone. Adverse reactions linked to midazolam and reported to the Department of Health and Human Services highlight apnea- and hypoxia-related problems as among the most frequent adverse reactions. Seventy-eight per cent of the deaths associated with midazolam were respiratory in nature, and in 57% an opioid had also been administered. All but three of the deaths associated with the use of midazolam occurred in patients unattended by anesthesia personnel. We conclude that combining midazolam with fentanyl or other opioids produces a potent drug interaction that places patients at a high risk for hypoxemia and apnea. Adequate precautions, including monitoring of patient oxygenation with pulse oximetry, the administration of supplemental oxygen, and the availability of persons skilled in airway management are recommended when benzodiazepines are administered in combination with opioids. \nInduction of sustained patency after clot-selective coronary thrombolysis with Hybrid-B, a genetically engineered plasminogen activator with a prolonged biological half-life. BACKGROUND. Despite the utility of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in eliciting coronary thrombolysis clinically, early reocclusion remains a problem, occurring despite anticoagulation in 5-30% of patients with initially successful recanalization. This study evaluated the utility of Hybrid-B, a molecular variant of t-PA with a prolonged half-life in the circulation, in eliciting coronary thrombolysis and maintaining patency in the presence of a continuing thrombogenic stimulus. METHODS AND RESULTS. In intact, anesthetized dogs, either 18 mg Hybrid-B over 30 minutes (n = 15) or 50 mg t-PA (Activase) over 60 minutes (n = 8) was administered starting 60 minutes after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was induced with a thrombogenic copper coil. Time to lysis averaged 54 +/- 26 (means +/- SD) minutes and 64 +/- 34 minutes with Hybrid-B and t-PA, respectively (p = NS). When Hybrid-B was administered as a bolus (20 mg over 1 minute) to induce a high initial concentration in blood, time to lysis was shortened markedly and averaged 15 +/- 5 minutes. Dogs given Hybrid-B by either infusion or bolus exhibited prolonged time to reocclusion (337 +/- 192 minutes compared with 192 +/- 125 minutes in dogs given t-PA, p less than 0.03), reflecting maintenance of a subthrombolytic but persistently active concentration of activator in blood. Despite the persistence of Hybrid-B in blood, concentrations of fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin were not depleted markedly and remained at 77 +/- 25 and 56 +/- 24%, respectively, of control values. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, Hybrid-B, a novel variant of t-PA with unique pharmacokinetic properties, elicits prompt, sustained, and clot-selective coronary thrombolysis. \nRecommendations for collection of laboratory specimens associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Recent discoveries have implicated a number of \"new\" (i.e., previously unrecognized) infectious agents as important causes of outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Unfortunately, the ability to detect these agents in an outbreak can be limited by two factors: 1) the lack of appropriate assays-many of which are still in developmental stages and are not readily available to clinical laboratories, and 2) inadequately or improperly collected specimens. At CDC, many newly developed assays are being used for research and for outbreak investigations. The information in this report is especially intended for public health agencies that collaborate with CDC in investigating outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The report provides an update on guidelines and recommendations for the proper collection of specimens to be sent to CDC, gives general background information concerning some recently discovered pathogens, lists some of the tests available at CDC, and provides a list of CDC contacts. The guidelines and the general information provided on causes of outbreaks of gastroenteritis can be also used by public health workers for investigations when specific testing is available and appropriate. \nRoot of the superior mesenteric artery in pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma: evaluation with CT To determine if changes involving the root of the superior mesenteric artery are specific for neoplasm, the authors retrospectively reviewed 173 computed tomographic (CT) examinations of patients with proved pancreatitis (103 examinations) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (70 examinations). Streaky infiltration of the fat surrounding the root was seen in 27 of 56 examinations of acute pancreatitis, in four of 24 examinations of chronic pancreatitis, in 12 of 23 examinations of pancreatitis complicated by abscess, and in 25 of 70 examinations of pancreatic carcinoma. Periarterial lymph nodes were visible in 14 with acute pancreatitis, in three with chronic pancreatitis, in six with pancreatic abscess, and in 11 with pancreatic carcinoma. A focal mass extended to within 1 cm of the root in 10 with acute pancreatitis, in two with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, and in 24 with pancreatic carcinoma; the mass obliterated the periarterial fat in seven with acute pancreatitis, in one with pancreatic abscess, and in 18 with pancreatic carcinoma. Circumferential encasement occurred in one with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, in 14 with pancreatic carcinoma, and in none with acute pancreatitis; nearly all cases of encasement revealed loss of periarterial fat. Thus, these indicators are not specific for neoplasm. \nThe IgE and IgG subclass antibody response to foods in babies during the first year of life and their relationship to feeding regimen and the development of food allergy. This follow-up study of 191 babies investigated the development of food allergy in an unselected population and its relationship to total and antigen-specific IgE and IgG subclass levels. Sensitization to egg, as indicated by a positive skin test or RAST, was found in 5% of 1-year-old babies, but none of the babies in this series fulfilled the clinical criteria for immediate-type milk allergy. For both bovine casein (CAS) and egg albumin, the IgG response was largely restricted to IgG1 in contrast to the predominant IgG4 response to these antigens that is found in adults. The level of IgG4, but not IgG1, antibody to CAS and ovalbumin (OV) was lower in some of the babies compared with that of their mothers (N = 166; p less than 0.05, Student's paired t test). However, there was no difference in the total serum IgG subclass levels between mothers and babies. These results demonstrate that, in the population of babies studied, (1) type I hypersensitivity to egg occurred in 5% of 1-year-old babies, (2) the predominant IgG subclass of antibodies to CAS and OV in babies is IgG1, and (3) in the 22% of babies, there was substantially (greater than 1000-fold) less IgG4 antibody to CAS and OV than in their mothers, suggesting specific exclusion of some IgG4 antibodies. \nComparison of coronary and myocardial morphologic findings in patients with and without thrombolytic therapy during fatal first acute myocardial infarction. The TIMI Investigators. The hearts of 61 patients (39 men aged 64 +/- 11 years) who died from 5 hours to 42 days (median 3 days) after a fatal first acute myocardial infarction without having undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery were studied to compare clinical and cardiac morphologic features of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy with tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) to those not receiving thrombolytic therapy. Comparison of findings in the 23 patients who received t-PA intravenously 3 +/- 1 hours after onset of symptoms, with the 38 patients who did not, showed similar baseline characteristics with respect to: age, gender, history of hypertension; location of the infarct; heart weight; severity and numbers of coronary arteries narrowed; and frequencies of plaque rupture, plaque hemorrhage and coronary thrombi. Among the patients receiving t-PA, however, there was a greater frequency of platelet-rich (fibrin-poor) thrombi in the infarct-related coronary arteries (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), more nonocclusive than occlusive thrombi (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), and a lower frequency of myocardial rupture (left ventricular free wall or ventricular septum) (5 of 23 [22%] vs 18 of 38 [46%]; p = 0.045). \nSuccessful management of CMV pneumonia in a mechanically ventilated patient. We report a case of severe respiratory failure due to cytomegalovirus pneumonitis in a patient who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, who was successfully treated with the combination of ganciclovir and high-dose intravenous immune globulin. We also reviewed the rationale for the use of combination therapy with an antiviral agent and immunotherapy. Because of the bone marrow toxicity of ganciclovir, an aggressive diagnostic approach, including bronchoalveolar lavage and open lung biopsy, may be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis prior to institution of therapy. \nAre concomitant surgical procedures acceptable in patients undergoing cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism? Cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism is an extremely safe procedure with essentially no operative mortality or morbidity and with success rates approaching 98%. These results have encouraged experienced surgeons to perform other surgical procedures concomitantly with cervical exploration with use of the same general anesthetic agent. This retrospective study was performed to assess the safety and efficacy of this practice. At our institution, 117 patients underwent cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism in combination with an additional surgical procedure, including breast (25), biliary (21), gynecologic (19), intra-abdominal (18), and cardiothoracic (6) operations. The mean operative time was 155 minutes, and the mean duration of hospitalization was 7.6 days. Postoperatively, 115 patients (98%) were normocalcemic. Nine complications (mostly minor), which occurred in eight patients, related primarily to the concomitant surgical procedure. No operative mortality occurred. If performed by experienced surgeons in carefully selected patients, cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism in combination with another elective operation is safe and cost-effective. \nNeedle aspiration of extrathoracic metastases from bronchogenic carcinoma. Five patients with suspected metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma underwent needle aspiration of peripheral metastatic lesions instead of a diagnostic bronchoscopy. Aspirates were from the soft tissue of the proximal arm (three patients), an axillary mass (one patient), and a skin nodule (one patient). Two patients had non-small cell carcinoma, two had small cell carcinoma, and one patient had a nondiagnostic aspirate. The procedure had insignificant morbidity, was easy to perform, quickly established a diagnosis of metastatic disease, and obviated the need for a more invasive diagnostic procedure in four of the five patients. \nReflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome secondary to L5 radiculopathy. A 47-year-old woman developed radiating right lower extremity pain with weakness in the L5 myotomes. A CT scan, subsequent myelogram, and postmyelogram CT scan were reported as negative. Two months of bed rest diminished the radiating symptoms, but the weakness persisted. Three months post onset a severe burning dysesthesia developed in the right foot, and the patient became unable to bear weight on that extremity. Physical examination revealed 4-/5 weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors, foot evertors, toe extensors, and hip abductors. The entire right foot was swollen and had a red, mottled discoloration. An EMG was equivocal, and a three-phase bone scan was positive in the right foot in all three phases, which is characteristic of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. A repeat CT scan and review of the earlier scans revealed a high lateral disc fragment at the exit foramina of the L5 nerve root. Upon laminectomy, a free disc fragment at the exit foramina was removed, and the patient's symptoms resolved completely. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome is very rarely reported in association with lumbar radiculopathy. This case emphasizes the need to carefully evaluate the far lateral exit foramina on CT scan in patients with symptoms of radiculopathy. Myelogram is characteristically normal in these cases. \nSafety and efficacy of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The risks and long-term outcome after 845 elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCA) in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%) were examined. Procedural results were compared with 8,117 consecutive procedures in patients with ejection fractions greater than 40%. The patients with LV dysfunction were older (63 vs 60 years, p less than 0.01), had a greater incidence of prior myocardial infarction (84 vs 45%, p less than 0.001), prior bypass surgery (39 vs 21%, p less than 0.001), 3-vessel disease (62 vs 33%, p less than 0.001), and class IV angina (48 vs 41%, p less than 0.01) than the control group. Angiographic success was lower (93 vs 95%, p less than 0.01), and overall procedural mortality was increased ( 4 vs 1%, p less than 0.001) in the study group. Emergency surgery rates were identical (2%). No significant difference was found in rates of nonfatal Q-wave myocardial infarction (2 vs 1%). At mean follow-up of 33.5 months, 15% of the patients with LV dysfunction required late bypass surgery, 27% underwent repeat PTCA, and 59% were angina free. Actuarial survival at 1 and 4 years was 87 and 69%, respectively. Cox regression analysis identified 3-vessel disease, age greater than or equal to 70 years, class IV angina and incomplete revascularization as correlates of long-term mortality. These data suggest that PTCA may be an effective treatment for coronary artery disease in patients with LV dysfunction. \nImmunocytochemical localization of phospholipase C-gamma in rat embryo fibroblasts. Rat embryo fibroblasts (REF52) exhibit a distinctive, transformation-sensitive distribution of alpha-protein kinase C (alpha-PKC). Receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma generates diacylglycerol, the major cellular activator of PKC. Immunofluorescence techniques were used to investigate the subcellular localization of two PLC isozymes (PLC-gamma and PLC-delta) in normal and simian virus 40-transformed REF52 cells to determine (i) if PLC colocalizes with alpha-PKC and (ii) if PLC isozyme distribution is sensitive to transformation.
