        "text": "ygen saturation from a stable baseline that lasted greater than 30 s) with concurrent increases in Pco2. Two patients had bradycardia during the dips: in one there was non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during the dips and in the other there was ST depression (greater than 0.1 mV at 80 ms after the J point) during a dip. In the controls the fall in mean oxygen saturation from 95.4% when they were awake to 94.4% when they were asleep was less than the fall in patients with heart failure and there were no desaturation dips or arrhythmias. Thus patients with severe heart failure had episodes of oxygen desaturation during sleep, some of which were associated with arrhythmia. Such episodes may be related to the increased risk of sudden death in chronic heart failure. \nPotential use of monoclonal antibodies in the diagnostic distinction of gynecomastia from breast carcinoma in men. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays using the monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) B72.3 and B6.2, recognizing two distinct and independently expressed breast tumor-associated antigens (BTAAs), recently have been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of cytodiagnosis of breast nodules by fine-needle aspiration (FNA). To evaluate whether the same method may be useful diagnostically in distinguishing gynecomastia from breast cancer in men, a retrospective avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase assay study was performed on 50 cases of gynecomastia and 30 cases of breast carcinoma in men, using a panel of five MoAbs known to recognize different BTAAs. The results of this study demonstrated that MoAbs B1.1, HMFG2, and MBr1 displayed a strong reactivity with gynecomastia and carcinoma, but MoAbs B72.3 and B6.2 separated benign and malignant lesions in a high percentage of cases. When used in combination, the latter two reagents reacted with 96% of the carcinomas that were analyzed but labeled only 67% of gynecomastia cases. Thus, the conjoint use of these two reagents may enhance the use of FNA biopsy as a valuable tool in the presurgical diagnosis of breast nodules in men. \nCorynebacterium parvum versus bacille Calmette-Guerin adjuvant immunotherapy of stage II malignant melanoma. Two separate studies have been reported comparing Corynebacterium parvum and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as adjuvant immunotherapy for stage II melanoma patients (The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, 48 patients; Southeastern Cancer Study Group [SECSG], 162 patients). As the criteria for patient selection and drugs used were similar, we have pooled the data to analyze the effects of these two treatments. Both studies used BCG (Tice, Chicago, IL) 3 x 10(8) live organisms per treatment by Tine technique and C parvum (Burroughs-Wellcome, Triangle Park, NC) subcutaneous at a dose of 4 mg/m2 (SECSG) or 5 micrograms/m2 (Hershey) per treatment. The only difference in these studies was the frequency of immunization, with patients in Hershey receiving 22 doses and the SECSG patients receiving 55 doses during the 2-year period of treatment. Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis for the 210 patients shows a prolonged disease-free interval for patients treated with C parvum (P = .02, two-sided Mantel procedure). In similar fashion, patients treated with C parvum had an improved survival rate (from all causes) when compared with BCG-treated patients (P = .012). An analysis of the results for the 170 patients for which the number of positive nodes was available was performed using Cox's model, with nodes as a stratification variable and with covariates of place, treatment, age, and sex. In this analysis, an observed benefit for C parvum on the disease-free interval had a P value of .37 while the benefit of C parvum on the survival times (from all causes) had a P value of .04. When the same analysis was performed using only patients aged younger than 60 years, the observed benefit of C parvum on disease-free interval had a P value of .08 and the benefit of C parvum on survival times (from all causes) had a P value of .008. \nImmunohistochemistry of Terrien's and Mooren's corneal degeneration. Lamellar keratoplasty specimens from a patient with Terrien's marginal degeneration and a patient with Mooren's ulcer were compared using routine histopathologic and immunohistochemical staining with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. Less than 25% of the resident cells in the Terrien's marginal degeneration specimen expressed major histocompatibility class II antigens compared with 75% to 100% of the resident cells in the Mooren's ulcer specimen. The ratio of CD4 cells (T-helper/inducer) to CD8 cells (T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells) in the Terrien's marginal degeneration specimen was almost 1:1 compared with 24:1 in the Mooren's ulcer specimen. In addition, less than 5% of the infiltrating cells from the Terrien's marginal degeneration specimen stained positive for CD22 (B cells), compared with 25% to 50% from the Mooren's ulcer specimen. These data may help explain why Terrien's marginal degeneration runs a more benign course than does Mooren's ulcer and provides a rationale for the use of immunosuppressive drugs to treat Mooren's ulcer. \nDevelopmental disorders of the pediatric spine. Developmental disorders of the pediatric spine are a group of congenital malformations commonly referred to as spinal dysraphism. These malformations are characterized by incomplete or absent fusion of midline mesenchymal, bony, and neural structures. They can be classified according to the presence or absence of an associated back mass. A detailed analysis of the embryology, clinical findings, and radiologic characteristics of the common forms of spinal dysraphism is outlined. \nSubcutaneous lidocaine for treatment of neuropathic cancer pain. Three patients with terminal malignancy reporting ineffective analgesia using systemic and subsequently spinal opiates were treated with subcutaneous infusion of 10% lidocaine hydrochloride. During the infusion, reasonably stable blood concentrations were achieved and maintained using a subcutaneous infusion at varying dose rates over days to months with improvement of the pain complaints which continued to be refractory to conventional analgesics. Blood lidocaine levels obtained at regular intervals revealed effective concentrations between 2 and 5 micrograms/ml for each patient. \nMycosis fungoides in childhood: an unusual presentation. Mycosis fungoides, a cutaneous T cell lymphoma, is rare in childhood and adolescence. We report a case of mycosis fungoides in a 9-year-old boy initially at a site of benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. \nLate results of two hundred seventeen femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments. A 10-year-experience of 217 femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments in 207 patients is reported. Thirty-three femoropopliteal bypasses (15%) were performed with reversed saphenous vein and 184 (85%) with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Operative indications were gangrene in 121 (56%), nonhealing ulceration in 40 (18%), ischemic rest pain in 51 (24%), and claudication in 5 (2%) cases. The 5-year primary graft patency rate of these bypasses was 59% (reversed saphenous vein, 74%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 55%; p less than 0.05), the secondary 5-year graft patency rate was 61% (reversed saphenous vein, 79%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 56%; p less than 0.05), and the 5-year limb salvage rate was 78% (reversed saphenous vein, 78%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 78%). The 30-day operative mortality rate was 10%, and the 5-year patient survival rate was 38%. Eleven patients (5%) required lower extremity amputation because of progressive gangrene or extensive infection despite a patent bypass to an isolated popliteal artery segment. We conclude that femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments (1) have acceptable 5-year graft patency and limb salvage rates; (2) should be performed with reversed saphenous vein grafts when possible; (3) may be performed with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts if necessary, with a resulting limb salvage rate equal to that of reversed saphenous vein grafts; and (4) require sequential extension to an infrapopliteal artery in up to 20% of patients. In addition, the presence of an isolated popliteal artery segment is associated with a high operative mortality rate and limited life expectancy because of coronary artery disease. \nInsights gained from the management of problematical anal fistulae at St. Mark's Hospital, 1984-88. Twenty-four (3.6 percent) patients with problematical anal fistulae out of 671 with anal fistulae were analysed to assess the reasons for their recurrences and ultimate outcome. Thirteen patients (group A) had recurrent fistulae despite two definitive attempts at surgery at this hospital (median number of previous procedures before referral to this hospital was two, range 0-7; median number of definitive procedures at this hospital was three, range 3-4). In five of these patients, the reason for recurrence was missed primary (four cases) or secondary tracks (one case) at earlier operations. Five patients required multiple operations related to the use of setons. Eleven other patients (group B) required colostomy construction, eight because of severe perianal sepsis, two because of complex fistulae, and one for postrectal dermoid. Fistula healing occurred ultimately in all patients in group A after a median of 14 months (range 4-38 months). In group B, fistula healing occurred in eight patients after a median of 7.5 months (range 2-55 months) after colostomy construction. Only one patient has had a proctectomy, and five still have their colostomy. Of the other 18 patients, continence is normal in 14, there is mucus leakage in two, flatus incontinence in one and faecal incontinence in one. In conclusion, persistent attempts to resolve anal fistulae in difficult cases are frequently successful in the long term and result in good continence. \nIn situ DNA hybridization analysis of oral papillomas, leukoplakias, and carcinomas for human papillomavirus. Twenty-one papillomas, 23 ordinary benign keratoses, 13 smokeless tobacco keratoses, 10 verrucous hyperplasias, 10 verrucous carcinomas, 17 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 epithelial dysplasias, and 6 lichen planus lesions were evaluated for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35, with biotinylated double-stranded DNA probes by in situ hybridization. Sixty-two percent (13/21) of oral squamous papillomas were positive for HPV DNA. HPV DNA types 6 and 11 demonstrated the strongest reactivity. Of the 13 cases, 10 also showed some reactivity with HPV-16/18 and -31/33/35. None of the cases of keratoses, epithelial dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous hyperplasia, verrucous carcinoma, or lichen planus were positive for HPV DNA. This study confirms the consistent and frequent finding of HPV DNA in oral squamous cell papillomas and the inconsistency of being able to identify HPV DNA in keratotic, premalignant, or cancerous lesions of the oral mucous membranes. \nAnti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies protect against lethal Escherichia coli infection and lethal tumor necrosis factor-alpha challenge in mice. Potentially fatal physiologic and metabolic derangements can occur in response to bacterial infection in animals and man. Recently it has been shown that alterations in the levels of circulating cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha occur shortly after bacterial challenge. To understand better the role of IL-6 in inflammation, we investigated the effects of in vivo anti-mouse IL-6 antibody treatment in a mouse model of septic shock. Rat anti-mouse IL-6 neutralizing mAb was produced from splenocytes of an animal immunized with mouse rIL-6. This mAb, MP5-20F3, was a very potent and specific antagonist of mouse IL-6 in vitro bioactivity, demonstrated using the NFS60 myelomonocytic and KD83 plasmacytoma target cell lines, and also immunoprecipitated radiolabeled IL-6. Anti-IL-6 mAb pretreatment of mice subsequently challenged with lethal doses of i.p. Escherichia coli or i.v. TNF-alpha protected mice from death caused by these treatments. Pretreatment of E. coli-challenged mice with anti-IL-6 led to an increase in serum TNF bioactivity, in comparison to isotype control antibody, implicating IL-6 as a negative modulator of TNF in vivo. Anti-TNF-alpha treatment of mice challenged i.p. with live E. coli resulted in a 70% decrease in serum IL-6 levels, determined by immunoenzymetric assay, compared to control antibody, thereby supporting a role for TNF-alpha as a positive regulator of IL-6 levels. We conclude that IL-6 is a mediator in lethal E. coli infection, and suggest that antagonists of IL-6 may be beneficial therapeutically in life-threatening bacterial infection. \nImaging of cystic and cavitary lesions of the spinal cord and canal. The value of MR and intraoperative sonography. This article discusses the utility and technique of magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative spinal sonography in the evaluation of cystic and cavitary lesions of the spinal cord and canal. The pathophysiology and fluid dynamics of these lesions are also discussed. \nInspiratory muscle relaxation rate after voluntary maximal isocapnic ventilation in humans. We have investigated whether the capacity of the inspiratory muscles to generate pressure and flow during a ventilatory load is related to changes in inspiratory muscle relaxation rate. Five highly motivated normal subjects performed voluntary maximal isocapnic ventilation (MIV) for 2 min. Minute ventilation and esophageal, gastric, and transdiaphragmatic pressures were measured breath by breath. We observed that ventilation, peak inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and inspiratory flow rate declined from the start of the run to reach a plateau at 60 s that was sustained for the remainder of the exercise. In a subsequent series of studies, MIV was performed for variable durations between 15 and 120 s. The normalized maximum relaxation rate of unoccluded inspiratory sniffs (sniff MRR, %pressure loss/10 ms) was determined immediately on stopping MIV. Sniff MRR slowed as the duration of MIV increased and paralleled the decline in inspiratory pressure and ventilation observed during the 2-min exercise. No further slowing in MRR occurred when ventilation became sustainable. We conclude that, during MIV, the progressive loss of ventilation and capacity to generate pressure is associated with the early onset and progression of a peripheral fatiguing process within the inspiratory muscles. \nClindamycin treatment of chronic pharyngeal carriage of group A streptococci. We previously demonstrated that chronic pharyngeal carriage of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) can be terminated by intramuscular administration of benzathine penicillin plus 4 days of orally administered rifampin. Because an effective oral regimen would be desirable, we compared clindamycin with P + R for treating GABHS carriage. Healthy, symptom-free GABHS carriers were randomly assigned to receive orally administered clindamycin (20 mg/kg per day) three times a day for 10 days or intramuscularly administered benzathine penicillin with oral doses of rifampin (20 mg/kg per day) twice a day for 4 days. Compliance was documented by antibiotic activity in urine. Throat cultures for GABHS were obtained every 3 weeks for up to 9 weeks after treatment. Patients who had positive throat cultures for their original GABHS T type 3 weeks after randomization were crossed over to the other treatment. Treatment success was defined as eradication of the original GABHS T type, with all follow-up cultures negative. Clindamycin eradicated carriage in 24 (92%) of 26 patients; penicillin plus rifampin was effective in 12 (55%) of 22 patients (p less than 0.025). Including patients crossed over 3 weeks after enrollment, clindamycin was effective in 28 (85%) of 33 treatment courses compared with 12 of 22 courses of penicillin plus rifampin (p less than 0.05). We conclude that 10 days of oral clindamycin therapy was significantly more effective than benzathine penicillin plus 4 days of orally administered rifampin for treatment of symptom-free GABHS carriers. \nLinear IgA disease of adults: association with lymphoproliferative malignancy and possible role of other triggering factors. Seventy patients with linear IgA disease of adults were followed up for a mean of 8.5 years and all malignant diseases in this group were ascertained. There were three cases of lymphoproliferative malignancy, which constituted a significant excess over the 0.2 cases that would be expected by comparison with an age- and sex-matched population using National Cancer Registry statistics. In contrast, the non-lymphoid malignancy rate of 13% is almost identical to the expected 14%. A subgroup of 35 of the adult linear IgA disease patients were assessed with respect to the possible precipitating illnesses or drugs, as well as co-existing medical conditions. Almost one-third of patients described an event that was felt could possibly have triggered the linear IgA disease, the most frequent being non-steroidal anti-inflammatory or antibiotic drug therapy, trauma/burns and upper respiratory tract infections. However, it is difficult to determine how often the preceding event is coincidental, and how often, if at all, it is causal. \nUnexplained syncope evaluated by electrophysiologic studies and head-up tilt testing. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical characteristics of subgroups of patients with unexplained syncope having electrophysiologic studies and head-up tilt testing and to assess the efficacy of various therapies. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatient services of a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Eighty-six consecutively referred patients with unexplained syncope. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had electrophysiologic examinations. Patients with negative results subsequently had head-up tilt testing. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine (34%) patients (group 1) had abnormal electrophysiologic results, with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced in 72%. Thirty-four (40%) patients (group 2) had syncope provoked by head-up tilt testing. The cause of syncope remained unexplained in 23 (26%) patients (group 3). Structural heart disease was present in 76%, 6%, and 30% of groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In group 1, pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapy was recommended based on electrophysiologic evaluation. All group 2 patients had negative results on head-up tilt testing while receiving oral beta blockers (27 patients) or disopyramide (7 patients). Group 3 patients did not receive any specific therapy. During a median follow-up period of 18.5 months, syncope recurred in 9 (10%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of electrophysiologic evaluation and head-up tilt testing can identify the underlying cause of syncope in as many as 74% of patients presenting with unexplained syncope. Therapeutic strategies formulated according to the results of these diagnostic tests appear to prevent syncope effectively in most patients. \nHepatitis C virus infection in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers. One hundred eighty-four patients with hepatitis B surface antigen-positive chronic hepatitis were evaluated for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). Only 11 (8%) of 136 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication (HBV-DNA-positive in serum) while 7 (35%) of 20 positive for antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe) but HBV-DNA-negative were positive for anti-HCV. By contrast, anti-HCV was never found in 30 anti-HBe-positive \"healthy\" carriers. Anti-HCV was more frequent in hepatitis D virus (HDV)-positive than in HDV-negative cases (32% vs. 12%). During 1-11 years of follow-up, anti-HCV persisted in 90% of cases, who showed continuing alanine aminotransferase elevation. Liver histology deteriorated in 2 of 4 anti-HCV-positive, anti-HBe-positive, HBV-DNA-negative patients. These results demonstrate the existence of a subgroup of patients with anti-HBe-positive, HBV-DNA-negative, HDV-negative chronic hepatitis B, where HCV may play a leading role in causing liver disease. \nImpact of left ventricular hypertrophy on ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of coronary artery disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy has a grave prognosis. Ventricular arrhythmias may account for a large portion of this poor prognosis, but the contribution of coronary artery disease has not been excluded. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias was investigated by 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 49 hypertensive patients who had normal findings on coronary arteriography. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy was assessed by both ECG and echocardiography. The frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias were significantly related to the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy whether it was defined by wall thickness (interventricular septum or posterior wall greater than or equal to 1.2 cm) or by left ventricular mass indexed to height (left ventricular mass/height greater than or equal to 163 g/m in men and greater than or equal to 121 g/m in women). The relation between left ventricular mass or wall thickness to ventricular arrhythmia was graded and continuous; for every 1 mm increase in the thickness of interventricular septum or posterior wall there was an associated two- to threefold increase, respectively, in the occurrence and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias. In conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of coronary artery disease, and the relation is graded and continuous. \nDuplex Doppler sonography of the carotid artery: false-positive results in an artery contralateral to an artery with marked stenosis. Anecdotal reports have described a false-positive \"jet effect\" or velocity increase in the carotid artery contralateral to an artery with significant stenosis or occlusion when using duplex Doppler sonography. In this study, the frequency, significance, and possible reasons for this finding were evaluated by a retrospective comparison of duplex sonography and angiography. Twenty-three patients with unilateral 81-100% carotid artery stenosis who underwent both duplex sonography (16 Acuson, seven Quantum) and angiography were evaluated. In 14 patients, there was an accurate or slight underestimate (less than 20%) of stenosis present in the internal carotid artery contralateral to an artery with tight stenosis/occlusion. In nine, a velocity increase in the internal carotid artery resulted in overestimation (10-80%) of the actual degree of stenosis. In one of these nine patients, real-time images were sufficient to explain the velocity increase on the basis of vessel tortuosity. In one, falsely elevated velocity resulted from inaccurate assignment of the Doppler angle of incidence in a patient in whom real-time visualization of a distal internal carotid lesion was poor. In four of the nine patients, cross filling via the circle of Willis toward the side of greater stenosis occurred. However, seven of 14 patients in whom there was duplex sonography/angiography agreement or slight duplex sonography underestimation also had cross filling. Vertebral artery patency did not correlate well with the presence of a \"jet effect.\" These findings suggest that an increase in blood flow velocity with duplex Doppler sonography in the internal carotid artery on the side opposite an artery with a tight stenosis is a common source of error and is not readily explained by angiographic evidence of collateral flow. \nExercise echocardiography in the detection of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Twenty long-term survivors of childhood cancer underwent exercise echocardiography to evaluate possible late anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity. Ten patients ages 10 to 20 years had received anthracyclines, and ten patients ages 8 to 27 years had not received anthracyclines as part of their medical regimen. Both groups had normal cardiac function at rest. Patients who had not received anthracyclines had a greater increase in M-mode shortening fraction (P less than 0.005), velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (P = 0.05), and Doppler aortic peak flow velocity (P = 0.01) than patients receiving anthracyclines. There were no significant differences in work performed, or increase in heart rate or blood pressure with exercise between the groups. These results suggest that subtle abnormalities in myocardial function exist which become apparent only after exercise in survivors of childhood cancer who have received anthracyclines and have normal resting cardiac function. \nBlood and liver-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary biliary cirrhosis: increase in activated T and natural killer cells and recruitment of primed memory T cells. We used two-color and three-color flow cytometric analysis to study phenotypical activation and functional subsets of T and natural killer cells in the blood and liver tissue of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, other chronic liver diseases and the blood of healthy subjects. The changes in blood lymphocyte phenotype in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases were similar and comprised elevated relative or absolute numbers of activated human leukocyte antigen-DR + T subset (CD4+ and CD8+) cells and DR+ natural killer-like (CD16+) cells. B cell (CD19+) numbers were normal. In primary biliary cirrhosis a selective reduction in T cells of suppressor-inducer (CD45RA + CD4 + ) type was registered. The human leukocyte antigen-DR expression among CD4+ T cell subsets was investigated further in primary biliary cirrhosis and healthy controls using triple antibody flow cytometric analysis. Phenotypical cell activation was confined to helper T cells of the primed, memory (CD45RO + CD4+) type. The decrease in suppressor-inducer T cells in primary biliary cirrhosis was paralleled by a reciprocal increase in primed memory T cells. Several significant differences were observed when blood and liver-infiltrating cells from primary biliary cirrhosis patients were compared. In the liver tissue, the CD4/CD8 ratio was decreased, the relative activation of T-subset cells and NK cells was further increased, the suppressor-inducer T subset was further depressed and the primed memory T subset was increased. The cytotoxic T-cell subset (CD11b-) dominated within the CD8+ population. In liver tissue from other chronic liver disease subjects, a lower CD4/CD8 ratio was found compared with primary biliary cirrhosis. \nLow nm23 protein expression in infiltrating ductal breast carcinomas correlates with reduced patient survival. Protein levels corresponding to nm23 were determined in normal and neoplastic breast tissues by immunoperoxidase staining. Nm23 protein levels were highest in normal breast epithelium, and lower in intraductal carcinomas. Based on nm23 staining, 39 infiltrating ductal carcinomas were separated into two groups: tumors with homogeneously high nm23 protein content, and tumors with low staining in either a homogeneous or heterogeneous pattern. Patients with low nm23 staining tumors, determined by three pathologists independently, had reduced survival times (alpha = 0.034, alpha = 0.012, alpha = 0.052 by the log rank test). Nm23 expression approached significance as an independent predictor of survival in Cox's proportional hazards model. The data provide the first correlation of low nm23 protein expression and reduced breast carcinoma patient survival. \nEffect of chronic D-Ala,2 D-Leu5-enkephalin or pertussis toxin treatment on the high-affinity state of delta opioid receptor in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells. Chronic treatment of neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells with the opioid agonist D-Ala,2 D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE) induces a homologous desensitization of the delta opioid receptors present in these cells. Since the Kd value of the delta opioid receptor's high-affinity state reflects the potency of the agonist, we examined the effect of receptor desensitization in NG108-15 cells on the percentage of receptor in the high-affinity state. When NG108-15 hybrid cells were treated with 10 or 100 nM DADLE for 4 hr at 24 degrees C, loss of DADLE's ability to inhibit adenylate cyclase was observed. However, when competition binding experiments were carried out with P2P3 membranes isolated from the delta opioid-desensitized hybrid cells, it was determined that 41.7 +/- 3.4% of the total binding sites remained in the high-affinity state, with no apparent alteration in the Kd value of either high- or low-affinity states. Similarly, when NG108-15 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin for 3 hr at 37 degrees C, 39.9 +/- 3.6% of the binding sites remained in the high-affinity state. This reduction in the percentage of receptor in high-affinity state was agonist specific, for chronic treatment of hybrid cells with levorphanol, a partial agonist, or the antagonist naloxone did not alter the percentage of opioid receptors in the high-affinity state. Furthermore, the delta opioid receptors remaining in the high-affinity state after chronic DADLE treatment were still sensitive to both Na+ and guanyldylimidodiphosphate, indicating that opioid ligand binding remained coupled to the G-proteins. \nEffects of prolonged inhalation of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine in rabbits. On the basis of its potent proinflammatory and spasmogenic effects, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), a bacterial oligopeptide, is a putative mediator of bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation during bacterial bronchial infection. However, after an FMLP dose-response curve in rabbits, tachyphylaxis to a second challenge was seen in some rabbits and airway inflammation was absent. This study was designed to reproduce the more prolonged airway exposure to FMLP that may occur during bacterial infection. Two groups of rabbits received FMLP [5 mg/ml in 66% dimethyl sulfoxide- (DMSO) saline] or DMSO diluent alone by nebulization every 15 min for 2 h. Pulmonary resistance (RL) was measured at 1 and 2 h. Recovery from bronchoconstriction was also assessed by measuring RL every 30 min for 2 h after the final FMLP administration. Sections of trachea and large bronchi were prepared and graded by quadrant from 0 to 3 for inflammation, a total score from 0 to 12 being given for each section. There was a progressive increase in RL in FMLP-treated rabbits, reaching 68 +/- 9% above baseline after 120 min, a significantly greater change than after diluent, 8 +/- 12% (P less than 0.01). RL remained elevated above baseline for 90 min after the final FMLP dose. Inflammation scores were greater after FMLP than DMSO: 9.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.7 (P less than 0.01) in trachea and 5.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.01) in lobar bronchi. We conclude that prolonged exposure of airways to FMLP produces a sustained increase in RL and airway inflammation, the cardinal features of infective exacerbations of chronic airflow limitation. \nComparison of transrectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in the staging of prostate cancer. A group of 32 patients with a histological diagnosis of prostate cancer underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to stage the disease. TRUS was more sensitive in the detection of tumour and in the detection of direct extracapsular spread. MRI was more sensitive in the detection of tumour involvement of the seminal vesicles and bladder base. MRI allowed the detection of lymphadenopathy and bone metastases in the lumbosacral spine and pelvis. During MRI the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence was found to be particularly useful for the detection of tumour spread. TRUS and MRI are complementary investigations and for the accurate staging of prostatic malignancy both investigations should be used. \nPreliminary vascular control for renal trauma. Preliminary control of the renal vascular pedicle prior to opening Gerota's fascia is advocated as the standard approach for decreasing the rate of nephrectomy from trauma. This method, however, has not been studied widely. Previous reports failed to grade the severity of the renal injury and involved small patient series and historic control for comparison of nephrectomy rates. We studied 297 patients with renal trauma during a ten year period. Sixty-three of 75 patients with penetrating injuries and 12 of 222 patients with blunt injuries underwent renal exploration. We obtained vascular control prior to opening Gerota's fascia in 32 patients; it was obtained in 43 patients after opening Gerota's fascia. The nephrectomy rate depended on the degree of injury rather than on the type of renal vascular control obtained. Obtaining vascular control after opening Gerota's fascia did not increase the nephrectomy rate and shortened operative time by an average of 58 minutes. We recommend vascular control after opening Gerota's fascia when there is a large hematoma crossing the midline, a rapidly expanding renal hematoma, if the patient is unstable, or if Gerota's fascia has already been opened by the injury. \nMagnesium inhibits the hypertensive but not the cardiotonic actions of low-dose epinephrine. Intravenous magnesium supplementation is often used to control cardiac arrhythmias and coronary artery vasospasm resulting from disturbances of magnesium homeostasis after coronary artery bypass surgery. Many such patients also require inotropic drug support of depressed myocardial function. However, increased serum magnesium concentrations directly depress cardiac contractility in animals and may interfere with catecholamine actions. To determine whether small intravenous doses of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) interfere with the cardiotonic actions of epinephrine, we examined the hemodynamic effects of MgSO4 and epinephrine infusion in 17 cardiac surgical patients on their 1st postoperative day in a prospective, controlled study. In 11 patients, infusion of MgSO4 (7-mg.kg-1 bolus followed by 10 mg.kg-1.h-1 as a continuous infusion) increased serum magnesium concentrations by 44% (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM] of 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 mM; P less than 0.01) but had no significant effect on heart rate; mean arterial, central venous, or pulmonary arterial occlusion pressures; or cardiac output. Epinephrine infusion (30 ng.kg-1.min-1) significantly increased cardiac index (2.7 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.21.min-1.m-2; P less than 0.05); this effect was not altered by MgSO4 administration (n = 11). However, MgSO4 significantly blunted epinephrine's hypertensive action and prevented a significant increase in mean arterial pressure during concurrent MgSO4-epinephrine administration. Six placebo control patients were given two sequential infusions of epinephrine separated by a placebo infusion to rule out an effect of time on the hemodynamic response to epinephrine. Mean arterial pressure and cardiac index responses to epinephrine were identical before and after placebo infusion. \nCombined nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation and rocking bed in chronic respiratory insufficiency. Nocturnal ventilatory support of a disabled person at home. The use of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation via nasal mask with a rocking bed provided the necessary ventilatory support for a person with quadriplegia living at home. This option was required to maintain an independent life-style of choice. The combination of techniques and the linkage of devices demonstrated an effective use of simple available technology for respiratory care at home and the adaptation of the respiratory prescription to the total needs of each person: medical, social, and financial. The further use of nasal mask ventilation in selected cases is encouraged by clinical research protocol. \nEvidence for a specific role of vasopressin in sustaining pituitary-adrenocortical stress response in the rat. In the adult male Wistar rat a 2-fold 2-min restraint stress exposure, repeated 15 min apart, activated the adrenocortical secretion more than a single one would have. However, in rats with a pharmacological block of the endogenous CRF release, exogenous CRH (0.3 micrograms/kg iv), administered 15 min after a first similar dose, was unable to stimulate pituitary-adrenocortical activity above the level attained with the first peptide injection. On the contrary, in the same conditions exogenous arginine vasopressin (AVP) (0.3 micrograms/kg iv) administered 15 min after CRH, was able to further stimulate pituitary-adrenocortical activity. Using the same experimental procedure, oxytocin (0.3 micrograms/kg iv) was found to be totally inactive. The physiological import of these findings was investigated in the Brattleboro rat, genetically lacking in endogenous AVP, in which, unlike the control Long-Evans strain, the 2-fold stress exposure did not cause an increase in plasma corticosterone concentration greater than that of a single exposure. These results suggest that endogenous AVP is essential in sustaining adrenocortical activation in circumstances in which pituitary refractoriness towards CRH stimulation intervenes. \nUse of folic acid for prevention of spina bifida and other neural tube defects--1983-1991. Neural tube defects--including spina bifida, anencephaly, and encephalocele--are common, serious birth defects that are important causes of infant mortality and disability. Women in the United States who have had a pregnancy resulting in an infant or fetus with a neural tube defect have a 2%-3% risk for having another pregnancy resulting in an infant or fetus with a neural tube defect (i.e., a recurrence) The British Medical Research Council (MRC) Vitamin Study Group recently reported the results of a randomized prevention trial that indicated that daily oral supplementation with folic acid before conception and during early pregnancy substantially reduces the recurrence of neural tube defects. This report summarizes the findings of that study and provides recommendations for supplementation with folic acid to prevent the recurrence of neural tube defects. \nLow-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) vs dextran 70. The prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. The Danish Enoxaparin Study Group. A prospective randomized study compared the thromboprophylactic efficacy and safety of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), enoxaparin (40.6 mg subcutaneously once daily), with a standard regimen of dextran 70 in patients undergoing elective total hip replacement. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by bilateral ascending phlebography 7 to 11 days after operation. Two hundred forty-six patients were included and 219 were eligible for analysis. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in seven of 108 patients in the LMWH group and in 24 of 111 patients in the dextran group. Clinical symptoms of pulmonary embolism did not develop in any patients during the study. In the postoperative period, patients receiving LMWH had a lower blood loss in drains and required fewer blood transfusions than patients receiving dextran, although no significant differences were noted between the groups with respect to the total number of blood transfusions required. Bleeding events and adverse events did not differ between the groups. None of the patients died in hospital during the study. One patient in the LMWH group died at home 15 days after the operation. Three patients receiving dextran had development of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis after hospital discharge. In conclusion, enoxaparin was a more effective thromboprophylactic than a standard regimen of dextran in patients undergoing total hip replacement. The two regimens were equally safe under the clinical conditions. \nRecurrent kidney stones: causes and diagnostic criteria in patients from Campania (southern Italy). A study was carried out on 180 recurrent kidney stone formers from the Campania region of southern Italy. The data showed that this hypercalciuric population was similar to that in previous studies; however, there was no difference in terms of parathyroid activity when compared with normal controls. The slightly depressed serum levels of vitamin D in hypercalciurics indicate that gut calcium absorption is not directly related to vitamin D levels. We found no difference in the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities associated with stone formation between the patients in this series and those in previous studies. \nIncreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor number in chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Production of the antiviral cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha is increased in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and clinical studies of tumor necrosis factor-alpha have indicated a proviral effect at higher doses. To determine whether this might be related to abnormal cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor expression, binding characteristics of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers were studied using radioiodinated recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The specific binding curves generated were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard to determine cell surface receptor numbers and dissociation constants. A single class of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor was demonstrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mononuclear subsets. The median number (range) of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from controls (n = 11), chronic hepatitis B virus patients seropositive for hepatitis B virus DNA (n = 8) and seronegative for hepatitis B virus DNA (n = 8) were 2,329 (range = 1,538 to 3,133), 3,375 (range = 2,300 to 6,718) (p less than 0.01) and 3,113 (range = 2,229 to 5,246) (p less than 0.05) sites/cell, respectively. They all had similar dissociation constants of 8.4 x 10(-10) mol/L (range = 4.1 to 16.9), respectively. Further dissection of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that this increase in cell surface receptor number was confined to the monocyte fraction (p less than 0.01). Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in five patients with increased monocyte cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor numbers were also elevated. \nIntratemporal facial nerve hemangiomas. Facial nerve hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that arise within the temporal bone and have a histologic appearance similar to both cavernous hemangiomas and vascular malformations. In contrast to facial nerve schwannomas, these are extraneural tumors that cause symptoms by compression and tend to produce deficits when very small in size. We report our experience at the House Ear Clinic with 34 patients having these nonglomus intratemporal vascular tumors. Hemangiomas arising in the internal auditory canal tend to produce a progressive sensorineural hearing loss and are demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas those at the geniculate ganglion are usually first seen with facial nerve symptoms and may require high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) for detection. Facial electromyography is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Because of their extraneural nature, early diagnosis can permit removal of the tumor with preservation of facial nerves in some patients. \nCellular ions in hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. A nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic study. To investigate the cellular basis linking hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and obesity, we used 31P and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure intracellular pH (pHi), free magnesium (Mgi), and cytosolic free calcium (Cai) in erythrocytes of obese and NIDDM subjects with and without hypertension. Compared with normotensive, nondiabetic controls (Cai, 25.2 +/- 1.4 nM; Mgi, 232 +/- 8 microM), Cai was elevated in both normotensive (36.8 +/- 2.7 nM, sig = 0.005) and hypertensive (43.4 +/- 2.9 nM, sig = 0.001) NIDDM subjects, and Mgi was concomitantly suppressed (normotensive: 206 +/- 11 microM, sig = 0.05; hypertensive: 196 +/- 8 microM, sig = 0.001). Similar but less striking changes were noted in obese subjects. Values of pHi were significantly lower (sig = 0.05) in all hypertensive groups compared with their normotensive controls. Continuous relations were observed for all subjects between Cai and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.649, p less than 0.001) and body mass index (r = 0.565, p less than 0.001), between Mgi and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.563, p less than 0.001) and fasting blood glucose (r = -0.580, p less than 0.001), and in diabetics, between pHi and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.680, p less than 0.001). Thus, the constellation of elevated Cai and suppressed Mgi and pHi levels is characteristic of the hypertensive state. These abnormalities of cellular ion handling in whole or in part common to hypertension, diabetes, and obesity may contribute to the pathophysiology of these syndromes and may help to explain their frequent clinical coexistence. \nOxygen radicals generated at reflow induce peroxidation of membrane lipids in reperfused hearts. To test whether generation of oxygen radicals during postischemic reperfusion might promote peroxidation of cardiac membrane lipids, four groups of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were processed at the end of (a) control perfusion, (b) 30 min of total global ischemia at 37 degrees C without reperfusion, (c) 30 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion with standard perfusate, (d) 30 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion with the oxygen radical scavenger human recombinant superoxide dismutase (h-SOD). The left ventricle was homogenized and tissue content of malonyldialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation, was measured on the whole homogenate as well as on various subcellular fractions. Reperfusion was accompanied by a significant increase in MDA content of the whole homogenate and of the fraction enriched in mitochondria and lysosomes. This phenomenon was not observed in hearts subjected to ischemia but not reperfused, and was similarly absent in those hearts which received h-SOD at reflow. Reperfused hearts also had significantly greater levels of conjugated dienes (another marker of lipid peroxidation) in the mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction. Again, this phenomenon did not occur in ischemic hearts or in reperfused hearts treated with h-SOD. Unlike the effect on tissue MDA and conjugated dienes, reperfusion did not significantly stimulate release of MDA in the cardiac effluent. Treatment with h-SOD was also associated with significant improvement in the recovery of cardiac function. In conclusion, these data directly demonstrate that postischemic reperfusion results in enhanced lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes, which can be blocked by h-SOD, and therefore is most likely secondary to oxygen radical generation at reflow. \nPhysician practices in the prevention of venous thromboembolism. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of use of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in high-risk hospital patients. DESIGN: A retrospective medical record review. SETTING: A community-wide study in 16 short-stay hospitals in central Massachusetts. PATIENTS: A total of 2017 patients with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: On the basis of age, length of hospitalization, and the presence of at least one additional major risk factor, 17% of 151,349 discharges (25,410 patients) were identified as being at high risk for venous thromboembolism. Eight percent of these discharges were randomly selected for medical record review. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism was received by 32% of these high-risk patients. Prophylaxis use among the 16 study hospitals varied widely, ranging from 9% to 56%, and was higher in teaching hospitals than in nonteaching hospitals (44% compared with 19%; P less than 0.001). One or more of the following methods of prophylaxis was used: low-dose heparin (78%), intermittent calf compression (13%), warfarin (12%), and inferior vena caval filter (3%). Use of prophylaxis increased with the number of risk factors identified (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis for venous thromboemobolism is underused, particularly in nonteaching hospitals. \nIntra-aortic balloon counterpulsation support in the high-risk cardiac patient undergoing urgent noncardiac surgery. Patients with a recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, sever angina, or uncorrected multivessel coronary artery disease are at increased risk of cardiac complications after major noncardiac surgery. Although invasive hemodynamic monitoring and preoperative optimization of cardiac status may lead to some reduction in the rate of perioperative cardiac events, the mortality from such events remains high. We report our experience with the use of perioperative intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in eight patients with unstable coronary syndromes or severe coronary artery disease who underwent urgent noncardiac surgery. There were no perioperative cardiac events while the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was in place. There were two postoperative cardiac events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure) in the first postoperative week after the IABP was removed. One patient required emergent femoral thrombectomy as a result of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and subsequently died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be considered as an adjunct to maintain hemodynamic stability for the high-risk cardiac patient about to undergo urgent or emergent noncardiac surgery. \nThe short test of mental status. Correlations with standardized psychometric testing. The Short Test of Mental Status can be administered to patients in inpatient and outpatient settings in approximately 5 minutes, and it contains items that test orientation, attention, immediate recall, arithmetic, abstraction, construction, information, and delayed (approximately 3 minutes) recall. The test was administered to a group of demented community patients and their age- and sex-matched control subjects. Using an age-adjusted approach, sensitivity of the test to identifying dementia is 86.4, with a specificity of 93.5. The test was compared with standardized tests of cognitive function such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Mattis Dementia Scale, and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and showed a high degree of correlation. Group means and standard deviations for subtest items and total score are presented for control subjects (n = 138), demented patients (n = 130), and patients with memory impairment only (n = 20). Percentile scores for subtest items in control subjects are also provided. \nDiagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of thermography for lumbar radiculopathy. A meta-analysis. The role of thermography for diagnosing lumbar radiculopathy was evaluated by literature review and meta-analysis. From 81 relevant citations, 28 studies could be analyzed for diagnostic-accuracy data (sensitivity and specificity) and method. Diagnostic-accuracy data varied significantly between studies; therefore meaningful pooled summary statistics could not be reported. Twenty-seven studies had major methodologic flaws including biased test interpretations, faulty cohort assembly, poor clinical descriptions, and small sample size. The only study of reasonably high quality found no discriminant value for liquid-crystal thermography. The role of thermography remains unclear. Rigorous clinical research is required to establish its diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility. Thermography cannot be recommended currently for routine clinical use in evaluating low-back pain. \nEosinophilic cystitis in children. Eosinophilic cystitis is an uncommon inflammatory disorder of the urinary bladder which causes irritative voiding symptoms and may mimic rhabdomyosarcoma radiographically. In children, eosinophilic cystitis has been previously reported to be self-limiting and requires no specific therapy. Reported herein is a case of a nine-year-old girl in whom eosinophilic cystitis recurred following antireflux surgery, raising the question of an association of eosinophilic cystitis with local trauma such as bladder surgery. Consideration should be given to pretreatment with steroids and antihistamines prior to surgery in these patients. \nDysrhythmias and blood pressure changes associated with thrombolysis. Recent technologic advances facilitate salvage of viable myocardium before the process of myocardial infarction is complete. The aim of thrombolytic agents is to restore antegrade flow of blood in occluded coronary arteries. The process of reperfusion may be dysrhythmogenic because of the heterogeneous return of electrical activity in myocardial cells. This study examined the incidence and type of dysrhythmia occurrence and the associated changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA). A retrospective chart review of 41 subjects showed that 80% of subjects experienced dysrhythmias during TPA therapy. The most common dysrhythmia was sinus bradycardia, followed by idioventricular/accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular premature beats, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. There was a significant difference between MAP changes when there were no dysrhythmias and MAP changes when dysrhythmias occurred (p less than 0.05). The largest change in MAP (-22.71 mm Hg) was observed when dysrhythmias occurred in those subjects with blockage of the left anterior descending artery, although there was no statistically significant difference in changes in MAP among the groups of different sites of blockage (p greater than 0.05). \nCytogenetic abnormalities associated with renal cell carcinoma. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on 23 renal cell carcinomas (21 sporadic and 2 associated with von Hippel-Lindau's disease). Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in 19 of 21 of the sporadic tumors. The most frequent abnormalities were a loss or rearrangement of material in 3p (11 of 21 cases) or an extra chromosome 7 (7 of 21 cases). Correlation between specific chromosomal abnormalities and clinical presentation was absent with the exception of trisomy 7 and -Y, which occurred only in patients more than 60 years old. An increasing number of cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with a greater likelihood of renal vein and/or capsule involvement. Both patients with von Hippel-Lindau's disease had tumors with a normal karyotype. \nCommon bile duct distensibility after cholecystectomy. To assess the possibility of common bile duct distensibility after cholecystectomy, we made a retrospective study of patients who had ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The study comprised 52 patients without extrahepatic biliary obstruction; 19 had had cholecystectomy, 18 of whom complained of biliary colic similar to that they had had originally. The other 33 patients had intact, well visualized gallbladders; 15 of these patients had pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, but none had chronic pancreatitis. The average diameter of the common bile duct at its widest point by ultrasonography was 4.8 mm (range, 4.0 to 9.0 mm) in the 33 patients with intact gallbladders, and 5.7 mm (range, 4.0 to 8.0 mm) in the 19 patients who had had cholecystectomy. The diameter by ERCP was 4.4 mm (range, 2.9 to 6.3 mm) in the patients with intact gallbladders, and 11.17 mm (range, 6.9 to 14.7 mm) in the patients who had had cholecystectomy. In each patient who had had cholecystectomy the diameter as measured by ERCP was larger than it appeared by ultrasonography. The results suggest that the common bile duct is distensible, and that this distensibility may be related to the postcholecystectomy syndrome. \nLong-term efficacy of oral cisapride in symptomatic upper gut dysmotility. We conducted a 12-month trial of cisapride (10 mg three times a day) in 21 patients with gastric stasis due to clinically and manometrically diagnosed gastroparesis (N = 9; seven due to diabetes) or chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (N = 12). Radionuclide solid-liquid gastric emptying tests were performed at baseline and at the end of the 12-month period. Symptoms were assessed monthly by diary and every three months by the investigators; frequency and severity of symptoms were scored in a standardized manner. For the whole group of 21 patients, gastric emptying of both solids and liquids improved significantly after one year of cisapride (P less than 0.05). Among chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction patients, there was predominantly an improvement in gastric emptying of solids; in contrast, patients with gastroparesis had a greater improvement in liquid emptying. Total symptom score improved significantly in the gastroparesis group (median score: 8 at baseline vs 6 at one year, P less than 0.05) but not in the chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction patients (median score at baseline 10 vs 9 at one year). Similarly, body weight showed a trend towards improvement in the gastroparesis group. No significant side effects were noted. We conclude that during a 12-month open trial, cisapride was effective in improving gastric emptying in patients with gastric stasis and consistently improved symptoms in those with gastroparesis. \nHELLP syndrome: a case report with guidelines for diagnosis and management. A 25-yr-old patient with a twin pregnancy of 34 weeks gestation developed HELLP syndrome and required urgent delivery by Caesarean section. Before operation, a central venous catheter and urinary catheter were inserted, and fresh frozen plasma and platelets were administered to correct hypovolaemia and severe thrombocytopenia. This case demonstrates the critical condition of these patients before operation and that extensive preoperative preparation and invasive monitoring are necessary for successful management. The choice of anaesthetic is governed by the presence of liver and renal dysfunction and severe thrombocytopenia. \nExpression of natriuretic peptide in ventricular myocardium of failing human hearts and its correlation with the severity of clinical and hemodynamic impairment. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was immunohistochemically investigated in (1) right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens from 87 apparently healthy donor hearts taken from victims of cerebral accidents; (2) 1 normal heart not suitable for transplantation (HBsAg carrier); (3) right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens from 151 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DC); and (4) 57 explanted hearts, 26 with DC and 31 with ischemic heart disease. No ANP immunoreactivity was found in normal ventricles. Failing hearts showed ventricular positivity in 31% of the DC biopsy series, in 61% of the left ventricles, and in 30% of the right ventricles of the explanted heart series. An endoepicardial gradient was observed, because ANP positivity was greater and more extensive in the subendocardial layers. Ultrastructural studies were performed on biopsy specimens from 10 normal hearts and 132 DC biopsy samples. No ANP-storing granules were found in biopsy samples of normal ventricles, whereas ANP granules were seen in 15 of 132 (11.4%) DC cases. In parallel immunoblotting, investigation showed the same 13 kDa band protein in 1 normal atrium as well as in 8 failing atria and ventricles. ANP immunoreactivity was positively correlated with higher New York Heart Association functional classes as well as with higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.005), end-diastolic volume (p less than 0.005) and end-diastolic volume index (p less than 0.005). In conclusion, apparently healthy ventricles do not show ANP immunoreactivity, whereas failing ventricles do. ANP expression seems to be independent of the underlying disease, but positively related to the clinical status and the degree of left ventricular impairment and dilatation. \nHigh-energy proton beam radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies. Potential of proton beam as an alternative to brachytherapy. Fifteen patients with advanced gynecologic malignancies were treated with high-energy proton beam radiation therapy (RT) at the Particle Radiation Medical Science Center (PARMS), Tsukuba University, Japan, from 1983 to 1987. The potential of proton beam RT as an alternative to conventional brachytherapy was evaluated. Except for one local recurrence, 14 of 15 patients were locoregionally controlled for 15 to 57 months. Two-year local control rate and 2-year survival rate were 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively. Two cases of transient, radiation-induced proctitis (neither of which required surgical treatment) were the only complications despite a target dose that exceeded 8000 cGy in most cases. The results suggest that sharply localized, high-dose proton beam RT can produce an antitumor effect equivalent to that of conventional brachytherapy. \nPropafenone disposition and pharmacodynamics in normal and norepinephrine-induced cardiomyopathic rabbit hearts. The myocardial disposition and pharmacodynamics of propafenone were studied in 10 normal and 10 norepinephrine-induced cardiomyopathic rabbit hearts. The left ventricular propafenone concentrations measured after perfusion of propafenone (0.3 microM) for 150 min were similar in the normal group (18 +/- 8 micrograms/g) compared to the cardiomyopathy group (20 +/- 5 micrograms/g, P = NS). However, the concentration of propafenone in cardiomyopathic left ventricular papillary muscle, which was always extensively involved in the inflammatory process, was significantly lower (11 +/- 2 micrograms/g) compared to normal papillary muscle (19 +/- 4 micrograms/g, P less than .05). During propafenone perfusion a significantly greater increment in ventricular conduction time was observed in the cardiomyopathy group (17 +/- 6 msec) compared to the normal group (12 +/- 3 msec, P less than .05). The propafenone myocardial concentration-effect relationships describing changes in QRS duration were shifted to the left in the cardiomyopathy group. Furthermore, the slopes of these linear concentration-effect relationships were greater in the cardiomyopathy group (1.80 +/- 0.60 msec/micrograms/g) compared to the normal group (1.07 +/- 0.25 msec/micrograms/g, P less than .01). The ventricular effective refractory period was shorter at base line in the cardiomyopathy hearts (156 +/- 21 msec) compared to the normal group (176 +/- 23 msec, P less than .08). However, propafenone effects on changes in the ventricular effective refractory period were similar in the two groups. Thus, the myocardial accumulation of propafenone is reduced in areas of extensive necrosis observed in norepinephrine-induced cardiomyopathy. As well, cardiomyopathic tissue is more responsive to propafenone effects on ventricular conduction time. \nRoles of adenosine and theophylline on the recovery of adenine nucleotides in postischemic cultured renal tubular cells. The effect of adenosine (ADO) on the recovery of cellular adenine nucleotides (AN) was evaluated in the cultured cells deprived of oxygen and substrates (ischemia) and in nonischemic cells (control). The primary cultured cells were obtained from microdissected rabbit proximal straight tubules. Ten-day-old cultured cells were made ischemic for 6 hr, and allowed to recover for 24 hr. At the end of ischemia, cells were incubated with ADO, theophylline (T), dipyridamole (D), coformycin (C) or combined agents for 3 hr. Total AN (TAN) were determined after 3 and 24 hr of recovery. The results, after 3 hr of incubation, suggest that in both control and ischemic cells, ADO is taken up by cultured cells and is preferentially converted to nucleotides. This effect is blocked by D, which inhibits ADO uptake, uninfluenced by C, which inhibits ADO deaminase and potentiated by T, which inhibits 5'-nucleotidase. After 24 hr of recovery, the beneficial effects of ADO alone or combined D, C, or T, on TAN were not seen in control cells. In contrast, in the ischemic cells, after 24 hr of recovery, ADO + T normalized ATP, ADP and TAN to the preischemic levels. T alone significantly increased ATP after 24 hr of recovery. To demonstrate further that the beneficial effect of T is due to inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase, cells were treated with adenosine alpha, beta-methylene diphosphate in the same manner as T. Combined ADO + adenosine alpha, beta-methylene diphosphate normalized ATP, ADP and TAN after 24 hr of recovery. This finding suggests that inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase improves postischemic AN. \nInteractive effects of ST-T wave abnormalities on survival of patients with coronary artery disease. Previous studies have documented a reduced survival time in patients with an electrocardiographic (ECG) ST-T wave abnormality. This study was designed to determine the clinical, hemodynamic and angiographic correlates of this observation. Data from 9,731 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization from 1976 through 1986 were analyzed; 5,531 had severe (greater than 70%) obstruction of at least one major coronary artery, 1,706 had mild (10 to 69%) obstruction and 2,494 had no obstruction. Of the patients with severe obstruction, 2,536 were treated medically and 2,995 were treated by surgical revascularization. Patients with an ST-T abnormality had more clinical risk factors (including older age and greater prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and prior myocardial infarction) and greater left ventricular dysfunction (including higher end-diastolic pressure and ventricular volume, reduced ejection fraction and greater prevalence of contraction abnormality) than did those without this ECG pattern. Survival time was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced in subsets of patients with an ST-T abnormality and with severe or mild coronary artery disease; in those without coronary disease, ST-T changes did not correlate with reduced survival. Stepwise regression analysis was applied to each group to determine the independent predictors of 5-year survival. In patients with severe disease or no disease, an ST-T abnormality was not chosen as an independent predictor of 5-year survival; in the group with mild disease, ST-T changes were an independent predictor of reduced survival. Thus, the independent impact of an ST-T abnormality on survival is dependent on the severity of underlying coronary artery disease. \nThe effect of preoperative flurbiprofen on miosis produced by acetylcholine during cataract surgery. Sustained pupillary dilation during cataract surgery may be achieved with preoperative noncorticosteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as flurbiprofen. However, these agents may interfere with miosis after injection of acetylcholine. Thirty patients for extracapsular cataract extraction were randomly assigned in a double-masked fashion to receive either a placebo or preoperative 0.03% flurbiprofen every 30 minutes for four doses. All patients also received three doses of 2.5% phenylephrine and 2% cyclopentolate. Pupillary diameter was measured the day before surgery, immediately before the surgical incision, immediately before and five minutes after acetylcholine injection, and the morning after surgery. The flurbiprofen group had a larger mean pupillary diameter before injection of acetylcholine (P less than .001), five minutes after acetylcholine (P less than .001), and on the first postoperative day (P less than .005). \nPrevalence of asthma in Melbourne schoolchildren: changes over 26 years. OBJECTIVES--To determine the prevalence of asthma in the past 12 months in Melbourne schoolchildren aged 7, 12, and 15 years and to compare the prevalence of a history of asthma with that of 26 years ago. DESIGN--A questionnaire on respiratory symptoms was distributed to children for completion by parents and return to the school. Subjects were selected by a stratified cluster design. SETTING--Government and non-government schools in the greater Melbourne area, Australia. SUBJECTS--10,981 children. Parents completed questionnaires for 3324 children aged 7, 2899 aged 12, and 2968 aged 15. The overall response rate was 90%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--History of wheeze or asthma in the past 12 months and in lifetime. RESULTS--The prevalences of wheeze in the past 12 months were 23.1%, 21.7%, and 18.6% for 7, 12, and 15 year olds respectively. A history of wheeze was more common in boys than in girls at age 7 (443/1711 v 324/1614) and 12 (418/1767 v 322/1718) but not at age 15. Overall, 78% (1548) of those reporting wheeze also reported a history of asthma and 83% (1611) had used a bronchodilator. The prevalence of a history of asthma among 7 year olds was 46% compared with 19.1% in the 1964 survey, an increase of 141%. CONCLUSIONS--The current prevalence of asthma in Melbourne schoolchildren is high and has risen substantially over the past 26 years. \n'Role of bone marrow stromal cells in the growth of human multiple myeloma. We have verified the hypothesis that multiple myeloma (MM) may be disseminated by circulating clonogenic cells that selectively home to the bone marrow (BM) to receive the signal(s) leading to proliferation, terminal differentiation, and production of the osteoclast activating factors. Long-term cultures of stromal cells have been developed from the BM of nine patients with MM. These cells were mostly fibroblast-like elements, interspersed with a proportion of scattered macrophages and rare osteoclasts. BM stromal cells were CD54+, produced high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and measurable amounts of IL-1 beta, and were used as feeder layers for autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). After 3 weeks of cocultures, monoclonal B lymphocytes and plasma cells, derived from PBMC, developed and the number of osteoclasts significantly increased. Both populations grew tightly adherent to the stromal cell layer and their expansion was matched by a sharp increase of IL-6 and by the appearance of IL-3 in the culture supernatant. These data attribute to BM stromal cells a critical role in supporting the growth of B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and osteoclasts and the in vivo dissemination of MM. \nIrreducible inguinal hernia in children below two years of age Eighty-five cases of irreducible inguinal hernia in children below 2 years of age were reviewed. Non-operative treatment was successful in 71 (84 per cent); 14 children required emergency surgery. The younger the child and the longer the duration of symptoms at presentation, the worse was the outcome of non-operative treatment. In 35 (41 per cent) children the diagnosis of inguinal hernia had been made before irreducibility. There is an increased incidence of postoperative complication associated with irreducibility, especially in preterm infants. Early diagnosis of inguinal hernia in young children and prompt referral for surgery is recommended. \nRickettsial meningitis and encephalitis. Nine of 72 patients with scrub typhus and three of 137 with murine typhus presented with meningitis and/or encephalitis syndromes. Focal neurologic signs were rare, and cerebrospinal fluid profiles were similar to those of leptospirosis and viral and tuberculous meningitis. One patient had papilledema, and another had cerebellitis. Other major organ involvement (renal, liver, or lungs) occurred in five patients. One patient died and four spontaneously recovered, while the conditions of the rest responded well to either chloramphenicol or doxycycline. Scrub and murine typhus should be included in the differential diagnoses of aseptic meningitis and encephalitis in patients exposed to endemic areas, especially when accompanied by renal insufficiency and/or jaundice. They are treatable forms of virallike meningoencephalitis. \nBeneficial effect of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with high-grade carotid stenosis. North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial Collaborators BACKGROUND. Without strong evidence of benefit, the use of carotid endarterectomy for prophylaxis against stroke rose dramatically until the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30 to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the 331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than 0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and ipsilateral high-grade stenosis (70 to 99 percent) of the internal carotid artery. \nIsolated atrial infarction in a patients with single vessel disease of the sinus node artery. Atrial infarction is found in approximately 17 percent of autopsy-proven cases of myocardial infarction, but is a frequently missed clinical diagnosis. The antemortem diagnosis of atrial infarction occurring in the absence of ventricular infarction has not been previously reported. We present a patient with ischemic chest discomfort associated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Electrocardiographic and enzymatic changes were consistent with atrial infarction. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated single vessel critical stenosis at the origin of the sinus node artery. Combined atrial and ventricular infarction occurs frequently and should be considered in the setting of paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias occurring early in the course of ventricular myocardial infarction. Lone atrial infarction is a rare but distinct clinical entity. The tetrad of typical ischemic chest discomfort, paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia, P-Ta segment shifts, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels without evidence for ventricular infarction strongly suggests isolated atrial infarction. \nAlcohol consumption and risk of coronary heart disease. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the hypothesis that the apparent protective effect of habitual alcohol consumption on coronary heart disease is due to drinkers at high risk of coronary heart disease becoming non-drinkers. DESIGN--Case-control population based study. Data were obtained from interviews with patients with non-fatal myocardial infarction and their controls and with the next of kin of those who had died of coronary heart disease and their controls. SETTING--Auckland, New Zealand. SUBJECTS--Two groups of cases were studied. The first comprised 227 men and 72 women with non-fatal myocardial infarction identified from a population based surveillance programme for coronary heart disease; controls were 525 men and 341 women randomly selected from the same population group and matched for age and sex. The second group comprised 128 men and 30 women who had died of coronary heart disease and had been identified from the surveillance programme; controls were a sample of the previous control group and comprised 330 men and 214 women matched for age and sex. All participants were aged 25-64 years and without diagnosed coronary heart disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Regular alcohol consumption; high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low density lipoprotein concentrations. RESULTS--Men with myocardial infarction and men who had died of coronary heart disease were more likely to have been never drinkers (had never drunk more than once a month) than controls (18% v 12% and 23% v 13% respectively). After possible confounding factors had been controlled for, people in all categories of drinking (up to more than 56 drinks per week) had at least a 40% reduction in risk of fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease compared with never drinkers. Former drinkers also had a lower risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction than never drinkers (relative risks 0.41 and 0.10 in men and women respectively) but a similar risk of death from coronary heart disease. The reduction in risk was consistently greater in women than in men in all drinking categories but there was no clear dose-response effect in either sex. CONCLUSIONS--The results support the hypothesis that light and moderate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. This protective effect in this population was not due to the misclassification of former drinkers with a high risk of coronary heart disease as non-drinkers. \nCorticobasal degeneration. A unique pattern of regional cortical oxygen hypometabolism and striatal fluorodopa uptake demonstrated by positron emission tomography. Corticobasal degeneration presents with an asymmetric akinetic-rigid syndrome, apraxia and combinations of supranuclear gaze palsy, myoclonus, and an alien limb. Six patients aged 59-77 yrs, diagnosed on clinical criteria as having corticobasal degeneration, have been studied with positron emission tomography using tracers of dopamine storage capacity and oxygen metabolism. Striatal 18F-6-fluorodopa uptake was reduced in an asymmetric pattern, caudate and putamen being involved in all cases. Uptake into medial frontal cortex was also impaired. Regional cortical oxygen metabolism was most significantly depressed in the superior and posterior temporal, inferior parietal, and occipital associated cortices. Within the frontal lobe, the hypometabolism was chiefly posterior. This unique combination of regional hypometabolism and disruption of the nigrostriatal system is discussed in relation to the clinical features of the disease and is compared with reported findings in other disorders of cognition and movement. \nTrends in use of coronary angiography in subacute phase of myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. Most patients do not undergo acute reperfusion after myocardial infarction, and which of these patients should undergo coronary angiography is still debated. METHODS AND RESULTS. We analyzed the 1-year clinical outcomes and rates of coronary angiography performed as late as 60 days after myocardial infarction in 3,804 patients admitted between 1979 and 1988 and followed in six different centers. Patients less than 75 years old were classified into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups using a multivariate analysis of historical and clinical variables gathered during the first 8 hospital days. Patients who underwent early reperfusion (17%, all after 1984) were analyzed separately. To analyze time trends, patients were compared before and after mid-1984. Mortalities from day 9 through 1 year were similar for the two time periods in the low- (3.3% versus 2.5%) and medium-risk (7.4% versus 5.6%) groups, but mortality was lower for the high-risk group after 1984 (31.6% versus 20.0%). The proportion of patients undergoing coronary angiography increased dramatically in each group after 1984 (low risk, 18% versus 48%; medium risk, 23% versus 49%; high risk, 10% versus 32%, before and after 1984, respectively). Furthermore, a large percentage of patients (more than 40%) in the low-risk group did not have at least one of the indications for coronary angiography recently recommended by a joint task force. Among patients undergoing coronary angiography, the proportion of patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease decreased after 1984, whereas the proportion undergoing mechanical revascularization in the year after infarction increased in all risk groups. CONCLUSIONS. Despite the recent development of noninvasive techniques with high sensitivity for detecting high-risk patients after myocardial infarction, coronary angiography is being performed increasingly in all patients, including those determined to be at low risk for complications based on clinical data. The economic consequences of such a trend could be considerable, and its impact requires careful analysis. \nGastric carcinoma in patients with Crohn disease: report of four cases. An association between Crohn disease and gastric carcinoma has not been described before. However, we report four patients with documented Crohn disease in whom gastric carcinoma developed later. In three of the four patients, onset of Crohn disease occurred after the age of 40. All of the patients had nonspecific constitutional symptoms and/or complaints referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract. No clinical evidence of active Crohn disease was present. In each patient, barium examination and CT showed either a mass (two cases) or other radiologic features of malignancy (two cases). Endoscopy with biopsy was performed in three patients and findings were misleading in two patients. The possibility of an increased risk of malignancy in sites remote from inflamed bowel segments has been reported. The findings in this study suggest that patients with Crohn disease, particularly disease of late onset, may be predisposed to the development of gastric carcinoma. \nUse of recombinant human interleukin-2 in conjunction with syngeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice as a model for control of minimal residual disease in malignant hematologic disorders. Unlike allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), autologous BMT is not accompanied by immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects; hence, the relapse rate observed after autologous BMT in malignant hematologic disorders is higher than that observed after allogeneic BMT. Autologous BMT represents a much safer medical procedure available for many patients in need in situations where allogeneic BMT is not feasible or risky. The present experiments were designed to investigate whether it might be possible to combine the therapeutic benefits of autologous BMT with additional immunotherapy after BMT. The tumor model used for investigating GVL effects was the murine B-cell leukemia (BCL1), a spontaneous, nonimmunogenic, highly lethal leukemia of BALB/c origin. BALB/c mice inoculated with 10(3) BCL1 leukemia cells were treated on day-1 with cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg and transplanted with normal syngeneic BM cells on day 0. High-dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) (100,000 Cetus units x 3/day intraperitoneally x 5 consecutive days) was initiated on day +1, +7, or +21 after BMT. Kinetics of lymphocyte reconstitution after syngeneic BMT indicated a steep increase in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes on days 17 through 24. All experimental groups were observed for relapse. Mice receiving no rIL-2 therapy relapsed and died within 50 days after BMT, whereas mice receiving rIL-2 showed long-term disease-free survival. Optimal time for administration of rIL-2 was noted at 3 weeks post-BMT, with 90% of the mice surviving with no evidence of disease for more than 1 year. Similarly, when 10(4) BCL1 cells were given 1 day after syngeneic BMT to simulate minimal residual disease after syngeneic BMT, rIL-2 therapy administered at 14 days post-BMT seemed effective in prolonging disease-free survival in contrast to the same regimen given at 1 day after BMT. Our data suggest that immunotherapy with rIL-2 should be further investigated as a new immunotherapeutic tool for decreasing the relapse rate after BMT for hematologic malignancies. \nA rare cause of nasal obstruction: a solitary neurofibroma. This case represents a peripheral nerve sheath tumor as a cause of nasal obstruction. Nerve sheath tumors are relatively uncommon; however, most otolaryngologists will encounter them. These tumors develop from cranial and spinal nerve roots and from peripheral nerves. In total, approximately 25% to 44% of nerve sheath tumors occur in the head and neck region. Although the most important are cranial nerve tumors--the majority being acoustic neuromas arising from the vestibular nerve--they may also develop in the nasal cavity. \nCocaine-induced myocardial infarction. A growing threat to men in their 30s. A clear association has been established between cocaine use and acute myocardial infarction. Because of the continuing rise in cocaine use in the United States, many more young patients have or will have this disorder. Such patients are usually managed conservatively with calcium channel blockade and have an excellent in-hospital prognosis. If chest pain recurs or stress testing reveals evidence of ischemia, cardiac catheterization should be done. If cocaine use is discontinued, the long-term prognosis of a typical patient with cocaine-induced acute myocardial infarction is excellent in the absence of other chronic illnesses. \nAmbulatory stab evulsion phlebectomy for truncal varicose veins. The management of primary varicose veins is evolving. Recovery time, cost, recurrence rate, and cosmesis are critical determinants. Classic \"high ligation\" and ankle-to-groin stripping is expensive, results in a long convalescence, and may produce unacceptable scarring and possible permanent nerve injury. This report describes the technique of stab evulsion phlebectomy performed in an outpatient setting. Under loco-regional anesthesia, and after high ligation, existing tributary and trunk varicosities are evulsed with specially designed hooks. The multiple stab incisions, 1.5- to 3-mm long, are closed with adhesive strips. Fifty-six patients, with 69 involved limbs, have been operated on during the past 9 months. Postoperative pain and complications were minimal. Convalescence was eliminated and all patients immediately resumed normal daily activities. Cosmesis was excellent. This technique is based on hemodynamically accurate principles. It effectively removes all varicosities, eliminates the proximal source of reflux, and disconnects potentially outflowing perforators, yet leaves in situ undamaged trunk veins, which may be used as potential vein grafts. \nTranscriptional regulation of c-jun gene expression by arabinofuranosylcytosine in human myeloid leukemia cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) induces terminal differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells. Other studies have shown that the c-jun protooncogene is expressed during phorbol ester-induced myeloid differentiation. This work examines the effects of ara-C on c-jun gene expression in human KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells. The results demonstrate that c-jun transcripts are undetectable in uninduced KG-1 cells and that ara-C induces expression of this gene in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Ara-C treatment was also associated with increases in c-jun transcripts in U-937, THP-1, and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, transcriptional run-on analysis has demonstrated that exposure to ara-C increases the rate of c-jun gene transcription. The results also demonstrate that while inhibition of protein synthesis superinduces c-jun mRNA levels in phorbol ester-treated KG-1 cells, cycloheximide had no effect on the induction of c-jun transcripts during ara-C treatment. Moreover, the half-life of c-jun transcripts in ara-C-treated KG-1 cells was 42 min. These findings suggest that the increase in c-jun mRNA observed during ara-C treatment is regulated by a transcriptional mechanism, and that c-jun may be involved in the induction of differentiation and regulation of gene expression by ara-C. \nProenkephalin A in bone-derived cells. Enkephalins, a group of small peptides with opiate-like activity, have been defined originally as neuropeptides. Recent reports showed, using in situ hybridization, that the enkephalin-encoding gene, proenkephalin A (pEnkA), is expressed in nondifferentiated cells of diverse mesodermal lineages. The transient expression of pEnkA in these tissues during organogenesis suggests that this gene is involved in processes such as differentiation and/or cell proliferation. In situ hybridization revealed that bone and cartilage are among the tissues that express pEnkA most actively during organogenesis. Here we show that pEnkA mRNA is abundant in normal calvaria-derived cells and in osteosarcoma-derived cell lines ROS 17/2.8 and ROS 25/1. In addition, pEnkA-derived peptides are synthesized and secreted by these cells, as revealed by specific RIA. pEnkA expression in ROS cells is decreased by osteogenin, an osteoinductive factor, and by the calcium-regulating hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, whereas the osteoblastic phenotype marker, alkaline phosphatase, is increased by these factors. These results together with the inhibitory effects of pEnkA-derived peptides on alkaline phosphatase activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells suggest that pEnkA is involved in bone development and provide a model system for further analysis of pEnkA expression during this process. \nRocker-soled shoes and walking distance in patients with calf claudication. Calf claudication is the major clinical manifestation of peripheral vascular occlusive disease in a significant number of patients. Although claudication causes substantial patient disability, most patients are treated conservatively because of the risks of surgical therapy and the uncertain efficacy of drug therapy. It was hypothesized that rocker-soled shoes would decrease the work of the plantar flexors and therefore increase walking distance in patients with calf claudication. To test this hypothesis, walking distances in patients with calf claudication using rocker-soled shoes and a placebo shoe insert were compared. Rocker-soled shoes significantly increased both the total distance walked and the distance at which patients were initially bothered by symptoms by 77m (37%, p less than .0005) and 89m (91%, p = .003), respectively. It was concluded that rocker-soled shoes may reduce disability in patients with calf claudication by increasing walking distance. \nSympathetic neural control of vascular muscle in reduced renal mass hypertension. Vascular smooth muscle (VSM) transmembrane potentials (Em) were measured in situ in small branch arteries (150-300-microns o.d.), small branch veins (300-400-microns o.d.), arterioles (90-150-microns o.d.), and venules (80-250-microns o.d.) in the mesenteric and gracilis muscle and the arterioles and venules of cremaster muscle vascular beds in anesthetized rats with reduced renal mass hypertension (HT-RRM) and normotensive sham-operated RRM control rats. All rats were given a 4% NaCl diet for 2 weeks with water ad libitum. Relative to sham, HT-RRM mesenteric and gracilis arterial and venous vessels, but not the microvessels of the cremaster muscle bed, were less polarized during superfusion with normal physiological salt solution. Also relative to sham, hyperpolarization responses to local sympathetic neural (SNS) denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine were greater in mesenteric and gracilis small arteries, arterioles, veins, and venules but not in cremaster microvessels. The immediate (less than 5-minute) electrogenic depolarization response to local blockade of VSM Na(+)-K+ pump activity with 10(-3) M ouabain was similar between each respective HT-RRM and sham vessel pair in each vascular bed. \nEffects of hypothermia and hyperthermia on the reactivity of rat intracerebral arterioles in vitro. The effects of hypothermia and hyperthermia on the cerebral microcirculation were studied using isolated perfused intracerebral (parenchymal) arterioles obtained from rats. In a temperature-dependent manner, hypothermia (20.0 degrees to 35.0 degrees C) dilated the spontaneous tone developed by the arterioles and also diminished their contractile response to potassium and prostaglandin F2 alpha. In contrast, hyperthermia (40.0 degrees to 45.0 degrees C) induced a biphasic response consisting of initial vasoconstriction and secondary vasodilation. Exposure of the vessels to 45.0 degrees C for 30 minutes irreversibly abolished the spontaneous tone and responsiveness of the arterioles when the temperature of the preparation was returned to 37.5 degrees C. In calcium-free solutions, however, the arteriolar diameter was not affected within a temperature range of 20.0 degrees to 45 degrees C. Furthermore, arterioles that had been in a calcium-free solution during exposure to 45 degrees C temperature recovered their viability at 37.5 degrees C. These results suggest that changes in ambient temperature alter calcium-induced contraction in arteriolar smooth muscle, and that the irreversible effects of hyperthermia on the arterioles are dependent upon extracellular calcium. These studies indicate that alterations in brain temperature may affect the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia by mechanisms that are in part independent of parenchymal metabolism. \nDynamic tracking of cardiac vulnerability by complex demodulation of the T wave. A link is found between T wave alternans and vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation, and a new approach is provided for quantification of susceptibility to malignant arrhythmias. Complex demodulation reveals that alternation of the electrocardiogram is concentrated during the first half of the T wave, coinciding with the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. During myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, there are marked increases in the degree of T wave alternans that parallel the established time course of changes in vulnerability. The influence of the sympathetic nervous system in arrhythmogenesis is also accurately detected. Ultimately, complex demodulation of the electrocardiogram could provide a technique for identification and management of individuals at risk for sudden cardiac death. \nBalloon dilation of postsurgical subaortic obstruction. Two children aged 10 and 5.5 years underwent balloon dilation for postsurgical subaortic obstruction. The outcome and the role of this procedure are discussed. \nPost stenotic aneurysm in popliteal artery entrapment syndrome. In a retrospective review of 74 cases of Popliteal Entrapment Syndrome collected over a 16 year period, 10 cases of aneurysm were found (13.5%). This represents an incidence of 26% of the 38 cases of popliteal aneurysm of any etiology seen during the same period of time. In contrast to atherosclerotic aneurysms, these aneurysms were seen in a young age group (21-30 years of age) and all were associated with popliteal entrapment. Evidence is presented to support our opinion that these aneurysms are post-stenotic in origin. We feel that young adults with symptoms of leg ischaemia and evidence of an aneurysm of the popliteal artery should be investigated for popliteal entrapment and treated before complications occur. We have found a posterior approach to be the most satisfactory method of exploring the popliteal fossa. \nA prospective study of liver function in infants and children exposed to daily isoflurane for several weeks. Eleven infants and children presenting for daily radiotherapy for a period of at least 2 weeks were anaesthetised with isoflurane in 33% oxygen and nitrous oxide. They were unpremedicated and given no other agents to supplement anaesthesia. The average number of exposures was 24 (SD 11; range 10-39) and the total anaesthetic time per exposure varied between 15 and 30 minutes. Liver function was assessed by determining serum total bilirubin, aspartate amino transferase, gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase before the start of treatment and at 5-daily intervals thereafter. There was no measurable change in any of these determinants of liver function. All children accepted daily induction of anaesthesia with isoflurane. Induction, maintenance and recovery from anaesthesia were uncomplicated. \nFK 506 ameliorates the hepatic injury associated with ischemia and reperfusion in rats. The effect of FK 506 on regeneration of the liver was studied in rats after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy after 60 min of ischemia of the unresected liver. The animals were divided into three distinct groups of 10 rats each. Group 1 (controls) received 0.5 ml saline solution intravenously 30 min after the induction of ischemia. Groups 2 and 3 were injected with FK 506 (0.3 mg/kg) intravenously 30 min after and 24 min before the induction of hepatic ischemia, respectively. The hepatic content of ATP and serum levels of ALT and lactate dehydrogenase were determined on each animal. In addition, the histological appearance and mitotic activity of the remnant liver was determined at regular 24-hr intervals after hepatic ischemia. All 10 control animals died within 72 hr. Treatment with FK 506 resulted in improved survival in groups 2 and 3 (30% and 80%, respectively). The improved survival seen in the FK 506-treated animals was reflected by a restoration of hepatic ATP content, a reduction in the serum levels of ALT and lactate dehydrogenase, an amelioration of hepatic necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration and an increase in the mitotic activity of the liver. These results suggest that FK 506 ameliorates the hepatic injury associated with ischemia/reperfusion and has a potent stimulatory effect on liver cell regeneration that may make it valuable as a hepatoprotective agent when administered to organ donors before graft harvesting. \nSynthesis of C1 inhibitor in fibroblasts from patients with type I and type II hereditary angioneurotic edema. Patients with hereditary angioneurotic edema (HANE) have serum levels of functionally active inhibitor of the first component of complement (C1 INH) between 5 and 30% of normal, instead of the 50% expected from the single normal allele. Increases in rates of catabolism have been documented in patients with HANE and certainly account for some of decrease in C1 INH level. A possible role for a decrease in synthesis of C1 INH in producing serum levels of C1 INH below the expected 50% of normal has not been well studied. We studied the synthesis of C1 INH in skin fibroblast lines, which produce easily detectable amounts of C1 INH. In type I HANE cells, C1 INH synthesis was 19.6 +/- 4.0% (mean +/- SD) of normal, much less than the 50% predicted. In type II HANE cells, the total amount of C1 INH synthesis (functional and dysfunctional) was 98.9 +/- 17% of normal; the functional protein comprised 43% of the total. Thus, type II HANE cells synthesized functional C1 INH at a much greater rate than for the type I cells. In both type I and II HANE cells, amounts of steady-state C1 INH mRNA levels paralleled rates of C1 INH synthesis, indicating that control of C1 INH synthesis occurred at pretrans",
