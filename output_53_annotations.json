        "text": "trahepatic hematoma: a rare complication of exchange transfusion. A four-day-old male neonate who underwent three exchange transfusions for jaundice owing to ABO incompatibility on three consecutive days is presented. A large intrahepatic hematoma developed as a complication of the third exchange transfusion. The baby fully recovered. \nPartial motor epilepsy with \"negative myoclonus\". Three children had both nocturnal unilateral motor seizures and daytime ipsilateral \"negative myoclonus\" which occurred so frequently that it resembled asterixis. Neurophysiologic studies demonstrated lateralized spike discharges that were time-locked to postural lapse in the contralateral outstretched arm. The clinical course was characterized by good seizure control with benzodiazepines. \nTreatment of acute migraine with subcutaneous sumatriptan. Sumatriptan succinate, a 5-HT1D receptor agonist, constricts human cranial arteries. Two parallel-group trials for treatment of acute migraines were conducted in the United States. Adult patients were randomized and given either 6 mg of sumatriptan succinate subcutaneously (n = 734) or placebo (n = 370). At 1 hour, sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing moderate or severe headache pain to mild or no pain (70% vs 22%), in completely relieving headaches (49% vs 9%), and in improving clinical disability (76% vs 34%). Sumatriptan also reduced nausea and photophobia significantly better than placebo. Patients with residual migraines received another injection; those who had originally received sumatriptan received either a second active injection (n = 187) or placebo (n = 178), while those who had received placebo received a second placebo injection (n = 335). Statistical evidence for benefit of second sumatriptan injection is absent. Adverse events associated with sumatriptan were tingling, dizziness, warm-hot sensations, and injection-site reactions. Sumatriptan is effective and well tolerated in patients with acute migraine. \nDeletion of sequences upstream of the proteinase improves the proteolytic processing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expresses structural proteins and replicative enzymes within gag and gag-pol precursor polyproteins. Specific proteolytic processing of the precursors by the viral proteinase is essential for maturation of infectious viral particles. We have studied the activity of proteinase in its immature form, as part of a gag-pol fusion protein, in an in vitro expression system. We found that deletion of p6*, the region in pol upstream of proteinase, resulted in improved processing of the precursor. A modified proteinase is released, but it functions less efficiently than wild type. Improved autoprocessing correlates with increased accessibility of the active site region in the polyprotein carrying the p6* deletion. Our results suggest that p6* is involved in the regulation of proteinase activation, perhaps as a region limiting the interaction of the active site and substrate binding domain with the remainder of the polyprotein. Release of p6* inhibition may be an activation step necessary for infectious particle maturation. \nDipyridamole echocardiography stress testing in hypertensive patients. Targets and tools. Arterial hypertension can provoke a reduction in coronary flow reserve through several mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive, namely, coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and microvascular disease. These different targets of arterial hypertension should be explored with different diagnostic markers. The transient dyssynergy detected by two-dimensional echocardiography and evoked during dipyridamole infusion is a marker of coronary disease that is equally reliable in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. On the contrary, dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression is frequently elicited in hypertensive patients when angiographically assessed coronary disease is absent. This ischemiclike electrocardiographic response can be found in echocardiographically assessed left ventricular hypertrophy. However, even when left ventricular mass is normal, dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression is associated with an impaired coronary flow response to pacing, which is consistent with microvascular disease. Whether echocardiographically silent electrocardiographic changes are simply diagnostic noises transmitting a misleading false positive response or a potentially important clinical marker of early myocardial damage remains a pivotal though still unanswered question. \nResponse characteristics of a dual transcutaneous oxygen/carbon dioxide monitoring system. We tested the response characteristics of a dual transcutaneous (tc) PO2/PCO2 monitoring system in healthy subjects who breathed various gas mixtures, and we compared steady-state tc readings to simultaneous arterial blood gas analysis in 20 stable respiratory outpatients. The electrodes were simple to apply, required very little skin preparation, and had trivial signal drift. In healthy subjects, tcPCO2 lag time during CO2 rebreathing was 16.8 seconds, with a 90 percent response time of 77.9 seconds after CO2 breathing was discontinued. The 90 percent response times of the O2 electrode when subjects breathed a hypoxic mixture was 257 seconds after a lag of 31 seconds. When inhaled gas mixtures were changed from hypoxia to room air, the lag time was shorter (12.5 seconds), but 90 percent response time exceeded 5 minutes. In stable patients with respiratory disease, tcPCO2 and tcPO2 were linearly related to PaCO2 (range, 19 to 53 mm Hg) and PaO2 (range, 45 to 99 mm Hg), respectively (tcPCO2 = 1.4 PaCO2-9.44, with r = 0.90 and SEE = 5.35 mm Hg; tcPO2 = 0.56 PaO2 + 20.4, with r = 0.53 and SEE = 11.7 mm Hg). We conclude that the response of the dual transcutaneous monitoring system is more rapid for the CO2 than the O2 electrode and may be rapid enough to be useful in some clinical settings; however, the O2 system fails to offer the response characteristics and accuracy that would allow it to be substituted for arterial gas tensions in unstable clinical situations. \nRisk factors for stroke as predictors of platelet membrane fluidity in Alzheimer's disease. We have previously reported that increased platelet membrane fluidity identifies a subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who have distinct clinical features including an earlier age of symptomatic onset, a more rapidly progressive cognitive decline, and a decreased prevalence of focal electroencephalographic findings. In the current study, these patients also exhibited a decreased prevalence of risk factors for stroke compared with patients who had normal platelet membrane fluidity. Our findings suggest that the platelet membrane abnormality describes a clinical subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who are less likely to have coexisting cerebrovascular disease than the remaining patients who meet clinical consensus criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease. \nEnhancement of mammary carcinogenesis by high levels of dietary fat: a phenomenon dependent on ad libitum feeding Female 55-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a single intravenous dose of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), 2 mg/100 g of body weight each. At 60 days of age, the rats were divided into four dietary groups (41-42 rats/group):I, 5% corn oil diet fed ad libitum; II, 20% corn oil diet fed ad libitum; III, 5% corn oil diet fed 12% less than group I; and IV, 20% corn oil diet fed 12% less than group II. The 5% and 20% corn oil diets were purified semisynthetic diets that were isonutrient on a caloric basis. All animals were housed individually in single cages; food consumption of each animal was computed daily throughout the study. Sixteen weeks after carcinogen treatment, mean numbers of mammary carcinomas per rat (+/- SE) in groups I, II, III, and IV were 4.1 +/- 0.6, 6.8 +/- 0.7, 3.0 +/- 0.3, and 4.1 +/- 0.5, respectively. Mean weight of mammary carcinomas per rat (g +/- SE) in groups I, II, III, and IV were 3.5 +/- 0.7, 8.0 +/- 1.3, 3.0 +/- 1.1, and 4.6 +/- 1.3, respectively. Mammary carcinoma number and weight were significantly (P less than .01) increased in the animals fed the 20% corn oil diet ad libitum when compared with those fed the 5% corn oil diet ad libitum; however, no significant differences in mammary tumor number or weight were observed between the animals fed a restricted, 20% corn oil diet and those fed a restricted, 5% corn oil diet. The study involving the animals fed the 12%-restricted diets was repeated (38-42 rats/group), with virtually identical results, i.e., the mean number of mammary carcinomas per rat in the groups fed the restricted 5% fat and 20% fat diets at termination of the study was 3.1 +/- 0.4 and 3.7 +/- 0.3, respectively, and the mean weight (g) of mammary carcinomas per rat was 4.3 +/- 1.2 and 4.0 +/- 1.1, respectively (no significant differences). Thus, high levels of dietary fat can significantly enhance mammary carcinogenesis in female rats, but only in animals on an ad libitum feeding protocol. A slight restriction in amount consumed (12% less than ad libitum) abolished the mammary carcinogenic differential between a high-fat and a low-fat diet. \nRecombinant interferon alfa given before and in combination with standard chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first marrow relapse: a Pediatric Oncology Group pilot study. Recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN-alpha) was given to 31 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first on-therapy marrow relapse as the sole treatment (30 megaunits/m2/d intravenously x 10 days) before standard four-drug reinduction and during multiagent continuation therapy (30 megaunits/m2 subcutaneously x 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks). After 10 days of rIFN-alpha, there were two partial remissions (PRs); seven additional patients had either greater than or equal to 25% reduction in the percentage of marrow blast cells or hypoplastic marrow. Two patients had progressive disease with an increase in leukocyte counts. All patients experienced influenza-like symptoms, and there were isolated instances of severe abdominal pain and personality change. Dose-limiting toxicity comprised grade III/IV transaminase elevation (two patients) and syncope with personality change (one patient). Twenty-three of 31 children (74%) subsequently achieved marrow remission using standard agents. One patient was taken off study during teniposide (VM-26) and cytarabine (ara-C) consolidation due to toxicity. Continuation therapy including rIFN-alpha pulse was well tolerated in the remaining children; only one patient required rIFN-alpha dosage reduction (for CNS toxicity). rIFN-alpha toxicity did not necessitate reductions in doses of standard chemotherapy agents or significant delays in therapy. Five patients remain in remission at 26+ to 36+ months; 13 patients relapsed in marrow, one in the meninges (7 months), and one in meninges, mediastinum, and lymph nodes (2 months). Two children were removed from study for marrow transplant. In summary, high-dose rIFN-alpha alone had a modest antileukemic effect. In contrast to the clinical experience with combined rIFN-alpha and chemotherapy in adults, rIFN-alpha given in a pulse-like manner throughout continuation therapy did not compromise the intensity of the standard chemotherapy regimen. \nEnhanced gastric mucosal haemostasis after upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. An endoscopic technique for the measurement of gastric mucosal bleeding time has been developed to study gastric haemostasis in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The relation of gastric mucosal bleeding time to skin bleeding time and nonsterodial anti-inflammatory drug usage was examined in 61 control patients and in 47 patients presenting with bleeding peptic ulcers or erosions. Gastric mucosal bleeding time was shorter in patients with haemorrhage (median 2 minutes, range 0-5 minutes) than in the control group (median 4 minutes, range 2-8 minutes) (p less than 0.001). Skin bleeding times were similar in the two groups (medians 4 minutes in patients with haemorrhage and 4.5 minutes in controls). In 21 patients with haemorrhage who were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the median gastric mucosal bleeding time (2.5 minutes, range 1.0-5.0 minutes) was similar to that in 26 patients with haemorrhage not associated with these drugs (2.0 minutes, range 0.0-5.0 minutes). These results show that gastric mucosal haemostasis is accelerated in response to haemorrhage in the upper gastrointestinal tract, even in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This enhanced gastric haemostasis probably reflects a local protective response to minimise blood loss from the bleeding lesion. \nPrognostic value of serum proteins synthesized by breast carcinoma cells. Several breast carcinoma cell lines or explants of such tumors, as well as examples of lactating or dysplastic breast tissue, synthesized three serum proteins (alpha 2-Zn-glycoprotein, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and alpha-lipoprotein) in vitro. These proteins were detected by immunoperoxidase techniques in 126 breast carcinomas that had been evaluated clinically for more than six years. Alpha-2-Zn-glycoprotein was present in 58% of the carcinomas, whereas alpha 1-antichymotrypsin was seen in 55% and alpha-lipoprotein in 52%. These markers showed a relationship with clinical outcome. Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-lipoprotein were unfavorable determinants, whereas alpha 2-Zn-glycoprotein was detected in lesions with a favorable evolution. Taken individually, these markers have similar but rather weak associations with five-year survival rates; roughly 20% of patients in the \"favorable\" group died, compared with 33% in the \"unfavorable\" group. Alpha-2-Zn-glycoprotein in grade 1 tumors was a marker with marginally favorable significance, but alpha 1-antichymotrypsin significantly worsened the prognosis of grade 2 and 3 tumors. Furthermore, stratification of patients according to the number of positive unfavorable markers yielded striking results. Eight percent of patients with none of the unfavorable markers were dead at five years, compared with 55% of those whose lesions expressed three unfavorable markers. \nTotal replacement for post-traumatic arthritis of the elbow. Fifty-three of 55 consecutive elbow replacements for post-traumatic arthritis were followed for a minimum of two years (mean 6.3, range 2 to 14.4). The patients presented difficult management problems, having undergone an average of two previous operations per joint; 22 joints had suffered prior complications; 18 had less than 50 degrees of flexion and six were flail. One of three versions of the Coonrad prosthesis was employed in all. During the follow-up period, 10 patients underwent 14 revision procedures for aseptic loosening; 38 elbows are currently without progressive radiolucent lines. In two patients an elbow had to be resected, one for deep infection and the other for bone resorption following a foreign-body reaction to titanium. The current design of the Coonrad prosthesis offers a reliable option for the treatment of post-traumatic arthritis but should be used only in carefully selected patients over the age of 60 years. \nCardiac rehabilitation services: what are they and are they worth it? The objectives of cardiac rehabilitation include lowering mortality but, more importantly, increasing functional capacity so reducing disability and potentially improving quality of life. The data suggest that cardiac rehabilitation services are worth the patient's costs and efforts and as such, they should be considered an integral component of comprehensive cardiovascular care by cardiologists and primary care physicians. While there is considerable agreement on the roles of exercise testing and training in the three position stands, there are also substantiated, and important, differences in their recommendations on other cardiac rehabilitation services, such as counseling and risk factor management. The challenge for the 1990's is not only to continue to better define the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation services, but more urgently, how to deliver effective services most efficiently. This will help physicians provide optimum care for their patients, will improve the patient's likelihood of regaining for themselves an active and productive life, and should generate a more equitable and accountable reimbursement system for quality health care. \nRisk stratification for arrhythmic events in postinfarction patients based on heart rate variability, ambulatory electrocardiographic variables and the signal-averaged electrocardiogram. The value of heart rate variability, ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) variables and the signal-averaged ECG in the prediction of arrhythmic events (sudden death or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias) was assessed before hospital discharge in 416 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the follow-up period (range 1 to 1,112 days), there were 24 arrhythmic events and 47 deaths. The initial relation between several prognostic factors and arrhythmic events was explored with use of the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates of survival function. Impaired heart rate variability less than 20 ms (p less than 0.0000), late potentials (p less than 0.0000), ventricular ectopic beat frequency (p less than 0.0000), repetitive ventricular forms (p less than 0.0000), left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% (p less than 0.02) and Killip class (p less than 0.02) were identified as significant univariate predictors of arrhythmic events. When these variables were analyzed by using a stepwise Cox regression model, only impaired heart rate variability, followed by late potentials and repetitive ventricular forms remained independent predictors of arrhythmic events. The combination of impaired heart rate variability and late potentials had a sensitivity of 58%, a positive predictive accuracy of 33% and a relative risk of 18.5 for arrhythmic events and was superior to other combinations including those incorporating left ventricular function, exercise ECG, ventricular ectopic beat frequency and repetitive ventricular forms. These results suggest that a simple method of assessment based on heart rate variability and the signal-averaged ECG can select a small subgroup of survivors of myocardial infarction at high risk of future life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death. \nHemianesthesia, sensory neglect, and defective access to conscious experience. We report a patient with an ischemic stroke in the vascular territory of the right middle cerebral artery who had left spatial neglect and left hemianesthesia. The patient showed a dissociation between defective verbal reporting of somatosensory stimuli delivered to the left hand and physiologic evidence from an autonomic index. This indicates that there was processing of undetected stimuli without the patient's awareness, and suggests that the hemianesthesia was due, at least in part, to somesthetic hemi-inattention. \nPathogenesis of thrombosis in unstable angina. Plaque rupture of the thinned, weak fibrous cap infiltrated by macrophages and overlying a pool of lipid in the arterial wall initiates the acute thrombotic event of unstable angina. Thrombosis may be advanced within minutes. Most lesions that precede plaque rupture are minor (less than 50% stenosis); thus, thrombus greatly contributes to sudden flow limitation and onset of symptoms. If thrombosis can be totally blocked (not possible with current antithrombotic agents), clinical events should be preventable, and endogenous thrombolysis may be possible within days. Local and systemic factors contribute to arterial thrombosis. With type III injury (fissure into plaque or media) platelet-rich thrombus anchors in the fissure, tracks along the site of deep injury, extends into the lumen, and requires the highest blood level of specific thrombin inhibition (a molar concentration that inhibits the total concentration of prothrombin in circulating blood). Thus, the thrombin content requiring inhibition in type III injury is highest. Local factors for thrombosis associated with type III injury include the rheology of blood flow (increased shear rate forces platelets to the periphery) and substrates in the arterial wall. Plaque substrates include the more thrombogenic collagens (types I and III and diabetic or glycosylated collagen), tissue thromboplastin, lipid gruel, thrombin bound to arterial wall matrix, and decreased prostacyclin. There is a direct relation between platelet deposition (thrombus) and local vasoconstriction, which may perpetuate each other. Thrombus as a substrate is more thrombogenic than type III arterial injury. \nOssified mucin-secreting choroid plexus adenoma: case report. This is the first report of a fully documented case of an ossified mucin-producing benign choroid plexus tumor. This was a chance finding in a man who complained only of posttraumatic low back discomfort. The ossification of the tumor appears to have been therapeutic. Mucin production may be a defense mechanism. \nIncreased incidence of lymphoproliferative disorder after immunosuppression with the monoclonal antibody OKT3 in cardiac-transplant recipients BACKGROUND. A sudden increase in the incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder among the patients in our cardiac-transplantation program was temporally related to introduction of the immunosuppressive drug OKT3. This monoclonal antibody has come to be widely used in recent years both to prevent and to treat rejection after cardiac transplantation. METHODS. In order to identify variables that predict the development of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, we analyzed retrospectively a series of 154 consecutive cardiac-transplant recipients at a single institution. Univariate analyses and multivariate analysis by logistic regression were performed. RESULTS. Among 75 patients who did not receive OKT3, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder developed in 1 (1.3 percent), as compared with 9 of 79 patients who received the drug (11.4 percent); the incidence among the OKT3-treated patients was ninefold higher (odds ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 54.7). According to multivariate analysis, the only factor significantly associated with the development of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder was the use of OKT3 (P = 0.001). A significant increase in risk with increasing doses was also apparent: 4 of 65 patients who received a cumulative dose of 75 mg of OKT3 or less (6.2 percent) had post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, whereas 5 of 14 patients who received more than 75 mg had the disorder (35.7 percent; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION. The addition of OKT3 to the immunosuppressive regimen increases the incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder after cardiac transplantation, and the risk increases sharply after cumulative doses greater than 75 mg. We suggest that the risks and benefits of prophylactic OKT3 administration be reassessed in the light of these findings, particularly since the value of prophylactic immunotherapy in cardiac-transplant recipients remains to be clearly established. \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and complicated diverticular disease: a case-control study. Fifty patients with severe complications of diverticular disease were compared with two groups of 50 controls, matched for age and sex. The first control group (A) was randomly selected from all emergency hospital admissions, and the second group (B) from patients with uncomplicated diverticular disease. Of the 50 study patients, 24 (48 per cent) were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the time of admission compared with nine (18 per cent) of control group A and ten (20 per cent) of control group B. Both of these differences were statistically significant, indicating a strong association between the ingestion of NSAIDs and the development of severe complications of diverticular disease. \nIs there a link between fluoridated water and osteosarcoma? To test the hypothesis that fluoride is a risk factor for osteosarcoma, a case control study compared the complete residential fluoride histories of osteosarcoma patients with matched hospital-based controls. Fluoridation was not found to be a risk factor for osteosarcoma in the study population. The trend in the data from this small sample study suggests the hypothesis that a protective effect may exist against the formation of osteosarcoma for individuals consuming fluoridated water. \nPostoperative computed tomography study of pterygomaxillary separation during the Le Fort I osteotomy. Computed tomography (CT) was used postoperatively to assess the pterygomaxillary region in 12 orthognathic surgery patients who had had a Le Fort I osteotomy. Although pterygomaxillary separation was successful in all cases, in only 41.6% of the sides did fractures of the plate not occur. The incidence of low pterygoid plate fracture was 37.5% and that of high pterygoid plate fracture was 25%; 4.2% of sides showed a maxillary tuberosity fracture. Multiple fractures were observed in 8.3% of separated plates. Of 17 pterygoid plates judged clinically to be intact, only 10 were intact as assessed by CT. The significance of these findings and application of CT to evaluation of modifications to the Le Fort I osteotomy is discussed. \nInhibition of interferon-inducible gene expression by adenovirus E1A proteins: block in transcriptional complex formation. Infection with wild-type adenovirus 5, but not with a mutant lacking the E1A gene, prevented the induction by interferon (IFN) alpha of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in HeLaM cell lines that had been permanently transfected with chimeric CAT reporter genes driven by the transcriptional regulatory regions of the IFN-responsive genes 561 and 6-16. Similar inhibition of IFN-inducible CAT activity was observed in cells that were cotransfected with the same reporter genes and plasmids expressing either the E1A 289- or 243-amino acid protein. These proteins also prevented the induction of CAT activity by IFN-gamma from a cotransfected HLA-DR alpha-CAT gene. Experiments with E1A mutants mapped the inhibitory activity to amino acid residues 38-65 of these proteins. In a HeLa cell line permanently expressing the E1A 289-amino acid protein, the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus was not inhibited by IFN-alpha, suggesting a global blockade of IFN responses. In accord with this theory, induction of 561, 1-8, and (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase mRNAs by IFN was blocked in these cells at the transcriptional level. The observed transcriptional inhibition could be attributed to the lack of formation of the crucial IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcriptional complex. As shown by mobility shift assays, this complex was not formed in the nuclear extracts of IFN-treated adenovirus-infected cells or IFN-treated E1A-producing cells. These nuclear extracts were deficient in both ISGF3 alpha and ISGF3 gamma subunits. However, they did not block the formation of ISGF3 complex from exogenously added components. \nAcute airway obstruction in relapsing polychondritis: treatment with pulse methylprednisolone. We describe 2 adolescents with relapsing polychondritis who developed acute airway obstruction. Both were successfully treated with intravenous steroids for this complication following failure with oral steroids. Early respiratory tract involvement in younger patients seems predictive of a poor outcome and aggressive therapy with intravenous high dose steroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs appears to be indicated. \nScreening dyspepsia by serology to Helicobacter pylori. Owing to limited endoscopy resources, various screening strategies for endoscopy have been proposed. Helicobacter pylori can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity by serology, and therefore we assessed the effects on diagnostic accuracy and endoscopic workload of a policy of screening clinic patients with dyspepsia before endoscopy by a strategy based on age, Helicobacter pylori serology, and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 1153 patients were studied, of whom 842 were of known histological H pylori status (histology group) and 293 had serum assessed prospectively by in-house and commercial ELISAs for detection of IgG antibodies to H pylori. Overall, the screening strategy would have reduced endoscopy workload by 23.3% (95% confidence interval 20.9-25.8%) and would have had a sensitivity for detection of peptic ulcer of 97.4% (94.5-99.1%). No peptic ulcer or malignant disease was missed in the patients studied prospectively, but 6 of 192 peptic ulcers in the histology group would have been missed. A policy of screening young dyspeptic patients for H pylori by serology is more sensitive than symptom-based screening strategies, and may have an important role in reducing endoscopy workload. \nUse of secondary prophylaxis against myocardial infarction in the north of England OBJECTIVE--To record the use of secondary prophylactic drugs in patients discharged from hospital having had a myocardial infarction. DESIGN--Prospective postal questionnaire survey of a random one in two sample of general practitioners in the region. SETTING--The nine family practitioner committee areas within the Northern Regional Health Authority. PATIENTS--Patients who had had a myocardial infarction and were discharged to their general practitioner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Whether beta blockers or aspirin, or both, were given on discharge. RESULTS--Of 267 patients, 158 (59%) were treated suboptimally in that they did not receive a secondary prophylactic drug to which they had no contraindication. For most patients this entailed underuse of one drug, but 17 (6%) of patients received no treatment. beta Blockers were 2.5 times less likely to be used than aspirin. Treatment was not associated with the age or sex of the patient, risk of further infarction, or hospital of discharge. CONCLUSIONS--Secondary prophylaxis after myocardial infarction is practised haphazardly. It should be offered to all patients who can tolerate it, after a trial period to assess any side effects of the drugs if necessary. \nManagement of the medial canthal tendon in nasoethmoid orbital fractures: the importance of the central fragment in classification and treatment. The medial canthal tendon and the fragment of bone on which it inserts (\"central\" fragment) are the critical factors in the diagnosis and treatment of nasoethmoid orbital fractures. The status of the tendon, the tendon-bearing bone segment, and the fracture pattern define a clinically useful classification system. Three patterns of fracture are appreciated: type I--single-segment central fragment; type II--comminuted central fragment with fractures remaining external to the medial canthal tendon insertion; and type III--comminuted central fragment with fractures extending into bone bearing the canthal insertion. Injuries are further classified as unilateral and bilateral and by their extension into other anatomic areas. The fracture pattern determines exposure and fixation. Inferior approaches alone are advised for unilateral single-segment injuries that are nondisplaced superiorly. Superior and inferior approaches are required for displaced unilateral single-segment injuries, for bilateral single-segment injuries, and for all comminuted fractures. Complete interfragment wiring of all segments is stabilized by junctional rigid fixation. All comminuted fractures require transnasal wiring of the bones of the medial orbital rim (medial canthal tendon-bearing or \"central\" bone fragment). If the fracture does not extend through the canthal insertion, the canthus should not be detached to accomplish the reduction. \nPAF-induced bowel necrosis. Effects of vasodilators. Ischemic bowel necrosis in the rat is produced by injecting platelet-activating factor (PAF) intravenously. Since intestinal hypoperfusion is observed after PAF injection, we hypothesize that mesenteric vasoconstriction is the mechanism of bowel injury. We thus studied the effects of vasodilators in this model. We found that: (1) Phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615 (leukotriene antagonist) and PGE1 counteracted the PAF-induced mesenteric flow reduction and ameliorated the bowel injury. However, phenoxybenzamine and prazosin were relatively ineffective in correcting PAF-induced hypotension, showing that bowel injury can be prevented independently of the hypotensive state. (2) Nitroglycerin failed to prevent bowel injury, although it improved the mesenteric blood flow. Thus, in opposition to our initial hypothesis, correction of the mesenteric flow reduction induced by PAF does not always prevent intestineal necrosis. (3) Only phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615, and PGE1 ameliorated PAF-induced hemoconcentration and bowel injury. This suggests a correlation between vascular injury (expressed by \"leaky\" vessels and the consequent hemoconcentration) and bowel necrosis. (4) Although both nitroglycerin and hydralazine relax smooth muscle, hydralazine seemed to aggravate bowel necrosis. The mechanism remains unclear. \nGreater loop chloride uptake contributes to blunted pressure natriuresis in Dahl salt sensitive rats. A blunted pressure natriuretic response is present in Dahl salt sensitive rats. To determine whether this results from tubular or glomerular mechanisms, late proximal, early distal, and late distal micropuncture were performed in salt resistant (R), salt sensitive (S), or salt sensitive rats with renal perfusion reduced to that of R rats (S-AC). Differences in neuro-endocrine background between groups were eliminated by renal denervation and by fixing plasma aldosterone, norepinephrine, and vasopressin levels by infusion. Renal perfusion pressure was greater (P less than 0.05) and inulin clearance less (P less than 0.05) in S than R rats. Urinary sodium excretion, however, was not different. S-AC had renal perfusion pressures that were similar to R rats and inulin clearance similar to S rats. Urinary NaCl excretion was less (P less than 0.05) than either group. Single nephron inulin clearance, fluid, and chloride delivery to late proximal sites were not different between groups. Absolute and fractional chloride delivery to early distal sites was less (P less than 0.05) in S-AC than R or S but not different between R and S. Late distal chloride delivery was not different between any group. Calculated loop chloride reabsorption was greater in S-AC than R or S. Thus, the lower urinary NaCl excretion in S-AC rats is in part due to increased loop chloride reabsorption. This effect is probably intrinsic to the S kidney as it occurs despite renal denervation when plasma levels of vasopressin, norepinephrine, and aldosterone are fixed. The increased loop chloride uptake is abolished when perfusion pressure increases. \nFistula-in-ano in Crohn's disease. Results of aggressive surgical treatment. The outcome of aggressive surgical treatment of 64 symptomatic anal fistulas in 55 patients with Crohn's disease has been studied. Forty-one fistulas, in 33 patients, were treated by conventional fistulotomy (17 subcutaneous, 19 intersphincteric, 5 low transsphincteric fistulas). Thirty wounds (73 percent) healed within 3 months and eight more wounds (93 percent) healed within 6 months. Three wounds did not heal within 12-18 months. Two of these patients subsequently required proctocolectomy. Wound healing was not influenced by the presence of rectal Crohn's disease or granulomatous inflammation in the tract. No change in continence was experienced by 26 of the 33 patients who underwent fistulotomy. Three patients required proctocolectomy and the remaining four patients experienced minor degrees of incontinence postoperatively. Sixteen high transsphincteric, five suprasphincteric, and one extrasphincteric fistula in 22 patients were treated by laying open external tracts and placing a noncutting seton through the sphincter, which was left in place for prolonged periods to maintain drainage. During follow-up (6 months to 10 years, median 2.5 years), three fistulas healed and seven remained quiescent. Nine patients required further treatment by a new seton and three patients required proctocolectomy. Eight of the 22 patients who had a seton inserted had no change in continence, and six patients in this group developed minor changes in continence, mostly related to diarrhea associated with intestinal disease. Anal fistulas in Crohn's disease, which involve minimal sphincter muscle, can be successfully treated by fistulotomy. High fistulas should be treated with seton drainage to limit recurrent suppuration and preserve sphincter function. \nClinical applications of carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography. During an 18-month period 33 patients in whom there were contraindications to the use of iodinated contrast arteriography underwent 40 carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriograms for lower extremity ischemia (19), severe hypertension and renal insufficiency (12), or arterial aneurysm (2). Contraindications to iodinated contrast agents included renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and contrast hypersensitivity. Sixteen aortic, 15 iliac-femoral-popliteal-tibial, five aorta-iliac-femoral and four aorta-iliac-femoral-popliteal-tibial carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography studies were performed. In 11 studies, imaging of selected arterial segments required the addition of 10 to 60 ml of dilute nonionic contrast. Guided by carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography studies four femoral-tibial bypasses, three aneurysmorrhaphies, two aortorenal bypasses, one aortofemoral bypass and one femoral-femoral bypass were successfully performed in 11 patients. In addition, carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography directed angioplasties of the common iliac (4), superficial femoral (6), popliteal (3), or tibioperoneal trunk (1) were performed in 10 patients. Complications of carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography included transient deterioration in renal function in three patients in whom 20 ml of nonionic contrast was used, a nonfatal myocardial infarction after a popliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in one patient, and transient tachypnea and tachycardia during a carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography study in one patient. Diagnostic arteriograms are obtainable using carbon dioxide as the contrast agent. Carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography permits patients with symptomatic arterial disease at high risk for contrast related complications to safely undergo arteriography and subsequent arterial reconstruction or endovascular intervention. \nMyocardial perfusion imaging with thallium-201 to evaluate patients before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Thallium-201 imaging may be used to help determine the distribution and amount of myocardium in jeopardy and the success of revascularization after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Single photon emission computed tomography is particularly advantageous because of its ability to differentiate vascular territories and thus evaluate patients with multivessel disease. Myocardial infarction resulting from complications such as distal embolization and side-branch occlusion can be detected. Thallium-201 imaging early after angioplasty may show abnormal results caused by transiently insufficient coronary flow reserve. However, studies performed 6 weeks or more after angioplasty accurately detect early restenosis and may identify those individuals likely to become symptomatic and eventually develop restenosis in the future. \nComparative experience with smooth and polyurethane breast implants using the Kaplan-Meier method of survival analysis. Smooth-walled silicone implants have been widely used in breast surgery. Capsular contracture, causing undesirable firmness and spherical deformity, has been a common problem. Recent studies suggest that polyurethane-covered breast implants are associated with a lower incidence of capsular contracture. The statistical methodology employed in some of these studies, however, may be subject to criticism. Between July of 1984 and June of 1990 (72 months), 427 polyurethane breast implants were used in 279 patients and 439 smooth prostheses were used in 250 patients for a variety of aesthetic and reconstructive procedures. The occurrence of capsular contracture was carefully monitored and then analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method of survival analysis. This method is particularly well suited to analysis of these types of clinical data because it allows for the fact that contractures occur at varying intervals after surgery and that follow-up of patients is incomplete. The probability of capsular contracture with smooth-walled prostheses was found to be significantly greater than with polyurethane-covered implants in each group of patients studied (p less than 0.05). Other complications occurred at a similar rate regardless of prosthesis type. This study supports the belief that polyurethane breast implants have a lower contracture rate; furthermore, it introduces the Kaplan-Meier method for analyzing the outcome of alternative plastic surgical therapies. \nLimb-sparing surgery in skeletally immature patients with osteosarcoma. The use of an expandable prosthesis. Limb-sparing surgery has a definite role in the treatment of osteosarcoma in children. Increased survival, however, raises problems of limb-length discrepancy and prosthetic longevity. The concept of an expandable adjustable prosthesis addresses the problem of leg-length discrepancy. The problem of prosthesis longevity will require further long-term evaluation of current designs and methods of fixation, as well as the development of a permanent prosthesis or biologic replacement. At skeletal maturity, the expandable prosthesis may either be maintained or substituted with another implant or biological alternative if warranted by the clinical situation. \nIdiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins. Nonthrombotic occlusion or stenosis of the mesenteric veins is a rare cause of intestinal ischemia that usually occurs in association with systemic vasculitis. The current report includes four male patients with segmental ischemic colitis caused by idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia in the small mesenteric veins and their intramural branches; neither vasculitis nor arterial involvement were present. Three of the four patients were less than or equal to 38 years of age; the fourth was 67. All four patients were previously healthy and had no history of drug use of any kind. Clinical findings included abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, and colonic strictures discovered by barium enema. The intima of the mesenteric and intestinal mural veins was focally thickened by a marked increase in cells and matrix between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina, whereas the vessel walls external to the thickened intima appeared normal. Histochemistry and immunoreactivity with antibodies to muscle-specific actins (HHF-35) disclosed that the intimal thickening was caused by proliferation of smooth muscle cells in a proteoglycan matrix. All patients recovered completely after segmental resection of the ischemic portion of the colon and had no recurrence of intestinal symptoms on follow-up of up to 7 years. These unusual venous lesions do not appear to have been previously described; their etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. \nIn situ human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in South African and British patients: evidence for putative HPV integration in vivo. In South Africa asymptomatic wart virus infection diagnosed by morphological criteria occurs in 16-20% of all ethnic groups; the incidence in black women is 66%. To identify human papillomavirus (HPV) types the prevalence of HPV in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in South African women (n = 72) with age matched British women (n = 73) was compared by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) using digoxigenin labelled probes for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35 on archival biopsy specimens. A higher proportion of British biopsy specimens (68%) contained HPV than those from South Africa (50%) in CIN 2 and 3; this difference was due to HPV 16. Thirty six per cent of the positive biopsy specimens from South African women also contained HPV 33/35 compared with 16% in the United Kingdom. There was no difference in HPV detection with age in either group. These data indicate that HPV types vary geographically, with \"minor\" HPV types being more common in South Africa. Three qualitatively distinct NISH signals were observed; a diffuse (type 1) signal in superficial cells, mainly koilocytes; a punctate signal (type 2) in basal/\"undifferentiated\" cells in CIN 3; and combined type 1 and 2 signals in CIN with wart virus infection (type 3). The punctate signal may represent HPV integration. \nA controlled study of caudal epidural injections of triamcinolone plus procaine for the management of intractable sciatica. The management of sciatica due to lumbar nerve root compromise remains controversial, probably because few well-controlled studies of conservative management have been performed. This preliminary study assesses the efficacy of epidural injections of 80 mg triamcinolone acetonide plus 0.5% procaine hydrochloride in saline, administered via the caudal route, in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial with 1 year follow-up. Twenty-three patients were entered into the study: 12 received treatment and 11 placebo. The active group showed significant pain relief (P = 0.02) and a significant increase in mobility (P = 0.01) at 4 weeks, which resulted in improved quality of life (P = 0.02). At 1 year, subjective and objective measures improved in both groups. The improvement was greater in the actively treated group, but only the objective assessment (straight leg raise) was statistically significant. \nA prospective study of incisional time, blood loss, pain, and healing with carbon dioxide laser, scalpel, and electrosurgery. Carbon dioxide laser incisions are reported to be less painful, less bloody, and less prone to seroma formation and to heal better than scalpel or electrosurgical incisions. We compared all three modalities in a prospective randomized study of cholecystectomy incisions. Time required for the incision and incisional blood loss was less with electrosurgery than with the carbon dioxide laser or scalpel. Postoperative pain and wound healing, however, were the same for all three techniques. The carbon dioxide laser appears to offer no advantage over conventional means of making a standard incision. \nGlial swelling following human cerebral contusion: an ultrastructural study. The ultrastructural features of cerebral contusion seen three hours to 11 days after head injury were studied in 18 patients undergoing surgery. Massive astrocytic swelling (\"cytotoxic\" oedema) was seen three hours to three days after injury, maximal in perivascular foot processes, and compressing some of the underlying capillaries. The tight junctions were not disrupted. Neuronal damage was most marked three to 11 days after injury. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to oedema formation and neuronal degeneration are discussed. \nExtraperitoneal approach for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by dense perianeurysmal fibrosis involving the adjacent organs. Attempts to isolate the aneurysm can lead to operative injuries of these structures, thus increasing the rates of complications and mortality. In the last 12 years 45 patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent aneurysm resection at the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Rome. The aneurysm was resected through a standard, midline transperitoneal approach in 39 patients, through a thoracophrenolaparotomy in two patients, and through a left-flank extraperitoneal approach in the last four patients. The extraperitoneal approach simplified aneurysm dissection and aortic clamping with no cases of postoperative morbidity or death. In addition, we reviewed the CT scan findings of 12 patients surgically treated for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. The amount of fibrosis in the anterior wall of the aneurysm was greater than in the left posterolateral aspect (p = 0.008). We conclude that the left-flank extraperitoneal approach is the most anatomically advantageous route for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. \nInduction of sustained patency after clot-selective coronary thrombolysis with Hybrid-B, a genetically engineered plasminogen activator with a prolonged biological half-life. BACKGROUND. Despite the utility of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in eliciting coronary thrombolysis clinically, early reocclusion remains a problem, occurring despite anticoagulation in 5-30% of patients with initially successful recanalization. This study evaluated the utility of Hybrid-B, a molecular variant of t-PA with a prolonged half-life in the circulation, in eliciting coronary thrombolysis and maintaining patency in the presence of a continuing thrombogenic stimulus. METHODS AND RESULTS. In intact, anesthetized dogs, either 18 mg Hybrid-B over 30 minutes (n = 15) or 50 mg t-PA (Activase) over 60 minutes (n = 8) was administered starting 60 minutes after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was induced with a thrombogenic copper coil. Time to lysis averaged 54 +/- 26 (means +/- SD) minutes and 64 +/- 34 minutes with Hybrid-B and t-PA, respectively (p = NS). When Hybrid-B was administered as a bolus (20 mg over 1 minute) to induce a high initial concentration in blood, time to lysis was shortened markedly and averaged 15 +/- 5 minutes. Dogs given Hybrid-B by either infusion or bolus exhibited prolonged time to reocclusion (337 +/- 192 minutes compared with 192 +/- 125 minutes in dogs given t-PA, p less than 0.03), reflecting maintenance of a subthrombolytic but persistently active concentration of activator in blood. Despite the persistence of Hybrid-B in blood, concentrations of fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin were not depleted markedly and remained at 77 +/- 25 and 56 +/- 24%, respectively, of control values. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, Hybrid-B, a novel variant of t-PA with unique pharmacokinetic properties, elicits prompt, sustained, and clot-selective coronary thrombolysis. \nThe use of masseter electromyography with electroneurography in the evaluation of facial paralysis. In the evaluation of facial paralysis, electroneurography provides a quantitative assessment of the degree of degeneration. Near the endpoint of degeneration, the facial musculature compound action potential may be contaminated by masseter artifact resulting from supramaximal stimulation. We propose the use of both masseter electromyography and electroneurography in the evaluation of advanced degeneration to better define the current level for supramaximal stimulation, to eliminate masseter artifact, and to more accurately assess the degree of facial nerve degeneration. \nUsefulness of weightlifting training in improving strength and maximal power output in coronary artery disease. The effects of 10 weeks (20 sessions) of combined weightlifting and aerobic training (n = 10) were compared with the effects of aerobic training alone (n = 8) on indexes of strength and aerobic exercise capacity in 18 men with coronary artery disease (CAD). Initial test performance was similar between groups. After aerobic training, the maximal load that could be lifted once only (1-repetition maximum) in single-arm curl, single-leg press and single-knee extension exercises increased by 13% (11.8 to 13.3 kg; p less than 0.01), 4% (97.0 to 101.0 kg; difference not significant) and 5% (28.2 to 29.7 kg; difference not significant), respectively; corresponding gains with combined weightlifting and aerobic training were 43% (12.2 to 17.4 kg; p less than 0.01), 21% (99.0 to 120.0 kg; p less than 0.01) and 24% (29.0 to 36.0 kg; p less than 0.01). After aerobic training, the initial 1-repetition maximum could be lifted an average of 4 times, compared with 14 times after combined training. Maximal progressive incremental cycle ergometer power output increased by 2% in the aerobic control group (1,088 to 1,113 kpm/min; difference not significant) and by 15% (1,030 to 1,180 kpm/min; p less than 0.05) in the experimental group. Cycling time at 80% of initial maximal power before attaining a Borg (0 to 10) rating of perceived exertion of 7 (very severe) increased by 11% (604 to 672 seconds; difference not significant) and by 109% (541 to 1,128 seconds; p less than 0.05) in the control and weight-trained patients, respectively. \nNeoplasms associated with pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma. We found a high prevalence of pulmonary and extrapulmonary neoplasms in patients with pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma (PEG) who were studied at our institution. Among 21 patients with PEG, 10 (48%) had associated benign (one patient) or malignant (nine patients) tumors. Patients with tumors were older at the time of diagnosis of PEG (48.9 vs 34.5 years). Tumors included three lung carcinomas, one pulmonary carcinoid tumor, two lymphomas, five extrapulmonary carcinomas, and one mediastinal ganglioneuroma. Two malignant neoplasms developed in each of two patients. Six tumors preceded, three followed, and three occurred concomitantly with the diagnosis of PEG. Slides from eight PEG-associated tumors and 18 control neoplasms from patients without PEG were also stained immunohistochemically for S100 protein. Four PEG-associated (50%) and 11 control (61%) tumors contained S100 protein-positive interstitial cells. Our study suggests, but does not prove, that there may be more than a random association between PEG and neoplasms. Cigarette smoking, moreover, is an important risk factor for both PEG and lung carcinomas. Our immunohistochemical findings indicate that S100 protein-positive cells in tumors usually bear little or no relationship to PEG. In patients with an underlying malignant neoplasm, PEG simulates pulmonary metastases clinically and, occasionally, histopathologically. \nOne hundred patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer treated by resection: analysis of prognostic determinants. One hundred patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer underwent 'radical' liver resection from 1980 to 1989. At least 1 cm of normal parenchyma surrounded the tumour and no microscopic invasion of resection margins was evident. The disease was staged according to our own staging system. Lobectomy was performed in 50 patients and non-anatomical resection in the remainder. The postoperative mortality rate was 5 per cent and the major morbidity rate was 11 per cent. The actuarial 5-year survival rate for patients in stages I, II and III was 42 per cent, 34 per cent and 15 per cent respectively (P less than 0.001). The overall actuarial 5-year survival rate was 30 per cent. The prognostic importance of various patient and tumour variables was evaluated by univariate analysis and then by multivariate analysis. Age of patient, site of primary, disease-free interval between treatment of primary and of hepatic metastases, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and number of metastases, did not relate to prognosis, while sex (P = 0.024), stage of primary (P = 0.026), extent of liver involvement (P less than 0.001), distribution of metastases (P = 0.01) and type of surgery (P = 0.028) significantly affected prognosis as single factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the extent of liver involvement and stage of the primary tumour were independent predictors of survival. We conclude that liver resection is effective in selected patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. In resectable patients it is not yet possible to formulate a clear prognosis based on clinical factors. The extent of liver involvement and the staging system used may be significant, although not absolute, indicators of outcome. \nSecondary erythrocytosis due to a cerebellar hemangioblastoma: demonstration of erythropoietin mRNA in the tumor. Cerebellar hemangioblastoma is a rare cause of secondary erythrocytosis. Although the erythrocytosis is a result of erythropoietin (Ep) stimulation, direct evidence of Ep synthesis by the tumor has been lacking. In an erythrocytotic patient with a cerebellar hemangioblastoma we found elevated levels of Ep in the tumor cyst fluid and for the first time demonstrated Ep mRNA in the tumor by Northern blotting. This finding confirms cerebellar hemangioblastoma as a site of ectopic Ep production. \nMidazolam use in the emergency department. Midazolam is a new imidazobenzodiazepine derivative that is two to three times as potent as diazepam, is water-soluble, has a rapid onset and short duration of action, and produces a profound amnestic effect. These properties make it an extremely useful drug for outpatient sedation. We performed retrospective review of midazolam use in a general emergency department over a one-year period. Midazolam was used in 120 patients, 71 men and 49 women, with an average age of 46 years. The average dose given was 3.4 mg, with a range of 1 to 10 mg. In 69 of the cases (57%) other drugs were administered, most commonly an opiate. There were only four adverse reactions. One patient developed urinary retention, one patient vomited, and two patients were somnolent for a prolonged period of time. There were no serious cardiovascular or respiratory problems. We conclude that midazolam is a safe drug to use in the emergency department. Close monitoring of the patient and the availability of airway support equipment are mandatory. \nRisk factors for falls as a cause of hip fracture in women. The Northeast Hip Fracture Study Group. BACKGROUND. Although even in the elderly most falls are not associated with fractures, over 90 percent of hip fractures are the result of a fall. Few studies have assessed whether the risk factors for falls are also important risk factors for hip fracture. METHODS. To examine the importance of risk factors for falls in the epidemiology of hip fracture, we performed a case-control study of 174 women (median age, 80 years) admitted with a first hip fracture to 1 of 30 hospitals in New York and Philadelphia. Controls, matched to the case patients according to age and hospital, were selected from general surgical and orthopedic surgical hospital services. Information was obtained by direct interview. RESULTS. As measured by the odds ratio, increased risks for hip fracture were associated with lower-limb dysfunction (odds ratio = 1.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.8), visual impairment (odds ratio = 5.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 13.9), previous stroke (odds ratio = 2.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 4.0), Parkinson's disease (odds ratio = 9.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 76.1), and use of long-acting barbiturates (odds ratio = 5.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 45.0). Of the controls, 44 (25 percent) had had a recent fall. The case patients were more likely than these controls to have fallen from a standing height or higher (odds ratio = 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 5.7). Of those with hip fracture the younger patients (less than 75 years old) were more likely than the older ones (greater than or equal to 75 years old) to have fallen on a hard surface (odds ratio = 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 3.7). CONCLUSIONS. A number of factors that have been identified as risk factors for falls are also associated with hip fracture, including lower-limb dysfunction, neurologic conditions, barbiturate use, and visual impairment. Given the prevalence of these problems among the elderly, who are at highest risk, programs to prevent hip fracture should include measures to prevent falls in addition to measures to slow bone loss. \nTumor markers in cancer of the colon and rectum. The primary role that tumor markers for cancer of the colon and rectum have at this time is for postoperative surveillance of those patients resected for cure who are at risk for recurrence of the disease. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels are followed by most surgeons prospectively after the potentially curative resection. This tumor marker has not been advocated as a screening test for these cancers; however, a preoperative CEA serum level is determined in those patients before the initial surgery for colon or rectal cancer. The serum level of CEA is mainly determined by tumor differentiation and stage of disease. If the CEA serum level begins to increase during the postoperative surveillance period, the recurrence of colon or rectal cancer must be suspected. Further investigations are then performed to identify the location and resectability of the recurrent disease. Monoclonal antibodies labeled with radioisotope are presently being used clinically to identify recurrence of colon and rectal cancer. Used in conjunction with elevated serum CEA levels (or other determinants of recurrent disease) these tumor markers can specifically identify site(s) of cancer recurrence. Theoretically, by attaching cancer-fighting agents (i.e., chemotherapeutic agents) to the monoclonal antibody, the site of tumor recurrence can be potentially treated, too. Hence, these \"tumor-seeking missiles\" may one day be used to treat cancer recurrence. \nFluid collections developing after pancreatic transplantation: radiologic evaluation and intervention. The usefulness of real-time sonography, duplex sonography, computed tomography (CT), cystography, diagnostic aspiration, and percutaneous drainage in the diagnosis and treatment of peri-pancreatic-transplant fluid collections was retrospectively assessed in 46 recipients of extraperitoneal pancreatic transplants. Forty-four abnormalities were identified in the extraperitoneal space at sonography, including four pancreatic pseudocysts associated with malfunction of the pancreatic duct, seven abscesses, six hematomas, nine urinomas, six early postoperative fluid collections that spontaneously resolved, six cases of pancreatitis, and six cases of vascular occlusion. Sonography (including pulsed Doppler sonography) was the procedure of choice in detecting fluid collections and diagnosing pancreatitis, rejection, vascular thrombosis, and pancreatic duct malfunction. CT was diagnostic in four of six hematomas; cystography was diagnostic in seven of nine urinomas. Sonographically guided percutaneous intervention enabled three patients to avoid surgery and allowed optimal surgical planning for six patients. \nReversible symptomatic biliary obstruction associated with ceftriaxone pseudolithiasis. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, has been associated with the development of sludge or stones in the gallbladders of some patients treated with this medication. Such precipitates, which are usually reversible upon discontinuation of the drug, sometimes cause symptoms, have simulated acute cholecystitis, and have even led to cholecystectomy in some cases. We report the first known instance of biliary obstruction and secondary pancreatitis in association with reversible ceftriaxone-induced pseudolithiasis. \nSerosal invasion as the single prognostic indicator in stage IIIA (T3N1M0) gastric cancer. Prognostic factors of gastric cancer with positive serosal invasion and regional lymph node metastasis were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Sixty-seven patients with the T3N1M0 subgroup of stage IIIA disease were evaluated, in which 34.9 +/- 13.4 nodes were dissected in extended lymph node dissection, and 6.5 +/- 6.2 were metastatic. Routine postoperative systemic chemotherapy with mitomycin C and N1-(2'-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil was administered. With this approach, the 5-year survival rate of stage IIIA disease was 47.6%. By Cox proportional hazards model, diameter of serosal invasion was the only significant determinant of prognosis in the T3N1M0 subgroup. The predicted 5-year survival rate for 24 patients with serosal invasion less than 3.0 cm in diameter was 59.5%, compared with 11.5% for 38 patients with invasion of 3.0 cm or larger in diameter. The number of metastatic nodes and the type of operation (total gastrectomy or less than total gastrectomy) did not affect the prognosis. When gastric cancer has both positive serosal invasion and metastatic regional lymph nodes, the diameter of serosal invasion is the more important factor for predicting prognosis. \nTyping of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ear infections related to outcome of treatment. Of 142 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) ear infections, 88 (62 per cent) had chronic otitis media and 54 (38 per cent) external otitis. Following serotyping and pyocin typing of their bacteria, and relating the type to outcome, patients could be divided into three groups: (1) 120 patients who had no recurrence with isolation of only one PSA strain, (2) 13 patients who had recurrent infections and in whom the same PSA strain was isolated in repeated cultures, and (3) nine patients who had recurrent disease, but who had a change in their PSA strains. Most of the PSA strains isolated from patients in groups (1) and (2) were stable to pyocin, and resistent to gentamicin. Patients in the first group were all cured initially by medical management. Of the nine patients in group (3) who had a different serotype on repeated cultures, medical treatment was successful in eight (89 per cent), but of the 13 patients in group (2) who had the same Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype cultured, medical therapy failed in six (46 per cent) and mastoid surgery was required. Serotyping of Pseudomonas aeruginosa otitis may be helpful in predicting the type of management in patients who have recurrent infections. \nDeep UV photochemistry of chemisorbed monolayers: patterned coplanar molecular assemblies. Deep ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is shown to modify organosilane self-assembled monolayer (SAM) films by a photocleavage mechanism, which renders the surface amenable to further SAM modification. Patterned UV exposure creates alternating regions of intact SAM film and hydrophilic, reactive sites. The exposed regions can undergo a second chemisorption reaction to produce an assembly of SAMs in the same molecular plane with similar substrate attachment chemistry. The UV-patterned films are used as a template for selective buildup of fluorophores, metals, and biological cells. \nPositron tomographic assessment of 16 alpha-[18F] fluoro-17 beta-estradiol uptake in metastatic breast carcinoma. The positron-emitting estrogenic steroid 16 alpha-[18F]fluoro-17 beta-estradiol (FES) has been shown to exhibit selective uptake in primary breast carcinomas; the uptake of tracer by positron emission tomography (PET) is strongly correlated with the tumor estrogen-receptor concentration. We have now extended the use of this radiopharmaceutical for imaging of metastases of breast carcinoma by PET in 16 patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. Increased uptake of FES was identified on PET images in 53 of 57 metastatic lesions (93%); only two apparent false-positive foci of FES uptake were seen. In seven of the patients, evaluable PET studies were obtained both before and after initiation of antiestrogen therapy. In all cases, there was a decrease in FES uptake in the tumor deposits after initiation of antiestrogen therapy, and the mean (+/- standard deviation) uptake decreased from 2.22 (+/- 1.23) to 0.80 (+/- 0.42) x 10(3)+ dose/ml. These results indicate that PET with FES has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting metastatic breast carcinoma and provide additional confirmatory evidence that the tumor uptake of this ligand is a receptor-mediated process. \nAcute dacryocystic retention cured by inferior turbinate infracturing. A 30-year-old man with recurrent acute dacryocystic retention had successful infracturing of the inferior turbinate bone in association with probing of the lacrimal outflow system. Enlargement of the inferior nasal meatus by fracturing the turbinate is easy to do and would be indicated before recommending a dacryocystorhinostomy in cases of acute dacryocystic retention in which the causative cast is difficult to eliminate even by large probes that can be passed down the nasolacrimal duct. \nAnti-CD18 antibody attenuates neutropenia and alveolar capillary-membrane injury during gram-negative sepsis. Activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) associated with sepsis. Adhesion of activated PMNs to endothelial monolayers is mediated by the CD18 adhesion-receptor complex on the PMN cell surface. Monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) blocks CD18-dependent PMN-endothelial adhesion in vitro and in vivo. This study was designed to determine the role of CD18-dependent PMN adhesion in ALI associated with gram-negative sepsis. Anesthetized, ventilated (FiO2 0.5, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O) pigs received sterile saline (control, n = 8) or live Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 x 10(8) colony-forming units/ml at 0.3 ml/20 kg/min (septic, n = 9) for 1 hour. A third group (n = 7) received MoAb 60.3, 2 mg/kg intravenously, 15 minutes before Pseudomonas infusion. Animals were studied for 300 minutes. MoAb 60.3 significantly (p less than 0.05) attenuated the neutropenia seen in sepsis (15 +/- 1 vs 6 +/- 1 x 10(3) PMNs/mm3 at 300 min). Alveolar-capillary membrane injury was assessed by bronchoalveolar-lavage protein content and extravascular lung water determination. MoAb 60.3 significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced BAL protein at 300 minutes (388 +/- 75 vs 1059 +/- 216 micrograms/ml in septic animals) and attenuated the increase in extravascular lung water to 240 minutes (7.1 +/- 2 vs 14.2 +/- 1.2 ml/kg in septic animals). Systemic hypotension, decreased cardiac index, pulmonary hypertension, and relative hypoxemia, all characteristic of this model, were not altered by MoAb 60.3. These data suggest that, in this model of septic ALI, neutropenia is, in part, CD18 dependent and that blocking CD18-dependent PMN adhesion protects the alveolar-capillary membrane independently of altered hemodynamic status. \nEvidence for central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, not imidazoline binding sites, mediating the ethanol-attenuating properties of alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists. The role of central adrenoceptors in the ethanol-attenuating effects of alpha-2 adrenoceptor blockers was investigated in mice; the centrally active antagonist atipamezole was compared with L 659,066, which penetrates the brain poorly. L 659,066 (1-10 mg/kg) had no effect on the hypothermia induced by ethanol (2 g/kg) or ethanol ataxia (2.4 g/kg), whereas atipamezole (1 mg/kg) significantly attenuated both ethanol-induced hypothermia and ataxia. Atipamezole (1-3 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the ethanol-induced reduction in exploratory head-dipping in a holeboard test whereas L 659,066 was only effective at a dose of 1 mg/kg, higher doses (3 and 10 mg/kg) and a lower dose (0.3 mg/kg) were ineffective. Atipamezole was without effect on ethanol's locomotor stimulant effect in the holeboard but L 659,066 attenuated this effect at doses less than 3 mg/kg Many alpha-2 adrenoceptor ligands also have affinity for nonadrenergic imidazoline-binding sites. The role these sites may play in attenuating ethanol's effects was investigated by comparing RX 821002 (methoxy idazoxan), which has little or no affinity for imidazoline-binding sites with atipamezole. Both atipamezo 1 e (1 mg/kg) and RX 821002 (0.06-0.2 mg/kg) significantly attenuated ethanol-induced hypothermia, ataxia and reduction in head-dipping, but were without effect on ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation. These results suggest that nonadrenergic imidazoline-binding sites are not implicated in the ethanol-attenuating properties of alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists. \nPulmonary oedema following relief of upper airway obstruction in the Pierre-Robin syndrome: a consequence of early palatal repair? Pulmonary oedema occurred following relief of an acute upper airway obstruction in an infant with Pierre-Robin syndrome undergoing cleft palate repair. We anticipate an increased prevalence of this phenomenon in view of the present trend for early palatal repair, and would advocate the routine use of a nasopharyngeal airway after operation in infants with severe micrognathia. \nAssessing the denominator problem in community-oriented primary care. Determination of health care needs is an essential cornerstone of community-oriented primary care (COPC). Many physicians, lacking research resources, may generalize their own patient registry data to the community. But practice populations are likely to differ significantly from community populations. This study compared demographics, health status, and medical care utilization in a sample of 990 elderly living in the community and 250 elderly patients registered at the St. Elizabeth Hospital Family Health Center in Youngstown, Ohio. The community survey and patient registries were comparable on key demographic characteristics. But statistically significant differences were observed for functional status and a number of chronic medical conditions. Comparisons of symptomatology, use of health aides, subjective health status, depression, and stress produced no significant differences. Overall health care utilization patterns were similar. The elderly family health center patients were more representative of the non-institutionalized elderly in the community than expected. And although the clinical significance remains uncertain, these findings suggest that this practice sample may be used with caution for COPC planning. But considerably more research must be undertaken in a variety of practice settings before the use of practice populations for COPC planning is widely applied. \nComparison of thermodilution and transthoracic electrical bioimpedance cardiac outputs. Current methods of measuring cardiac output require the invasive insertion of a thermodilution catheter with its concomitant risks and complications. We examined the noninvasive method of transthoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) in comparison with thermodilution cardiac outputs in a sample of 44 critically ill patients with poor left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%) and with either ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Dyspnea, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and difference between real and ideal weight had the most marked effects on the correlation between the two methods, with lesser influence by left ventricular ejection fraction, height, weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and aortic regurgitation. TEB and thermodilution cardiac outputs were correlated, at r = 0.51 (p less than 0.00009), but the low reliability and low percentage of TEB readings within 0.5 L/min of thermodilution cardiac outputs (31%) renders TEB inadequate for clinical measurement of cardiac outputs in this patient population. \nRationale for treatment. Based on substantial evidence, the 1984 NIH Consensus Development Conference concluded that the treatment of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol elevations with diet and, when necessary, with drugs, can reduce the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Accordingly, in 1988 the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) published guidelines for defining moderate-, borderline-high-, and high-risk categories for CAD. Many clinical trials have supported the benefits of antihyperlipidemic therapy. Evidence from the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial gave rise to the \"2:1 ratio,\" i.e., that a 1% reduction in total cholesterol level is associated with a 2% decrease in CAD events. The Helsinki Heart Study results indicated that additional benefit may be obtained by raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Dramatic reductions in LDL and total cholesterol were achieved by the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias, which also achieved a 35% reduction in CAD events and a two-thirds reduction in both coronary bypass operations and angioplasties. Long-term benefits of cholesterol lowering in terms of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality have been shown in the Coronary Drug Project and the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. Two major studies that have documented angiographic changes as a result of cholesterol lowering are the Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) and the Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS). In both CLAS and FATS, there was a decrease in the development of new lesions and a lowering of the rate of progression of existing lesions. In FATS, there was also evidence that aggressive antihyperlipidemic therapy will decrease existing lesions in some CAD patients. \nPostoperative radiotherapy in the management of spinal cord ependymoma. Fifty-eight patients with histologically verified spinal cord ependymomas were treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital and Atkinson Morley's Hospital between 1950 and 1987. The median age in this series was 40 years (range 1 to 79 years) and the male:female ratio was 1.8:1. Ten patients had tumors in the cervical cord and 10 in the thoracic cord; 14 tumors involved the conus medullaris and 24 the cauda equina. Forty ependymomas were grade I and 13 were grades II to IV (in five patients there was insufficient material for grading). Eleven patients underwent biopsy only, 33 had partial or subtotal resection, and 14 had complete resection. Forty-three patients received postoperative radiotherapy. The median follow-up period was 70 months (range 3 to 408 months). Cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 68% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. On univariate analysis, age, histological grade, postoperative neurological function, and era of treatment were significant prognostic factors for survival. The histological grade was the only significant independent prognostic factor. The relative risk of death from ependymoma was 9.0 for patients with tumor grades II to IV compared to grade I (p less than 0.005, 95% confidence interval 2.7 to 30). The survival rates of patients following complete excision were significantly better compared to those after incomplete surgery (p less than 0.025). The majority of completely resected neoplasms were low-grade cauda equina tumors. Despite incomplete surgery, 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates following radical radiotherapy were both 59%, and cause-specific survival rates were 69% at 5 years and 62% at 10 years. This suggests that radiotherapy may achieve long-term tumor control in over half of those patients with residual spinal ependymoma. \nThe morphometric histopathology of undescended testes and testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernia: a comparative study. The underlying injury to undescended testes may be hormonal, a transient perinatal form fruste of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism characterized by blunting of the surge in gonadotropins normally seen at age 60 to 90 days. Ischemia is the underlying injury to testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias. To determine if the histopathology of these 2 injuries is different histomorphometric analyses were performed on semithin microscopic sections of biopsies of 21 control testes, 17 undescended testes and 13 intrascrotal testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias. The infants in all groups were 30 to 120 days old. The results showed that, as in previous studies, undescended testes at this age are characterized by hypoplasia of Leydig cells, normal germ cell counts and defective maturation of gonocytes into adult dark spermatogonia. In contrast, testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias were characterized by hyperplasia of Leydig cells, reduced germ cell counts and normal maturation of gonocytes into adult dark spermatogonia. One might conclude that the underlying injury of undescended testes, presumably the blunted surge of gonadotropins, causes a primary hypoplasia and hypofunction of Leydig cells, which in turn causes a secondary defect in transformation of gonocytes into spermatogonia. In contrast, ischemia may primarily cause a tubular epithelial lesion leaving the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis intact and allowing normal transformation of gonocytes into spermatogonia. Reduced gonadotropins and ischemia appear to produce distinctly different primary and secondary pathophysiological effects on the testes. \nLaser-assisted angioplasty in the treatment of prosthetic graft stenosis. Late failure of peripheral bypass grafts has been treated primarily by secondary reconstruction. Laser-assisted angioplasty is an optional therapy that the authors investigated in 28 prosthetic grafts over a two-year period. Twenty-five symptomatic patients with 28 peripheral prosthetic arterial bypass grafts (25 polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] grafts and 1 each of knitted Dacron, Teflon, and umbilical vein) demonstrated graft occlusion (25) or high-grade stenoses (3). All patients underwent standard laser-assisted angioplasty using a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser source and hybrid probe. Twenty-one grafts (75%) were successfully recanalized with adequate restoration of flow through the conduit. All 7 failures were in occluded PTFE grafts that presented with either recalcitrant lesions (5) or perforations (2) at the distal anastomoses. There have been 3 long-term failures (14%) to date in the successfully treated group, all in PTFE grafts. Two patients suffered recurrent thrombosis and 1 developed an inexplicable graft infection five months after laser treatment. Laser-assisted angioplasty appears to be a clinically viable alternative treatment for prosthetic graft stenosis and recanalization of grafts occluded at their distal anastomosis. \nIn vivo use of a radioiodinated somatostatin analogue: dynamics, metabolism, and binding to somatostatin receptor-positive tumors in man Somatostatin analogues, labeled with gamma-emitting radionuclides, are of potential value in the localization of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors with gamma camera imaging. We investigated the application in man of a radioiodinated analogue of somatostatin, 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide, which has similar biologic characteristics as the native peptide. The radiopharmaceutical is cleared rapidly from the circulation (up to 85% of the dose after 10 min) mainly by the liver. Liver radioactivity is rapidly excreted into the biliary system. Until 3 hr after injection, radioactivity in the circulation is mainly in the form of 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide. Thereafter, plasma samples contain increasing proportions of free iodide. Similarly, during the first hours after injection, radioactivity in the urine exists mainly in the form of the unchanged peptide. Thereafter, a progressive increase in radioiodide excretion is observed, indicating degradation of the radiopharmaceutical in vivo. Fecal excretion of radioactivity amounts to only a few percent of the dose. The calculated median effective dose equivalent is comparable with values for applications of other 123I-radiopharmaceuticals (0.019 mSv/MBq). \nMyocardial echinococcosis with perforation into the pericardium. Though rare, cardiac echinococcosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiac tumors, particularly in patients originating from endemic areas or with manifestation of hydatid disease in other organs. Diagnosis and localisation of the cysts is best accomplished with non-invasive methods such as 2-D transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography and NMR. Excision of the cardiac cyst from the interventricular septum in a 21 year old patient with polyvisceral echinococcosis was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass. Adjunctive medical therapy with mebendazol is being continued for 24 months postoperatively. Twelve months after surgery the patient is asymptomatic without echocardiographic signs of recurrence. \nVitamin B6 is effective therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Fifty-nine women completed a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Thirty-one patients received vitamin B6, 25-mg tablets orally every 8 hours for 72 hours, and 28 patients received placebo in the same regimen. Patients were categorized according to the presence of vomiting: severe nausea (score greater than 7) or mild to moderate nausea (score of 7 or less). The severity of nausea (as graded on a visual analogue scale of 1-10 cm) and the number of patients with vomiting over a 72-hour period were used to evaluate response to therapy. Twelve of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had a pre-treatment nausea score greater than 7 (severe) (mean 8.2 +/- 0.8), as did ten of 28 patients in the placebo group (mean 8.7 +/- 0.9) (not significant). Following therapy, there was a significant difference in the mean \"difference in nausea\" score (ie, baseline - post-therapy nausea) between patients with severe nausea receiving vitamin B6 (mean 4.3 +/- 2.1) and placebo (mean 1.8 +/- 2.2) (P less than .01). In patients with mild to moderate nausea and in the group as a whole, no significant difference between treatment and placebo was observed. Fifteen of 31 vitamin B6-treated patients had vomiting before therapy, compared with ten of 28 in the placebo group (not significant). At the completion of 3 days of therapy, only eight of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had any vomiting, compared with 15 of 28 patients in the placebo group (P less than .05). \nEffect of otitis media on infrared tympanic thermometry. This study was designed to determine if temperature readings using a new tympanic thermometer are affected by otitis media. These readings were also compared to a rectal or oral temperature. Eighty-four children with unilateral suppurative or non-suppurative otitis media diagnosed clinically by their pediatricians were enrolled in the study. Temperatures were measured in both ears using the Thermoscan PRO-1 Instant Thermometer and rectally or orally by a glass or electronic predictive thermometer. For 67 children with unilateral suppurative otitis media the mean temperature in infected ears was 0.38 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in uninfected ears (p = .005). Neither temperatures measured in affected nor those from unaffected ears differed significantly from oral or rectal control readings. For 17 children with unilateral non-suppurative otitis media there was no statistically significant difference between temperatures in affected and unaffected ears or between the temperatures in either ear and the oral or rectal control. Our data show that temperatures taken in ears with suppurative otitis media are slightly higher than those in normal ears. This difference is of minimal clinical significance and does not affect the accuracy when compared to oral or rectal control readings. \nElectrophysiologic analysis of early Parkinson's disease. We have been interested in the application of quantitative measures of motor performance as a possible means of early detection of Parkinson's disease. To assess motor function, we have measured movement time (the physiologic correlate of bradykinesia) and reaction time (simple and directional choice) with an upper limb motor task, and tremor with accelerometry and electromyographic recordings. In this report we describe preliminary data from a Parkinson's disease patient group with symptoms of fewer than 2 years' average duration (compared with an age- and gender-matched normal control group) which indicate that precise, quantitative tests of motor function can detect the slight deviations from normal that are present in early Parkinson's disease. It appears that tests of bradykinesia are most sensitive, and detection of rest tremor is most specific. These tests may be applicable in screening individuals who are suspected of having or are \"at risk for\" Parkinson's disease and other related disorders. \nInguinal endometriosis: pathogenetic and clinical implications. In six women with a preoperative diagnosis of incarcerated hernia, surgical exploration of the groin revealed inguinal endometriosis and no hernia. The affected structure was always the extraperitoneal portion of the round ligament. Six of the seven lesions were on the right. Intraperitoneal endometriosis was demonstrated in all patients. Catamenial pain was the pathognomonic symptom in the differential diagnosis of the inguinal mass. Gynecologists and surgeons should bear in mind the possibility that endometriosis may be the cause of symptoms of a suspected incarcerated inguinal hernia. Should this disease be detected at inguinal exploration, a laparoscopy is indicated during the same operation. \nMalignant hepatic tumors: P-31 MR spectroscopy with one-dimensional chemical shift imaging. To determine the clinical feasibility and applicability of phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and to assess its potential for characterization of human hepatic tissue, one-dimensional chemical shift imaging (CSI) was performed in 37 patients with various malignant hepatic neoplasms (30 metastases from a variety of primary tumors and seven hepatocellular carcinomas) and seven healthy volunteers. Tumors were grouped according to the percentage of the analyzed section that was occupied by tumor: less than 50% (group A) or more than 50% (group B). In group B, all phosphomonoester/beta-adenosine triphosphate ratios were significantly higher than normal (P less than .001). Hepatocellular carcinomas and metastases from various primary neoplasms could not be differentiated on the basis of spectral characteristics and metabolite ratios. Limitations of one-dimensional surface coil CSI prevented separation of spectra of small tumors and tumors deep within the liver parenchyma from spectra of normal liver parenchyma. \nMonocyte zinc and in vitro prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-1 beta production by cultured peripheral blood monocytes in patients with Crohn's disease. This study investigated the relationship between zinc status and prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-1 beta production by cultured monocytes in patients with Crohn's disease. Monocyte zinc was significantly decreased in both 12 inpatients and 22 outpatients compared with controls (P less than 0.001) but lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear cell zinc were normal. When cultured monocytes from 10 outpatients with Crohn's disease were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, prostaglandin E2 production increased markedly, coupled with a fall in monocyte zinc. In matched controls, prostaglandin E2 production was significantly less and monocyte zinc remained stable. No difference in interleukin-1 release was noted between patients and controls. The addition of prednisolone to cell cultures suppressed prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1 synthesis, and monocyte zinc did not change. Zinc chloride augmented prostaglandin E2 production in patients, but not controls, and interleukin-1 remained stable. These results demonstrate a link between low monocyte zinc concentration and excessive prostaglandin production in patients with Crohn's disease. \nDepression and chronic fatigue in the workplace. Workers' compensation and occupational issues. There is ample evidence that some forms of depression can be caused or aggravated by work. The relationship of work and chronic fatigue syndrome is questionable, but elements at work can aggravate the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. The role of physicians who can support or discourage beliefs about physical illness is all important, both by what they say and how they treat. In the process of interaction, they can promote or discourage disability. The role of the physician in the workplace is to determine if an illness is work related, if it is disabling, if it requires treatment, and what treatment. The physician must advise if the worker can continue in his or her usual and customary employment and, if not, if he or she can be vocationally rehabilitated from a medical standpoint. Conditions in which physical symptoms are unsupported by physical findings and have diagnostic labels that describe the disorder without indicating either cause or pathology are especially troubling for the physician who must decide if the patient's job caused the symptoms. \nPractice patterns and costs of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We conducted an observational study at three hospitals in Boston to examine the patterns of practice and the costs involved in the medical management of noncirrhotic, upper gastrointestinal bleeding. A total of 111 patients were identified and studied: 42 from hospital 1, 38 from hospital 2, and 31 from hospital 3. There were no significant differences in the management of the patients, except for the more frequent use of upper gastrointestinal radiography at hospital 3 and the more frequent use of cimetidine at hospital 2. Only a small percentage (3-7%) of patients required surgery, and overall mortality (0-8%) was low. The average cost of hospitalization, determined by using the New England Medical Center cost model, was calculated for direct costs ($3,180). The majority of costs incurred were for hospital bed or intensive care unit stay (63%) and transfusion of blood products (14%), with costs for physicians' services (9%), endoscopy (2%), and upper gastrointestinal radiography (1%) accounting for only a small percentage. This study demonstrates remarkable similarity in practice patterns and resource utilization at three different hospitals and provides data on the actual costs involved in hospitalization for noncirrhotic, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. \nSurgical correction of coarctation in early infancy: does surgical technique influence the result? Between 1979 and 1988, a total of 53 infants less than 1 year of age underwent repair of coarctation. Thirty-seven patients (70%) were younger than 3 months. Median age was 0.9 month. Four different surgical techniques were used: resection with end-to-end anastomosis, patch enlargement, subclavian flap aortoplasty, and subclavian displacement aortoplasty (Meier-Mendonca technique). Hospital mortality was 7.5% and was limited to patients with additional complex intracardiac defects. Neither age nor surgical technique had an influence on the operative risk. Follow-up averaged 15 to 43 months for the four different groups. Restenosis developed in 9 (19%) of 47 patients regularly followed up, 5 (11%) of whom have had reoperation. Age at operation was not a predictor for restenosis, which occurred in 17.4% of patients less than 1 month and 20.8% of those greater than 1 month of age at operation. Patch enlargement and the subclavian displacement technique demonstrated the highest restenosis rates (42% and 43%, respectively). However, patients who underwent patch enlargement had less favorable pathological conditions. It is concluded that results of coarctation repair in early infancy do not depend as much on the operative method itself as on the specific pathological aspect, which largely determines the method of treatment. Some reservation must be made in regard to the subclavian displacement technique. \nCharacterization of target injury of murine acute graft-versus-host disease directed to multiple minor histocompatibility antigens elicited by either CD4+ or CD8+ effector cells. The precise identity of effector mononuclear cells capable of eliciting acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD) is controversial. In this study, highly purified subsets of donor T cells were used to produce AGVHD to multiple minor histocompatibility (H) antigens in two strain combinations of mice matched for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In the C3H.SW- greater than B6 strain combination, only CD8+ effector cells produced histologic evidence of AGVHD in skin and liver, which peaked 3 weeks after transplant. In the B10.D2- greater than DBA/2 strain combination, CD4+ effector cells, and to a lesser extent, CD8+ cells, mediated disease in skin, liver, and intestine, which peaked during the fourth week after transplant. Analysis of skin and liver from both combinations showed target cell injury that was phenotypically similar and resembled that previously described in human disease in other studies. In addition, prominent epithelial injury also was detected in oropharyngeal mucosa, esophagus, hepatobiliary ducts, and seminal vesicle in both transplant settings. These findings indicate that functionally different subsets of donor T cells may be capable of initiating common pathways of cellular injury in selected target sites in AGVHD, and have potential implications for strategies that seek to ablate disease development by manipulation of donor marrow before transplantation. \nDiarrhea, respiratory infections, and growth are not affected by a weekly low-dose vitamin A supplement: a masked, controlled field trial in children in southern India. Incidence, duration, and severity of diarrhea and respiratory symptoms were monitored weekly for 1 y in 15,419 children 6-60 mo of age in a randomized, placebo-controlled, masked clinical trial conducted in southern India. Half the children received weekly doses of 8.7 mumol (2500 microgram) vitamin A and 46 mumol (20 mg) vitamin E (treated) and the other half, 46 mumol vitamin E (control). Medical and ocular examinations and anthropometric measurements were obtained before and after 52 wk of intervention. Ocular examinations also were obtained after 26 wk. Supplements were delivered weekly from calibrated dispenser bottles by community health volunteers who also recorded each mother's recall of daily morbidity of her child during the previous week. Baseline characteristics of treated and control subjects were similar and documented a prevalence of 11% xerophthalmia and 72% undernutrition. Weekly treatment with the low-dose vitamin A supplement did not influence the incidence, severity, or duration of diarrhea or respiratory infections and did not influence linear or ponderal growth. \nAlcoholism in women. Women differ from men in their drinking patterns and in the biologic consequences of alcohol use. Women more often drink at home and conceal their drinking behavior. Because women have a higher percentage of body fat and a lower percentage of body water than men, the same amount of alcohol causes more severe toxic effects in women than in men. Heavy alcohol consumption in women is associated with gynecologic dysfunction and fetal alcohol syndrome. Depression, anxiety or other psychiatric illness is also common in women alcoholics. Family physicians should be alert to the subtle behaviors that suggest alcoholism and be familiar with the available community resources and treatment options. \nTransperineurial vessel constriction in an edematous neuropathy. The hypothesis that the accumulation of endoneurial edema can exert forces sufficient to occlude transperineurial ve",
