        "text": "r 2 hours before death. Epicardial coronary diameters at arteriography and extent of thrombus deposition at serial histological sections were analyzed in controls (n = 20) and in dogs pretreated with superoxide dismutase (SOD, a superoxide radical scavenger, n = 10); other dogs were pretreated with the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase (n = 8), the iron chelator deferoxamine (n = 6), or the hydroxyl radical scavenger 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea (n = 9). Angioplasty-induced injury was similar among groups. After angioplasty, control dogs exhibited localized and persistent vessel constriction, which was maximal at the initial 5 minutes (28.9 +/- 6.3% diameter decrease versus baseline). Corresponding arterial diameters of SOD-treated dogs were 24-69% larger (95% confidence interval, p less than 0.001) than controls at 5 minutes and, on average, 32% larger than controls thereafter (p less than 0.01). Vasoconstriction was not prevented by the other treatments. The SOD dose used accounted for inhibition of zymosan-stimulated blood cytochrome c reduction versus baseline (7 +/- 3 versus 30 +/- 6 nmol/min/10(6) cells, respectively, p = 0.003); such inhibition occurred in no other group. Prevalence of mural thrombosis was similar among all groups, but large thrombi (greater than 15% of lumen area) were absent in SOD-treated dogs, contrary to control group (p = 0.028); other groups were similar to control. In the absence of injury, SOD alone induced no change in coronary diameter, coronary blood flow, or platelet aggregation. CONCLUSIONS. These data provide evidence implicating the superoxide radical in the genesis of vasoconstriction after coronary angioplasty in vivo. Such effects seem to be independent of its conversion to hydroxyl radicals and availability of hydrogen peroxide or catalytic iron complexes. \nValproate in the treatment of persistent chronic daily headache. An open label study. Thirty patients with persistent chronic daily headache, unresponsive to various combinations of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment were selected for an open label study using divalproex sodium. All patients had normal liver function tests. After a baseline observation period of 1 month, patients were given divalproex sodium 1000 to 2000 mg per day, for a period of 3 months. Blood valproic acid levels were kept between 75 and 100 mcg/ml. Liver function studies and blood ammonia levels were obtained periodically. Based on weekly headache index, headache-free days, dysfunctional days and patients' general well-being rating and physicians' global assessment, two thirds of the patients improved significantly. The common side effects included weight gain, tremor, hair loss and nausea. Liver functions were unaffected by treatment. The possible mechanism of action of valproate in headache is discussed. Valproate appears to be a worthwhile addition to the prophylactic treatment of chronic recurrent headache. \nSequential administration of recombinant human interleukin-2 and dacarbazine in metastatic melanoma: a multicenter phase II study. Twenty-five assessable patients with metastatic melanoma have been entered in a multicenter phase II study of two induction cycles of human recombinant interleukin-2(IL2), 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d continuous intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 to 5 and days 12 to 17. Dacarbazine (DTIC), 850 mg/m2 IV bolus was given on day 26. The cycle was repeated at 5 weeks. Maintenance therapy was scheduled 3 weeks after the completion of induction treatment, consisting of IL2, 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d for 5 days alternating with DTIC, 850 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks, for a total of 18 weeks. Six patients responded (24%); two complete and four partial. Stable disease was seen in five patients. None of the six patients with more than two sites of metastases responded. Maximum response was observed in the first 3 months of treatment. Progression-free periods of 6 months and longer were seen in the two complete responders (8 and 17+ months), in two of the four partial responders (7 and 12+ months), and in three of the five patients with stable disease (9+, 15, and 17+ months). Toxicity included fever, skin rash, fatigue, anorexia, and diarrhea in most patients. Two patients had a weight gain of more than 10%. Eight patients needed intensive care for the observation and treatment of a myocardial injury (one patient), ventricular tachycardia (one), hypotension and oliguria (four), and sepsis (two). Sequential treatment with IL2 and DTIC appears to be effective but not clearly better than could be expected of IL2 alone. \nTotal parenteral nutrition-induced steatosis: reversal by parenteral lipid infusion. Prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be associated with hepatic complications, primarily steatosis and cholestasis. A case is reported of an 18-year-old woman with chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndrome who was on prolonged home parenteral nutrition without lipid supplementation and developed steatosis. This finding was reversed by addition of lipid emulsion, at a dose of 0.5 g/kg/day, to the parenteral nutrition solution. The lack of lipid supplementation as a possible cause of steatosis, as well as other mechanisms of liver steatosis associated with TPN, are discussed. \nCase-control study of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in children in Caithness near the Dounreay nuclear installation [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Apr 6;302(6780):818] OBJECTIVE--To examine whether the observed excess of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the area around the Dounreay nuclear installation is associated with established risk factors, or with factors related to the plant, or with parental occupation in the nuclear industry. DESIGN--Case-control study. SETTING--Caithness local government district. SUBJECTS--14 cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurring in children aged under 15 years diagnosed in the area between 1970 and 1986 and 55 controls matched for sex, date of birth, and area of residence within Caithness at time of birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Antenatal abdominal x ray examination; drugs taken and viral infections during pregnancy; father's occupation; father's employment at Dounreay and radiation dose; distance of usual residence from the path of microwave beams, preconceptional exposure to non-ionising radiation in the father; and other lifestyle factors. RESULTS--No raised relative risks were found for prenatal exposure to x rays, social class of parents, employment at Dounreay before conception or diagnosis, father's dose of ionising radiation before conception, or child's residence within 50 m of the path of microwave transmission beams. Results also proved negative for all lifestyle factors except an apparent association with use of beaches within 25 km of Dounreay. However, this result was based on small numbers, arose in the context of multiple hypothesis testing, and is certainly vulnerable to possible systematic bias. CONCLUSION--The raised incidence of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma around Dounreay cannot be explained by paternal occupation at Dounreay or by paternal exposure to external ionising radiation before conception. The observation of an apparent association between the use of beaches around Dounreay and the development of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma might be an artefact of multiple testing and influenced by recall bias. \nUse of i.v. radionuclide total body arteriography to evaluate arterial bypass shunts--a new method--a review of several cases. Currently, Doppler ultrasound and contrast angiography are the main imaging procedures being used to evaluate arterial bypass shunts. IV radionuclide total body arteriography (TBA) is another useful imaging procedure for evaluation of bypass shunts. The authors reviewed 33 patients, 19 women and 14 men, ranging in age from forty-three to eighty-five, who had TBA done after arterial bypass surgery. Ten patients had multiple shunts and 5 had multiple follow-up studies. In total there were 80 shunts, including 43 femoropopliteal, 16 axillofemoral, 1 axillopopliteal, 13 crossover femorofemoral, and 7 aortofemoral shunts. Sixty-two of the 80 shunts were patent, 14 were occluded, and 4 had partial occlusion. The results were confirmed by Doppler studies, contrast angiograms, and/or surgical exploration without false positives or false negatives. Since the radiotracer used was 99mTc-labeled red blood cells, a MUGA study can also be performed immediately following TBA in the same injection. Twenty-eight patients had gated cardiac blood pool studies (MUGA) done; 16 had abnormal wall motion and diminished ventricular function. TBA requires only a single IV injection of radiotracer (less than 1 cc) in the upper limb. The imaging times for total body arterial and perfusion images are seventy seconds and five minutes respectively. Both total body arterial and perfusion images clearly demonstrated the entire course of shunts (single or multiple); underlying and coexisting arterial abnormalities, e g, occlusive disease (27 patients), or aneurysm (3 patients); and related perfusion changes in the extremities. TBA has unique features. It permits a complete, excellent visualization of the bypass graft without the hazard of contrast media injection. It is a simple and a virtually noninvasive procedure, particularly useful for preoperative workups and postoperative follow-ups. \nTemporarily implanted urethral coil stent for the treatment of recurrent urethral strictures: a preliminary report. A new urethral stent developed for use in recurrent urethral strictures is presented. This metallic coil is self-expanding when released from its introducing catheter. The stent was used in 18 patients with recurrent strictures necessitating frequent dilation or urethrotomy. The stent is introduced under fluoroscopic guidance after internal urethrotomy or simple dilation. Strictures of 5 to 60 mm. were treated successfully with this device. All strictures were distal to the external sphincter. No serious complications attributed to the device were recorded. When necessary, the stent could be repositioned either under fluoroscopic control or endoscopically. This device can hold the stenotic area of the urethra open for long intervals allowing for complete healing. Even after 6 months the stent is not covered with urethral epithelium and does not become incorporated into the urethral wall. It can be removed easily without an operation by simple manipulation. The large internal caliber permits passage of endoscopes up to 17F in patients who require cystoscopy. The device can be removed before transurethral resections and then a new stent can be inserted at the end of the procedure. Mean followup of our patients with the stent indwelling was 8 months (range 4 to 11 months). Followup after removal of the stent (6 patients) was 3 to 8 months (mean 5 months). The patients voided well during followup and were fully continent. No incrustations were noted in the removed stents even after 6 months and no stent became obstructed due to tissue proliferation or incrustation. In 1 patient the stricture recurred after 3 months and a new stent was inserted. Urine sterilization was obtained in 7 patients with infected urine after relatively short courses of antibiotics. This stent seems to be a promising tool for the nonoperative treatment of recurrent urethral strictures. \nMother and child. Trauma in pregnancy. The role of the emergency physician in optimizing outcome for the maternal and fetal victims of trauma is pivotal. Knowledge of the anatomic and physiologic changes of pregnancy aid in understanding the nuances of care of the pregnant trauma patient. Both catastrophic and noncatastrophic trauma can be managed with confidence and expertise by recalling the maternal and fetal pathophysiologic responses to trauma. Burns and electrical injuries carry significant fetal risks, which may be minimized by rapid and knowledgeable emergency care. \nCilioretinal artery occlusion in young adults with central retinal vein occlusion. Ten patients, all younger than 50 years of age, had a temporal cilioretinal artery occlusion associated with a nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion. On fluorescein angiography, the cilioretinal artery eventually filled in all but one eye. The cilioretinal artery showed pulsations on fluorescein angiography in five eyes. The central retinal vein occlusion eventually resolved and the fundus assumed a normal appearance in all nine of the followed cases. Eight of nine eyes that underwent follow-up examination had final visual acuity of 20/30 or better. The occlusion of the central retinal vein produces an elevation of intraluminal capillary pressure because the central retinal artery continues to pump blood into the retina. Because the perfusion pressure of the cilioretinal artery is lower than the central retinal artery, it becomes relatively occluded. The prognosis for these patients is generally good unless the entire parafoveal capillary net is affected by the cilioretinal artery that is occluded. \nPerilymphatic fistula: analysis of free amino acids in middle ear microaspirates. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine 19 free amino acid concentrations in perilymph, serum/plasma, and red blood cell intracellular fluid. Significant differences were found between perilymph and these fluids. Free amino acid analysis was then used to quantitatively analyze middle ear microaspirates in order to test the hypothesis that perilymph is a potential source of clear fluid in perilymphatic fistulas (PLF). Fourteen unknown samples from patients with visually identified PLF, including patients with no identifiable otic capsule defect, were studied. Six samples on amino acid pattern analysis were correlated most similarly with perilymph (rrho greater than 0.95). Four of these six samples were scored on the basis of quantitative amino acid values as similar to perilymph. However, three samples of clear fluid were more similar to serum/plasma than to perilymph on both amino acid pattern and quantitative amino acid score analysis. These results objectively suggest perilymph as a potential source of clear fluid in some patients with a diagnosis of PLF. Not all clear fluid observed in the middle ear, however, is potentially perilymph. \nPredictors of clinical response in hirsute women treated with spironolactone. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical efficacy of low dose spironolactone in hirsute women. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Outpatient endocrinology clinic. PATIENTS: One hundred nine consecutive women prescribed 75 to 100 mg/d spironolactone for at least 4 months in whom adequate follow-up data were available. RESULTS: Hirsutism improved in 72% of the women. Women with regular menses, whether or not they used oral contraceptives (OCs), had the highest response rate to spironolactone (78%), whereas women with irregular menses who did not use an OC had the lowest response rate (55%). Favorable responses were associated with increased severity of hirsutism (P = 0.04) and lower serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (P = 0.05). Responders and nonresponders did not differ significantly in age (P = 0.10), duration of hirsutism (P = 0.14), pretreatment serum testosterone (T) (P = 0.48), or body mass index (P = 0.11). However, when each parameter was divided into subsets, trends toward decreasing response were observed with increasing age, duration of hirsutism over 15 years, and increasing serum T level. CONCLUSION: Low-dose spironolactone improves hirsutism in a majority of hirsute women, irrespective of age, severity or duration of hirsutism, menstrual status, or serum hormone levels. \nQuantitative analysis of basal dendrites of prefrontal pyramidal cells after chronic alcohol consumption and withdrawal in the adult rat. The effects of chronic alcohol consumption and withdrawal on the organization of the basal dendrites of layer III pyramidal cells of the prelimbic cortex were studied in groups of rats fed on alcohol for 6 or 18 months, and in a group fed for 12 months, then switched to water for a further 6 months (withdrawal group). Three-dimensional analysis of the dendritic arborizations showed an age-dependent increase in several dendritic parameters, but a net stability was found in the metrical parameters between alcohol-fed and respective control rats. Conversely, a dendritic impoverishment occurred in the withdrawal group. The linear density of dendritic spines remained stable in all groups studied. Together with the previously found marked loss of the neurons after alcohol consumption and withdrawal, these findings point to a decrease in the available targets for afferents and therefore to the presence of probable functional alterations as a consequence of those in the connectivity patterns of the prelimbic area occurring under these conditions. \nEndometriosis in episiotomy scar with anal sphincter involvement. Report of a case. A case of endometriosis in an episiotomy scar with involvement of the external anal sphincter is presented. The clinical, operative, and pathologic findings are reported. The question of etiology and treatment is discussed, and the literature is reviewed. Wide excision of the ectopic endometrial tissue with primary reconstruction of the external sphincter was curative, and the functional result was excellent. It is suggested that this treatment policy should be recommended for these cases. \nAortic dissection resulting from tear of transverse arch: is concomitant arch repair warranted? Forty-seven patients with aortic dissection resulting from a primary tear located in the transverse aortic arch underwent surgical treatment. Twenty-six patients had acute type A, 7 had acute type B, 7 had chronic type A, and 7 had chronic type B aortic dissections. Of the 33 patients with acute dissections, 11 (7 acute type A and 4 acute type B) underwent concomitant arch repair with an operative (less than or equal to 30 days) mortality rate of 55% (35% to 73%, +/- 1 asymmetric 70% confidence limit) (2 of 7 acute type A and 4 of 4 acute type B). Concomitant arch repair was omitted in 22 patients with acute dissections (19 acute type A and 3 acute type B); the operative mortality rate was 41% (29% to 54%) (7 of 19 acute type A and 2 of 3 acute type B) (p = not significant versus arch repair). The overall survival rate for those with arch repair was 45% +/- 15% (+/- 1 standard error of the estimate) at 4 years, compared with 43% +/- 11% for patients without arch repair (p = not significant). Considering the type of dissection, the 4-year survival estimate for patients with acute type A dissections who underwent arch repair (5 hemiarch and 2 total arch) was 71% +/- 17% (versus 44% +/- 12% for acute type A patients without arch repair). There were no survivors among the 4 patients with acute type B dissections who had an arch repair (1 hemiarch and 3 total arch), whereas patients with acute type B dissections who did not undergo concomitant arch repair had a 4-year survival estimate of 33% +/- 27% (p = not significant versus arch repair). Four other patients with acute type B dissections resulting from an arch tear were managed medically and tended to have a slightly better prognosis (2-year survival estimate of 75% +/- 22% versus 14% +/- 13% for all surgically treated acute type B patients), but again this difference was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis of the 47 surgical patients revealed that advanced age (p = 0.0008), preoperative dissection complications (p = 0.02), and other coexistent medical problems (p = 0.03) were the only significant, independent determinants of overall mortality. Initial arch repair was not a significant predictor. Nine percent (2/22) of patients with acute type A dissections who initially underwent isolated ascending aortic replacement required subsequent arch replacement; 1 died after reoperation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nThe eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome: the Los Alamos Conference. On June 12 and 13, 1990 the Los Alamos National Laboratory in cooperation with the New Mexico Department of Health and Environment, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) hosted a conference on the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Fifty presentations covered a variety of important issues which are summarized herein. \nInterleukin-7 differentiates a subgroup of acute lymphoblastic leukemias. The bone marrow stromal cell-derived growth factor interleukin-7 (IL-7) is known to stimulate growth of normal human B-cell precursors. In the present report, we have examined the effect of IL-7 on neoplastic B-cell precursors. Leukemic cells from 20 patients with common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were highly purified by removing contaminating T cells and monocytes by rosetting with immunomagnetic beads. IL-7 markedly reduced the DNA synthesis in leukemic cells from three patients. This inhibition of DNA synthesis was accompanied by maturation of the cells, as demonstrated by the induced expression of the differentiation antigens CD19, CD20, CDw75, and surface mu-chain, and a decreased expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. By examining G1 parameters, such as MYC, 4F2, and transferrin-receptor levels analyzed by flow cytometry as well as RNA and the cell cycle regulated antigen Ki67, it appeared that the cells were inhibited late in G1. Leukemic cells from the majority of the cases (12 of the 20 patients) responded to IL-7 with enhanced DNA synthesis without detectable maturation, as has been reported for their normal counterparts. Low molecular weight B-cell growth factor greatly potentiated the IL-7-induced growth stimulation of these cells. Thus, we have shown that IL-7 is capable of inhibiting proliferation of leukemic cells isolated from a subgroup of ALLs, and that this growth inhibition is accompanied by maturation of the cells. \nMagnesium inhibits the hypertensive but not the cardiotonic actions of low-dose epinephrine. Intravenous magnesium supplementation is often used to control cardiac arrhythmias and coronary artery vasospasm resulting from disturbances of magnesium homeostasis after coronary artery bypass surgery. Many such patients also require inotropic drug support of depressed myocardial function. However, increased serum magnesium concentrations directly depress cardiac contractility in animals and may interfere with catecholamine actions. To determine whether small intravenous doses of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) interfere with the cardiotonic actions of epinephrine, we examined the hemodynamic effects of MgSO4 and epinephrine infusion in 17 cardiac surgical patients on their 1st postoperative day in a prospective, controlled study. In 11 patients, infusion of MgSO4 (7-mg.kg-1 bolus followed by 10 mg.kg-1.h-1 as a continuous infusion) increased serum magnesium concentrations by 44% (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM] of 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 mM; P less than 0.01) but had no significant effect on heart rate; mean arterial, central venous, or pulmonary arterial occlusion pressures; or cardiac output. Epinephrine infusion (30 ng.kg-1.min-1) significantly increased cardiac index (2.7 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.21.min-1.m-2; P less than 0.05); this effect was not altered by MgSO4 administration (n = 11). However, MgSO4 significantly blunted epinephrine's hypertensive action and prevented a significant increase in mean arterial pressure during concurrent MgSO4-epinephrine administration. Six placebo control patients were given two sequential infusions of epinephrine separated by a placebo infusion to rule out an effect of time on the hemodynamic response to epinephrine. Mean arterial pressure and cardiac index responses to epinephrine were identical before and after placebo infusion. \nDiagnostic importance of the radiographic density of noncalcified breast masses: analysis of 91 lesions. Radiographic density is considered an important feature in the evaluation of noncalcified breast masses, yet no studies assessing its value have been published. The radiographic densities of 91 biopsy-proved, nonfatty, noncalcified breast masses were evaluated by three mammographers. The density determinations made by each observer were compared with the histologic outcome for the 51 benign and 40 malignant lesions. With the kappa statistic, interobserver agreement was relatively poor (0.22 to 0.49), and intraobserver agreement for one expert mammographer was 0.50. When the majority opinion of the mammographers was used, sensitivity was 48%, specificity was 80%, and both positive and negative predictive values were 66%. As a solitary feature in lesion analysis, mammographic density is difficult to assess and is of limited value for the prediction of the benign or malignant nature of noncalcified breast masses. \nRetrograde suction decompression of an ophthalmic artery aneurysm using balloon occlusion. Technical note. A large ophthalmic artery aneurysm was ligated using a modification of the retrograde suction technique described by Batjer and Samson. Temporary proximal occlusion of the internal carotid artery was accomplished with a double-lumen balloon catheter, and distal occlusion was performed with a temporary clip. The aneurysm was collapsed by gentle aspiration through the distal lumen of the balloon catheter. This greatly facilitated dissection and clip ligation of the aneurysm. \nPatterns in visual interpretation of coronary arteriograms as detected by quantitative coronary arteriography. In part 1 of a three-part study, 14 novice readers and 6 experienced cardiologists interpreted phantom images of known stenosis severity. No difference between the interpretations of experienced and novice readers was detectable. Visual estimates of \"moderately\" severe stenosis were 30% higher than actual percent diameter stenosis. In part 2 of the study, visual interpretation of percent diameter stenosis from 212 stenoses on 241 arteriograms was compared with quantitative coronary arteriographic assessment. The visual analysis overestimated disease severity in arteries with greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis (except for right coronary lesions) and underestimated severity in all arteries with less than 50% diameter stenosis. Of the 241 arteriograms, 40 had quantitative and visual analysis of all three coronary arteries for assessment of significant disease. In only 62% of the cases did visual and quantitative methods agree on the presence of severe disease; visual estimates diagnosed significantly (p less than 0.05) more three-vessel disease. In part 3 of the study, comparison of percent diameter stenosis by visual estimate with quantitative coronary arteriographic assessment before and after balloon angioplasty of 38 stenoses showed that visual interpretation significantly (p less than 0.001) overestimated initial lesion severity and underestimated stenosis severity after angioplasty. \nHeadache syndromes as detected by configural frequency analysis. Data on headache symptoms obtained in two samples (N = 422 and 304) by means of questionnaires were subjected to configural frequency analysis (CFA). This not widely-known method tests whether certain symptom combinations appear more often or less often than expected by chance. In both samples symptom combinations corresponding to the syndromes of migraine with aura, migraine without aura and tension headache did indeed occur with significant frequency. The same clear-cut symptom patterns appeared when patients with preceding visual disturbances were excluded from analysis. These results seem to lend strong support to a categorical model of headache, rather than to the concept of headache as a spectrum. \nPhenytoin-induced hemocytophagic histiocytosis indistinguishable from malignant histiocytosis. We have reported a case of phenytoin-induced hemocytophagic histiocytosis indistinguishable on clinical and histopathologic grounds from malignant histiocytosis. We emphasize the need to investigate for microbiologic causes and drug ingestion, even if the diagnosis of malignant histiocytosis is plausible. We think that reactive and malignant histiocytosis are not really two distinct entities with different etiologies, but a continuum of host responses to several insults with different degrees of aggressiveness depending on the host immune status. \nRadiologic findings of clonorchiasis. Clonorchiasis is a trematodiasis caused by chronic infestation of liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis. The adult flukes reside in the medium-sized and small intrahepatic bile ducts and, occasionally, in the extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreatic duct. The result is mechanical obstruction, inflammatory reaction, adenomatous hyperplasia, and periductal fibrosis. Signs and symptoms are usually mild and nonspecific, but heavy infestation results in obstructive jaundice. The disease has a close relationship with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma. In this article, the radiologic findings, including cholangiography, sonography, and CT of clonorchiasis are reviewed in light of the pathophysiology of the disease. The relationship to recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and to cholangiocarcinoma is discussed. \nAn immunoinhibitory cell wall glycoprotein (mannan) from Trichophyton rubrum. Trichophyton rubrum causes 90% of chronic dermatophyte infections. Most patients with widespread chronic T. rubrum infection fail to express a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to intradermally injected trichophytin. We propose that cell-mediated immunity to T. rubrum may be suppressed in chronic infections by the mannan cell wall component of the fungus. The proposed suppressive effect of T. rubrum mannan on cell-mediated immunity was tested by measuring the ability of extracted mannan to inhibit lymphoproliferative responses of human mononuclear leukocytes to antigens, mitogens, and an anti-T-cell receptor antibody (anti-CD3) in vitro. Mannan was found to be highly antigenic in two of five donors and weakly antigenic in the other three. Despite its antigenic property, mannan exhibited a dose-related ability to inhibit lymphoproliferation stimulated by other agents including 1) antigens from Candida albicans, T. rubrum, and tetanus toxoid (ID50 = 250 micrograms/ml); 2) anti-CD3 antibody (ID50 = 250 micrograms/ml); and 3) Phaseolus limensis mitogenic lectin (ID50 = 64 micrograms/ml). Mannan added to cultures later than 24 h after initiation had no inhibitory influence, but culture of cells with mannan for a period of 24 h prior to the addition of stimulus enhanced the inhibitory effect of the glycoprotein. Lymphoproliferation in response to recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) was not inhibited. The influence of time of addition of mannan and the failure of mannan to inhibit IL-2-stimulated lymphoproliferation demonstrate that the suppressive effect of mannan must be pharmacologic rather than cytotoxic. The observed ability of T. rubrum cell wall mannan to suppress cell-mediated immune function in vitro may provide an important clue to a mechanism enabling the fungus to avoid elimination in chronically infected patients. \nPolycystic kidneys, pancreatic cysts, and cystadenomatous bile ducts in the oral-facial-digital syndrome type I. Oral-facial-digital syndrome type I is a group of X-linked dominant conditions, lethal in utero in male individuals. Internal anomalies are less well documented than are external findings. We report a case of typical phenotype and absent family history of kidney disease in a 15-year-old white girl (46,XX) who died of renal failure and massive cerebral hemorrhage. At necropsy, the kidneys were greatly enlarged but of fairly normal shape. The cortex was replaced by thin-walled spherical cysts, 0.5 to 2.0 cm in diameter; the majority of the smaller cysts were located deep in the cortex, and the medulla contained lesser numbers of larger cysts. No distal urinary tract obstruction was present. Microdissection revealed cysts and diverticula located in all segments of the nephrons and collecting ducts. Uninvolved nephrons showed diffuse hypertrophy. These findings were correlated with immunoperoxidase stains using peanut lectin, Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin, antibodies to cytokeratins, stage-specific embryonic antigen-1, Tamm-Horsfall protein, and epithelial membrane antigen. Other visceral anomalies included biliary cystadenomatous proliferation in the liver and pancreatic cysts. The renal changes are similar to those of autosomal dominant (adult-type) polycystic disease. \nEffect of the tibial cut on subsidence following total knee arthroplasty. In 33 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) using instrumentation designed to cut the tibia with 0 degree posterior slope, ten tibial components demonstrated at least 2 mm of tibial component subsidence. These subsided components were implanted onto tibiae with an average of 8 degrees +/- 2 degrees difference between the preoperative, anatomic posterior slope and their postoperative posterior slope. The remaining 23 components, without subsidence, were implanted onto tibiae cut within 2 degrees +/- 2 degrees of their anatomic slope. To help understand these clinical observations, a laboratory study was performed to compare the load carrying capacity and the stiffness of tibial subchondral bone following two types of tibial cuts: one made perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia and the other made parallel to the articular surface of the tibia. Mock tibial baseplates mounted on paired cadaver tibiae were loaded in compression and force displacement curves were recorded. Tibiae cut parallel to the surface exhibited 40% greater load carrying capacity and 70% greater stiffness than the paired tibiae cut perpendicular to the long axis. The biomechanical data of this study indicated that cutting the tibia perpendicular to the long axis results in weaker bone that may be inadequate to support a tibial component. This may explain the higher incidence of clinical subsidence if the tibial cut is not made approximately parallel to the anatomic slope. \nFinapres: a noninvasive device to monitor blood pressure. Often, obstetric patients are not evaluated in preliminary studies during the development of new medical devices. The purpose of this study was to compare the Finapres digital probe with oscillometric and arterial line devices for recording blood pressures in low- and high-risk pregnant women. A total of 38 women were studied, including 24 with pregnancy-induced hypertension, two with chronic hypertension, two with cardiac disease, and ten who had no risk factors but requested epidural catheter placement. The comparison of Finapres or oscillometric recordings with direct arterial values confirmed that systolic recordings were imprecise for both devices (r = 0.80 and r = 0.64, respectively). Diastolic recordings (Korotkoff sound, phase 4) from the Finapres were accurate compared with the arterial values (r = 0.84). The Finapres performed at least as reliably as the oscillometric monitor in assessing blood pressure in our pregnant population and provided continuous measurements. When very accurate systolic recordings are needed, arterial catheter placement may be necessary. \nSome perspectives on peptic ulcer. In this article, the author comments on the following topics: whether peptic ulcer is a disease or just the sign of another process; whether the crater has a multifactorial origin; the ubiquity of Helicobacter pylori and the conclusion that a specific strain will doubtless prove to be the cause of some, but not all, ulcers; the inherent definitional problem of \"nonulcer dyspepsia\"; and the controversy over how much gastric acid needs to be reduced to speed the healing of peptic ulcer. \nHepatocyte proliferation in stepwise development of experimental liver cell cancer. Cell proliferation is the most central and key phenotypic property of cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocyte proliferation is central not only at the late steps in carcinogenesis, the cancer, but at the earliest known step, initiation. Compensatory or regenerative hepatocyte proliferation is essential to initiation with chemical carcinogens but primary hyperplasia is ineffective. During promotion, hepatocyte proliferation is the major change seen as clonal proliferation to generate nodules occurs. During progression, autonomous hepatocyte proliferation balanced by cell loss makes its appearance. This continues in a balanced fashion with only a slight excess of proliferation over loss until the earlier steps in malignancy at which time the balance is disrupted. \nSplenosis: an unusual cause of intraabdominal hemorrhage. A 31-year-old female presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe abdominal pain. She developed hypovolemic shock from an intra-abdominal bleed. At laparotomy she was found to be bleeding from two areas of splenosis on the uterine ligament. The patient had sustained a ruptured spleen 22 years prior and had no symptomatology from her areas of splenosis. A short review of splenosis is presented. \nStreptokinase and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) are equally effective in treating acute myocardial infarction. In recent trials, patients with myocardial infarction who received either recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or streptokinase showed essentially no difference in the amount of myocardial salvage, in mortality reduction, or in the incidence of bleeding complications. These findings thus failed to fulfill the expectation that rt-PA would be twice as effective as streptokinase as a thrombolytic agent. The basis for this mistaken prediction was an unfortunate overemphasis on an inadequate surrogate endpoint, namely, the patency or reperfusion rate at 90 minutes after the start of therapy. Using the 90-minute patency or reperfusion rate as an endpoint has several serious limitations. First, it is an observation made at only one point in time during a dynamic process that may change even during the infusion proper. Second, a single view at 90 minutes completely disregards the possibility of subsequent reocclusion which often occurs within 1 hour after treatment. Third, an image at 90 minutes is more a reflection of the speed of thrombolysis than of whether lysis will eventually occur; the pace of clot lysis depends on both the agent used and the age of the thrombus. Fourth, lysis at 90 minutes is of minimal relevance for myocardial salvage unless observed within the time frame when infarction size can be limited significantly, which is generally less than 4 hours between symptom onset and the time that reperfusion is accomplished. Fifth, a stable state of vessel patency is meaningful for mortality reduction even if stabilization occurs after completion of the infarction. Such \"late,\" but lasting, patency is a critical component of the \"open vessel\" principle and explains, at least in part, the survival benefit that accrues to patients treated even 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. There is currently no evidence that rt-PA has a more beneficial effect on survival or function than does streptokinase or any other plasminogen activator used in treating acute myocardial infarction; nor is there any evidence that patients who receive rt-PA therapy show a decreased incidence of bleeding complications compared with those who receive streptokinase, despite the relative fibrinogen-sparing attribute of rt-PA. Given the poor predictive value of the 90-minute angiogram for ultimate clinical advantage of one agent over another, studies that are limited to this endpoint are of marginal use in evaluating treatment regimens used in mortality studies. The best evidence to date indicates that streptokinase and rt-PA are of equivalent value for survival after acute myocardial infarction, a conclusion that can be justifiably challenged only with a valid mortality study. \nSuccessful transcatheter embolization of pseudoaneurysm associated with pancreatic pseudocyst. Hemorrhage into a pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare event, but is the most rapidly lethal complication of chronic pancreatitis. Visceral-vessel aneurysms are an unexpectedly common finding in arteriography of patients with chronic pancreatitis. This case report describes bleeding from an anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm, caused by chronic pancreatitis. The aneurysm was successfully treated by embolization with a steel coil. \nConcealed rhythms by double ventricular parasystole. Electrocardiograms taken from 11 patients in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopic rhythms from two different foci were analyzed to find the number of sinus beats, S, between the ectopic rhythms (S values). Three out of 11 patients had the S values typical for concealed ectopic rhythms. One of them had concealed bigeminy of 2n-1 form that occasionally shifted to 2n form. Following the shift, S values of 2n-1 form were always achieved by the occurrence of double ventricular ectopic rhythms in succession. Concealed trigeminy of 3n and 3n-2 form was seen in the other two patients. Double ventricular ectopic rhythms had bizarre abnormal QRS complexes of two different morphologies and were inscribed in opposite directions. Ectopic rhythms in each case had parasystolic characteristics. These observations suggest bifocal automaticity as a mechanism for bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. \nCerebral vasculopathy associated with collateralization resembling moya moya phenomenon and with anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies. We describe a 48-year-old, previously healthy, anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibody positive black woman with negative risk factors for atherosclerosis, who developed mental status and personality changes over a 6-12-month period, and progressive cortical blindness over a 2-week period. Angiographic and computed axial tomographic studies of the brain demonstrated multiple large areas of infarction correlating with stenosis and occlusions of the internal carotid and posterior cerebral arteries. Moya moya-like findings were prominent radiographically. Results of angiographic, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance imaging studies were interpreted as being compatible with large, medium, and small vessel disease, most likely a vasculitis. \nMyocardial and aerobic requirements for an upper body exerciser: implications for cardiac rehabilitation. To assess the cardiorespiratory, hemodynamic, and electrocardiograph (ECG) responses to an upper body exercise device, we studied ten cardiac men (mean age +/- SD = 58.0 +/- 6.5 years) who performed three five-minute exercise bouts at metronome settings of 20, 50, and 80 clicks per minute. Operation of the device involved shuttling a plastic buoy on two 6-m waxed ropes between two persons. Aerobic requirements were generally appropriate for arm training, corresponding to mean values of 5.3, 7.0, and 10.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 at the three progressive metronome settings. Perceived exertion (Borg, 6 to 20 scale) at these work rates was 8.3, 10.4, and 14.6, whereas average heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses were 77, 85, and 114 beats.min-1 and 145, 158, and 175 mmHg, respectively. Continuous ECG monitoring during upper body exercise revealed no significant ST-segment depression or serious arrhythmias. The device appears to be a safe and effective complement to a cardiac exercise training program. \nCarcinoma and DNA aneuploidy in Crohn's colitis--a histological and flow cytometric study. Twenty four patients with longstanding colonic Crohn's disease were examined prospectively with colonoscopy and multiple biopsy sampling in order to detect histological dysplasia or abnormal aneuploid DNA content, or both. Biopsy specimens were taken from 10 predetermined locations in the colon and rectum. No patient had definite dysplasia but three displayed DNA aneuploidy (12.5%), and one of these subsequently developed a carcinoma (Dukes' C at operation) in the ascending colon. No concomitant dysplasia was detected but the carcinoma as well as other parts of the mucosa were DNA aneuploid. It is concluded that dysplasia is rare in patients with Crohn's colitis, but findings of DNA aneuploidy warrant vigilance in follow up as this may indicate impending carcinoma. Further prospective studies are needed before the predictive value of DNA aneuploidy can be determined and before general recommendations of colonoscopic surveillance, as in longstanding ulcerative colitis, can be made. \nOcutome lensectomy: results and complications. We describe the results and the complications encountered in 69 lensectomies performed via a limbal approach with the Ocutome vitrectomy instrument, in which it was the intention at surgery to maintain the integrity of the posterior capsule. After operation 87% improved in visual acuity, and 68% achieved 6/12 or better. The main early complications encountered were perioperative rupture of the posterior capsule and iris damage. The main late complications were postoperative thickening of the posterior capsule, retinal detachment, and bullous keratopathy. Of the eyes in which the posterior capsule remained intact after operation 17% developed thickening of the posterior capsule to a degree that required capsulotomy over a mean follow-up period of 50 months. \nAvascular necrosis of bone in children undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Avascular necrosis of bone (AVNB) is reported in two children after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Preparation therapy for transplantation included cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. Corticosteroids, cyclosporine A, and methotrexate were used for graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis. The possible role of combination therapy in development of AVNB is discussed, but a direct relationship with single agents was not found. However, an early diagnosis is important to institute conservative treatment and prevent irreversible damage to affected joints. Magnetic resonance imaging was found to be more sensitive than plain radiography in early detection of AVNB. \nCerebral dural sinus thrombosis. Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis is an unusual syndrome in which a patient presents with a severe headache that may be associated with diverse neurologic and physical findings. The case of a 31-year-old woman with headache, vomiting, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and subsequent dense hemiplegia is presented. The patient was diagnosed as having a cerebral dural sinus thrombosis, but only after the diagnosis was missed initially. The syndrome may be difficult to detect because it can mimic several other entities. There are several known or suspected predisposing factors. The syndrome, diagnostic modalities, and therapeutic options are reviewed. \nIsradipine, a calcium antagonist, in the control of hypertension following coronary artery-bypass surgery. Arterial hypertension is common after coronary artery-bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and may lead to postoperative complications. Therefore, the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine were studied in 10 postoperative CABG patients who had a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 100 mm Hg. Isradipine, given as a continuous infusion, reduced MAP to the range of 85 +/- 5 mm Hg in all patients within 15 min. Systemic vascular resistance fell and cardiac output increased in all patients. A slight increase in heart rate was seen in some, but not all, patients. There were no adverse effects. In conclusion, isradipine appears to be a useful agent in the treatment of postoperative hypertension following CABG surgery. \nPulmonary vascular distensibility of arterial, middle, and venous regions in newborn lambs. The pulmonary circulation in the adult is characterized by being relatively distensible, but whether the newborn lung shares this feature is less certain. We perfused isolated lungs treated with indomethacin from lambs of four ages (less than 1, 2-4, 12-14, and 30-32 days) to determine the effects of increasing left atrial pressure on the pulmonary vascular pressures measured by vascular inflow and outflow occlusion. An index of pulmonary vascular distensibility was assessed by comparing the slope of the pulmonary vascular pressure at the upstream end of a region as a function of the pressure at the downstream end of the region. A vascular distensibility index (VDI) of 1 indicates a rigid nondistensible system, whereas a VDI less than 1 indicates some degree of distensibility. During normoxia, lungs from all age groups were relatively indistensible as determined by VDI for the total vasculature (VDItotal) as well as for the different regions based on occlusion pressures (VDIarterial, VDImiddle, and VDIvenous). There were significant effects of age on the VDItotal, with decreases in the normoxic values occurring over the first 12-14 days of age, indicating an increase in pulmonary vascular distensibility. Only the VDIvenous was similarly affected by increasing neonatal age. Hypoxia significantly reduced the VDItotal in these same age groups. In addition, hypoxia, which increased the pressure gradients of the arterial and middle regions, significantly increased the VDIarterial in the youngest and oldest age groups but significantly decreased the VDImiddle at all ages by approximately 50%. In summary, we observed age-related changes in the vascular distensibility of the pulmonary circulation, with the VDItotal decreasing with increasing postnatal age. \nCongenital malignant melanoma of the eye. Twenty-three cases of congenital malignant melanoma have previously been reported. Here the authors report the first case of a congenital malignant melanoma arising in the eye. A newborn girl had a large pigmented ocular tumor, hepatomegaly, and multiple pigmented skin and choroidal lesions. The histopathologic diagnosis was of a malignant melanoma with hepatic metastases. The skin and choroidal lesions were considered to be congenital melanocytic nevi. The most plausible pathogenetic link between these two conditions was that the malignancy had arisen as a second-hit mutation within a choroidal congenital melanocytic nevus. Despite widespread metastases the baby, treated by surgery and chemotherapy, survives in good health, aged 2 years, 10 months. \nAssociation of nm23-H1 allelic deletions with distant metastases in colorectal carcinoma. A prospective study analysed the prognostic value of nm23-H1 allelic deletions in colorectal cancer. Of 21 patients with no evidence of distant metastases at initial operation, 11 showed nm23-H1 allelic deletions (including 1 homozygous deletion); 10 had no nm23-H1 deletions. After median follow-up of 25 months, distant metastases had developed in 8 of 11 (73%) patients with nm23-H1 deletions but in only 2 of 10 (20%) without nm23-H1 deletions (p less than 0.03). Tests with probe YNZ 22.1, near p53, showed no significant association with distant metastases. nm23-H1 may be, or may be located near, a late-acting suppressor gene in colorectal carcinoma, in which deletions may have prognostic value. \nSuppression by traumatic brain injury of spontaneous hemodynamic recovery from hemorrhagic shock in rats. The effects of brain trauma on cardiovascular and endocrine responses to hemorrhage were investigated. Forty anesthetized rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups of 10 rats each: a control group (Group C): a group with induction of hemorrhage at 16.2 ml/kg/10 min (Group H); a group with fluid-percussion brain injury at a peak pressure of 1.7 atm and an impulse duration of 25 msec (Group T); and a group receiving hemorrhagic shock following brain trauma (Group TH). Group C and T rats showed no significant alterations in cardiovascular function. At the end of hemorrhage there were no significant differences between Groups TH and H in the nadirs of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) (mean values +/- standard error of the mean: 42 +/- 2 vs. 40 +/- 4 mm Hg) and stroke volume index (SVI) (0.61 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.10 ml/bt/kg); however, 1 hour post-hemorrhage recovery was blunted in Group TH compared to Group H (MABP 56 +/- 4 vs. 65 +/- 3 mm Hg; cardiac index 182 +/- 15 vs. 220 +/- 15 ml/min/kg; and SVI 0.71 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.06 ml/bt/kg). Since the two groups showed no significant differences in heart rate, preload (central venous pressure), and afterload (systemic vascular resistance), the reduced cardiac index recovery in Group TH is believed due to the attenuation of cardiac contractile performance. The Group TH preparation potentiated hormonal responses to hemorrhage with significantly higher epinephrine and aldosterone levels than in Group H. Brain trauma enhanced the norepinephrine response to hemorrhage, even at an injury level that by itself did not result in an increase in this hormone. Group TH rats also had significantly lower blood pH and HCO3 levels. The data suggest that brain trauma suppresses MABP and cardiac index recovery after hemorrhage mainly by inhibiting cardiac contractile performance, probably due to high catecholamine levels and severe metabolic acidosis. \nFine-needle aspiration biopsy of thyroid nodules. A cost-effective diagnostic plan. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a safe and accurate method for diagnosing thyroid nodules. Personnel who have experience with the aspiration technique and with the cytologic classification of specimens are crucial to accurate results. One important advantage of using fine-needle biopsy to initially screen patients with nodules is that it can save substantially on healthcare resources. \nReturn of interdigestive motor complex after abdominal surgery. End of postoperative ileus? Gastrointestinal mechanical activity was studied in 13 patients after different surgical procedures in a fasted and fed state and after pharmacological stimulation. Mechanical activity was recorded by means of a multi-pressure sensor probe placed intraoperatively into the jejunum. Abdominal surgery abolished normal motility only for a short period of time. The time for the reappearance of regular recurring activity fronts varied with the type of the surgical procedure from 3 hr after cholecystectomy to the sixth postoperative day after colon resection. The fed pattern occurred after the first postoperative interdigestive motor complex in all experiments. Stimulation was observed with ceruletide, which induced contractile activity in the small intestine during postoperative ileus. No coordinated caudad propagating activity was observed. The postoperative interdigestive motor complex did not correlate in time with the first passage of flatus and stool in our patients. Thus, the restoration of motility in the small intestine did not coincide with the clinical relief from the so-called \"physiological\" postoperative ileus. \nThe medial temporal lobe memory system. Studies of human amnesia and studies of an animal model of human amnesia in the monkey have identified the anatomical components of the brain system for memory in the medial temporal lobe and have illuminated its function. This neural system consists of the hippocampus and adjacent, anatomically related cortex, including entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. These structures, presumably by virtue of their widespread and reciprocal connections with neocortex, are essential for establishing long-term memory for facts and events (declarative memory). The medial temporal lobe memory system is needed to bind together the distributed storage sites in neocortex that represent a whole memory. However, the role of this system is only temporary. As time passes after learning, memory stored in neocortex gradually becomes independent of medial temporal lobe structures. \nDysfunction of the beta- and alpha-adrenergic systems in a model of congestive heart failure. The pacing-overdrive dog. The functional integrity of the beta- and alpha-adrenergic stimulatory pathways in a rapid ventricular pacing model of congestive heart failure in dogs was investigated; normal dogs served as controls. Total beta-adrenergic receptor density was 35% lower (p less than 0.01) in the pacing-overdrive dogs, and the beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase (Vmax) was found to be 68% and 72% lower (p less than 0.01) in the left and right ventricles of the paced dogs. In addition, the basal adenylate cyclase activity was found to be 56% and 68% lower (p less than 0.01) in the left and right ventricles of the failing heart. Similarly, the Vmax of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) and forskolin stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity was significantly lower, 70% and 55%, respectively (p less than 0.01), in both ventricles of the paced dogs. However, although the concentration yielding half-maximal velocity for beta-agonist and GppNHp stimulation of adenylate cyclase was similar in both groups, that for forskolin stimulation of the enzyme was significantly increased (p less than 0.01). Pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of membranes from control and failing hearts revealed a significant decrease in the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein content (48 +/- 9%, p less than 0.01) in the hearts of the paced dogs. Moreover, although the pertussis toxin treatment increased the basal and the forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in both normal and failing heart membranes, the adenylate cyclase activity remained significantly depressed in the failing heart after pertussis toxin treatment (p less than 0.01). Consistent with the depressed adenylate cyclase activity, mechanical studies on isolated papillary muscles and trabeculae revealed a decrease in baseline total tension (from 7.0 +/- 0.7 to 3.8 +/- 0.4 g/mm2, p less than 0.01) and dT/dt (from 26 +/- 8 to 13 +/- 1 g/mm2/sec, p less than 0.01) in the pacing-overdrive model. Tension generation and dT/dt observed in the paced dogs in response to increasing concentrations of forskolin demonstrated a rightward shift in the dose-response curve and a decrease in maximal forskolin stimulation (p less than 0.01). Similarly, maximal tension and dT/dt in the presence of isoproterenol was significantly lower than in the normal dogs (p less than 0.01). The decrease in beta-adrenergic responsiveness was accompanied by a decrease and rightward shift in alpha 1-adrenergic responsiveness (increase in tension was 1.1 +/- 0.1 g/mm2 in paced dogs versus 2.1 +/- 0.1 g/mm2 in controls, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nNo effect of zidovudine on hepatitis B virus replication in homosexual men with symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Zidovudine triphosphate inhibits the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase (DNAp) in vitro. Serial measurements of serum HBV DNAp activity and HBV DNA were made in 14 consecutive male homosexual patients starting zidovudine for symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Median duration of treatment was 15 weeks (range 2-72). In the 13 patients with detectable DNAp/DNA pre-treatment, no significant change in either measure of viral replication was observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment compared with the 13 weeks prior to treatment. The lack of response may be due to the opposing effect of immunosuppression, or to a failure of in vivo activity. \nGrowth prognosis and growth after menarche in primary hypothyroidism. The long term growth of 20 girls and nine boys with juvenile primary hypothyroidism was studied until they reached final height. At diagnosis the girls had a mean age of 8.8 years (range 3.0-13.0); mean bone age was 5.4 years. The mean age of the boys at diagnosis was 9.5 years (range 3.7-14.2); mean bone age was 6.3 years. The patients were treated with thyroxine 100 micrograms/m2/day and serum thyroxine concentrations were maintained in the normal range. During treatment the rate of skeletal maturation exceeded the change in chronological age. Initial mean height SD score for bone age before treatment in the girls was +0.59 and after 11 years of treatment fell to -0.55 Mean height SD score for bone age in the boys decreased from +1.6 to -0.87 during treatment. In the girls the onset of puberty was 1.2 years later than the normal population but the duration of puberty was reduced. Mean age (SD) of menarche was 13.8 (1.7) years. The pattern of growth in girls with treated hypothyroidism was abnormal as growth continued after menarche, at a time when normal girls have almost stopped growing. During the second year after menarche our patients still had a mean growth velocity of 4.1 cm/year. Our data suggest that juvenile primary hypothyroidism results in a permanent height deficit. In addition, there is a loss of the normal harmony between growth and sexual maturation in girls, despite adequate treatment, in that growth continues for much longer after menarche than in normal girls. \nIntraperitoneal hemorrhage from hepatocellular carcinoma: emergency chemoembolization or embolization. From 1982 to 1990, 38 patients with intraperitoneal hemorrhage from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) underwent treatment with emergency embolization with or without anticancer drug and iodized oil. Before emergency embolization, 24 patients had a serum total bilirubin value of 3.0 mg/dL or less (group A) and 14 patients had hyperbilirubinemia, with a serum bilirubin level greater than 3.0 mg/dL (group B). Successful hemostasis was achieved in all patients. The mean length of survival was 165 days in group A and 13 days in group B. A significant correlation (P less than .00003) between serum bilirubin level and prognosis was obtained. While tumor thrombus in the portal vein made the prognosis poor, there was no significant difference in prognosis between groups with and without tumor thrombus (P = .145). Emergency embolization is an effective treatment in patients with intraperitoneal hemorrhage from HCC. The prognosis for patients with HCC depends on the serum bilirubin level before embolization. \nRacial (black-white) differences in serum lipoprotein (a) distribution and its relation to parental myocardial infarction in children. Bogalusa Heart Study. BACKGROUND. The value of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] in the prediction of coronary artery disease risk very early in life remains to be established in different racial groups. METHODS AND RESULTS. Serum Lp(a) distribution and its relation to parental histories of myocardial infarction were examined in 2,438 children (8-17 years old) from a biracial community. Parental myocardial infarction was used as a surrogate measure of future risk of disease in the offspring. Lp(a) levels averaged 1.7-fold higher in blacks than in whites (p less than 0.0001). A small but significant sex difference (females greater than males, p less than 0.05) was seen in both races. Race was the only independent variable that contributed appreciably (9%) to the variability of Lp(a) in serum. White children with parental myocardial infarction (n = 90) had increased levels of Lp(a) compared with those without parental myocardial infarction (22.4 versus 17.1 mg/dl, p less than 0.01). Furthermore, among white children, the prevalence of parental myocardial infarction was higher in those with Lp(a) levels of more than 25 mg/dl than in those with values of 25 mg/dl or less (9.5% versus 5.4%, p less than 0.01). In contrast, the relation of Lp(a) to parental myocardial infarction was not seen in black children. No associations were observed between parental myocardial infarction and serum levels of any of the lipids or lipoprotein cholesterol classes in children of either race. CONCLUSIONS. Serum Lp(a) levels may prove valuable in the assessment of coronary artery disease risk early in life among white populations. These findings also emphasize the need to evaluate the atherogenic potential of Lp(a) in different racial groups. \nBrucella meningoencephalitis associated with cerebrospinal fluid shunt in a child: case report. Brucella meningoencephalitis is rare in young children. We describe a patient who developed Brucella meningoencephalitis at the age of 20 months while he had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in situ for treatment of hydrocephalus. This patient was treated with streptomycin and rifampicin. The shunt was left in situ, and all the clinical and laboratory test abnormalities subsided with this management. We propose that in a patient with Brucella meningoencephalitis, the cerebrospinal fluid shunt system can be left in situ and treatment with appropriate combination of antibiotics should prove to be successful. \nPosterior chamber IOL implantation with suboptimal posterior capsular support. A posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC/IOL) was implanted in 24 patients with suboptimal posterior capsular support due to preoperative or intraoperative rupture of the posterior capsule or zonules in which at least six clock hours of peripheral zonular support remained. The PC/IOLs were implanted, with ciliary sulcus haptic placement, with special attention to sulcus fixation of the haptics over the zone of residual zonular support. All of the IOLs have remained centered after a mean follow-up 10.5 months. We conclude that a PC/IOL can be successfully implanted and its position maintained if at least six clock hours of peripheral zonules remain. \nAnti-V region antibodies as \"almost clonotypic\" reagents for the study of cutaneous T cell lymphomas and leukemias. Despite recent advances in the understanding of normal T lymphocyte immunobiology, there has been little progress in characterizing the non-HTLV cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and leukemias (CTCL) Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary syndrome. The two major impediments to in vitro studies of these malignancies have been the contamination of CTCL cells with normal T cells and the inability to induce a vigorous proliferative response or establish long-term cultures with standard T-cell mitogens. The ideal reagent for identifying CTCL cells in a given patient would be tumor specific. Although a monoclonal antibody to the clonotypic antigen receptor on CTCL cells would approach this ideal, it is not currently feasible to generate such antibodies for each CTCL patient. As a compromise, we chose to test an \"almost clonotypic\" reagent by examining whether monoclonal antibodies directed at the variable (V) region of the T-cell antigen receptor could be applied to CTCL. We identified three Sezary patients, who by standard T-cell phenotype and Southern blot analysis for clonality had a virtually pure peripheral blood population of leukemic cells (PBL). We then screened the PBL of these patients with a panel of seven commercially available monoclonal anti-V region antibodies and found one patients' cells reacted greater than 99% with alpha V beta 5. The other patients' cells were non-reactive. In addition, we utilized a solid-phase system to cross-link V beta 5 on the one CTCL patients' PBL cells, and found that they proliferated vigorously in the presence of 10 units of IL-2 and IL-4. Parallel cultures have been maintained for one month by restimulation twice a week. These findings suggest that anti-V region antibodies should prove useful for investigating the immunobiology of CTCL. \nRoentgenographic dimensions of the upper airway in snoring patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a simple test, such as routine roentgenographic views of the upper airway, is useful in identifying anatomic narrowing of the airway in patients with sleep apnea. To accomplish this, we prospectively studied a group of 117 patients (95 male and 22 female subjects) referred for evaluation of heavy snoring and possible obstructive sleep apnea. All patients had full nocturnal polysomnography, including measurements of snoring. Lateral view of the airway obtained after swallowing contrast material was used to measure pharyngeal diameters at three sites along the airway. All measurements were performed with the patients standing and supine. We used three different definitions of sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index of 10, 20, and 40), and compared airway diameters between the apneic and nonapneic snorers. Only when sleep apnea was defined as greater than 40 apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep was there a significant difference in airway diameter at the tip of the palate and 1 cm distal to it between apneic and nonapneic snorers. Both groups of patients demonstrated a significant reduction in the retropalatal distance on assumption of the supine posture. Stepwise, forward, multiple linear regression analysis showed that the retropalatal distance and airway diameter at the tip of the palate and 1 cm distal to it were significant predictors of snoring, but not apnea. We conclude that (1) airway diameters account for some of the variability in snoring, and (2) they do not differentiate between apneic and nonapneic snorers. \nLiver function tests abnormalities in patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving artificial nutrition: a prospective randomized study of total enteral nutrition vs total parenteral nutrition. Liver and biliary abnormalities are well-known complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has been suggested that using total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may further impair liver function in these patients; this seems not to be so with total enteral nutrition (TEN). However, prospective trials comparing the incidence of liver function test (LFT) abnormalities with either TPN or TEN have not been carried out. Twenty-nine IBD inpatients with normal LFT, randomized to receive either TEN with a polymeric diet or isocaloric, isonitrogenous \"all-in-one\" TPN because of protein-energy malnutrition and/or severe disease, were included in the study. Sixteen patients (five with ulcerative colitis and 11 with Crohn's disease) received TEN, and 13 patients (eight ulcerative colitis and five Crohn's disease) were on TPN. All patients were on systemic steroids, and nine of them were on oral metronidazole. Both groups were homogeneous regarding age, sex, diagnosis, disease activity, nutritional status, daily nutrient supply, and days on artificial nutrition. Serum albumin levels significantly increased with TEN (32 +/- 1 to 38.2 +/- 1.6 g/liter, p less than 0.01), but not with TPN (32.1 +/- 2.2 to 33.9 +/- 1.4 g/liter, NS). Clinical improvement occurred in both groups of patients as shown by the change in the disease activity indexes. In all cases, measurements of serum alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase were performed weekly. There were no significant differences in the initial LFT between both groups. \nSuperoxide dismutase in psoriasis, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell epithelioma: an immunohistochemical study. Monoclonal antibodies against human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Mn-SOD were used to stain frozen sections of normal and abnormal human skin. In normal human epidermis, the Cu,Zn-SOD antibody almost exclusively stained the basal cells. Mn-SOD antibody weakly stained the whole of the epidermis but more predominantly the basal cell layer. In psoriasis, Cu,Zn-SOD antibody mainly stained the basal cells of the lowest parts of the elongated rete ridges. Basal cells corresponding to the tip of the dermal papillae were weakly stained. Mn-SOD staining was considerably decreased in the psoriatic epidermis. In squamous cell carcinoma, staining with both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD antibodies was decreased, and single cells positive for Cu,Zn-SOD were scattered throughout the tumour nests. In basal cell epithelioma, Cu,Zn-SOD staining was intense and diffusely distributed throughout the tumour nests, while Mn-SOD staining was absent. \nTime trends in incidence rates of acute, non-traumatic extremity ischaemia: a population-based study during a 19-year period. Time trends in the occurrence of acute limb ischaemia were studied from 1965 to 1983 in a defined geographical area in Sweden. Data were obtained from a computerized register which covers all instances of inpatient care for a population of 1.3 million. Analysis based on 5394 first admissions for acute arterial occlusion revealed that the annual number increased by 2.7 per cent yearly in women and 3.9 per cent in men whereas the age-adjusted incidence remained stable for women and increased by 2.6 per cent yearly for men. A study of 1189 patients who underwent surgical procedures showed that the annual number of embolectomy procedures increased 7.6 per cent for females and 8.6 per cent for males. The corresponding age-adjusted incidence rose annually by 3.0 per cent for women and by 7.5 per cent for men. The introduction of the Fogarty catheter and an increasing interest in vascular surgery may have contributed to the increasing rates of operations during the period of study. \nTrypanosoma cruzi: a carbohydrate epitope defined by a monoclonal antibody as a possible marker of the acute phase of human Chagas' disease. An IgM monoclonal antibody (MAb) against a carbohydrate epitope present in Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigote excretory-secretory antigens and expressed by different developmental stages of the parasite (epimastigote, trypomastigote and intracellular amastigote) was linked to a solid phase matrix and used as an antigen-capture antibody. Human serum complexes containing the epitope were then detected by using specific secondary antibodies against human immunoglobulin isotypes. Results of detection of IgM, IgG, and IgA serum complexes (SC) containing a T. cruzi polypeptide epitope showed that SC could be detected in 69% of the 13 Chagasic acute phase sera studied with IgG, in 84% with IgM, and in 75% with IgA. Only 16% (IgG-SC), 8% (IgM-SC), and 10% (IgA-SC) of chronic sera from 50 patients were positive. No patients with toxoplasmosis or rheumatoid factor were positive. Of the 11 leishmaniasis sera studied, four had IgG-SC, two had IgA-SC, and five had IgM-SC. Of the eight Yanomamo Indians infected by Onchocerca volvulus, three were found to have IgG-SC, two had IgM-SC, and two had IgA-SC. Thirteen sera from healthy individuals living in an endemic area were also studied. One subject had IgG IgM and IgA-SC. The results presented in this study show for the first time, the specific detection of IgM, IgG, and IgA immune complexes using a MAb against T. cruzi. The presence of the epitope in association with IgM antibodies in sera from patients with the acute phase of the disease suggests that this antigen(s) carrying the epitope that reacts with the MAb could be a marker(s) of active infection. In addition, the specificity of the serum complex capture assay allowed the detection of Chagas' disease in two different endemic areas (Argentina and Venezuela). \nPrimary tracheojejunal shunt operation for voice restoration following pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy. A primary tracheojejunal shunt operation was performed for voice restoration following pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy with free jejunum reconstruction for advanced hypopharyngeal cancer. A fistula was created between the membranous part of the trachea and the lower part of the transplanted jejunum. The membranous part of the trachea was tubed to construct the tracheojejunal shunt. All three patients who had the tracheojejunal shunt operation retained phonatory function. Pitch formation was seen in the voice waveform with use of the tracheojejunal shunt. No leakage was seen at all during deglutition and a swallowing function was obtained in all patients who had the tracheojejunal shunt. \nLate potentials are unaltered by ventricular filling pressure reduction in heart failure. Exacerbation of heart failure may increase susceptibility to arrhythmias. Therefore tests to assess the risk of arrhythmia, performed after hemodynamic improvement, may be of limited value. To determine whether hemodynamic improvement alters ventricular late potentials detected by signal-averaged ECG, we studied 27 consecutive patients with dilated heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 0.20 +/- 0.06, 15 with coronary artery disease) before and 3 +/- 2 days after tailored vasodilator and diuretic therapy reduced ventricular filling pressures. QRS duration, terminal QRS amplitude (root mean square [RMS]), and low-amplitude (less than 40 microV) signal (LAS) duration were determined by an automated algorithm from the vector magnitude of the QRS high-pass filtered at 25 Hz and at 40 Hz. Despite marked decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge (27 +/- 7 to 16 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and right atrial (13 +/- 7 to 7 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) pressures and a 20% increase in cardiac output, there was not a significant change in QRS duration, RMS, or LAS. Before and after therapy late potentials, defined as abnormal QRS duration RMS, or LAS, were present in 14 (52%) patients with filtering at 25 Hz and in 22 (81%) patients with filtering at 40 Hz. The signal-averaged ECG after hemodynamic improvement predicted the results during exacerbation of heart failure in all patients. Thus in patients with advanced heart failure the signal-averaged ECG obtained after hemodynamic improvement reflects the findings during exacerbation of heart failure. \nA novel cyclin encoded by a bcl1-linked candidate oncogene We have previously identified a candidate oncogene (PRAD1 or D11S287E) on chromosome 11q13 which is clonally rearranged with the parathyroid hormone locus in a subset of benign parathyroid tumours. We now report that a cloned human placental PRAD1 complementary DNA encodes a protein of 295 amino acids with sequence similarities to the cyclins. Cyclins can form a complex with and activate p34cdc2 protein kinase, thereby regulating progress through the cell cycle. PRAD 1 messenger RNA levels vary dramatically across the cell cycle in HeLa cells. Addition of the PRAD1 protein to interphase clam embryo lysates containing inactive p34cdc2 kinase and lacking endogenous cyclins allows it to be isolated using beads bearing p13suc1, a yeast protein that binds cdc2 and related kinases with high affinity and coprecipitates kinase-associated proteins. Addition of PRAD1 also induces phosphorylation of histone H1, a preferred substrate of cdc2. These data suggest that PRAD1 encodes a novel cyclin whose overexpression may play an important part in the development of various tumours with abnormalities in 11q13. \nUse of the perforated balloon catheter to infuse marker substances into diseased coronary artery walls after experimental postmortem angioplasty. A perforated balloon catheter was used in human coronary arteries after postmortem angioplasty had been performed. The catheter used has a standard angioplasty balloon with a pattern of laser-produced holes, 25 microns in size, which generate streams of fluid under pressure. Studies of the routes by which marker substances enter diseased arterial tissue when infused by the perforated balloon after experimental angioplasty are described. A colored marker dye entered the new crevices and dissection planes created by the angioplasty, but did not extend greater than 2 cm either proximal or distal to the perfused segment. Horseradish peroxidase entered tissue not only from the lumen and adventitia as occurs with its infusion into normal tissue with the perforated balloon, but also extended from new crevices and dissection planes created by the angioplasty. Platelet aggregation, coagulation and cell proliferation, the likely causes of restenosis after angioplasty, originate in the sites of greatest tissue disruption and blood stasis. These postmortem studies suggest that active drugs are delivered to the arterial wall in a manner likely to be effective in preventing these events. \nAcquired Brown's syndrome associated with hypogammaglobulinemia. We describe a 10-year-old girl with hypogammaglobulinemia who presented initially with painless progressive diplopia on right upward gaze and associated tenderness in the area of the superior oblique tendon (Brown's syndrome). She was given prednisone (40 mg/day) with gradual improvement of her symptoms. Prednisone was tapered and her symptoms remained unchanged for 10 months. She then experienced rapid deterioration. Prednisone was reinstituted with similar improvement and then therapy was switched to naproxen. She remains with only slight diplopia on extreme upward gaze. \nImproving results in the treatment of gastric cancer: an 11-year audit. Of 280 patients presenting to one hospital with gastric cancer between 1975 and 1985, 97 (35 per cent) did not undergo surgery and 29 per cent (54 out of 183) of those who did had no resection performed. The 30-day operative mortality rate in the study period was 15 per cent (28 out of 183) but in the subsequent 4-year period this fell to 7 per cent (5 out of 69). The survival rate correlated significantly with depth of invasion but not with tumour site or degree of differentiation. The incidence of early gastric cancer in this series was 5 per cent but the 5-year survival rate in this group was 52 per cent suggesting that the true incidence might be even lower. The overall 5-year survival rate in our area 20 years ago was only 5.2 per cent but in this series it was 11 per cent overall and 24 per cent after resection, and with actuarial correction 15 per cent overall and 28 per cent after resection. The continuing improvement in operative mortality rates and in 5-year survival rates gives grounds for optimism, but the disease must be diagnosed earlier if this improvement in outlook is to continue. \ngamma-Hydroxybutyrate: a health-food product producing coma and seizurelike activity. Sixteen cases of adverse effects due to a new health-food product, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), were reported to the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Poison Control Center in the 5-month period from June to October 1990. Cases have also been reported in eight other states. Adverse effects included coma (four patients) and tonic-clonic seizurelike activity (two patients). Doses ranged from 1/4 teaspoon to 4 tablespoons. Acute symptoms resolved within 7 hours. GHB was investigated as an anesthetic agent during the 1960s until seizures and lack of analgesia precluded its use. It was recently introduced in the health-food market as a food supplement for body builders with claims of anabolic effects by stimulating growth hormone release. GHB remains under investigational new drug status with the Food and Drug Administration and is illegal for over the counter sale. The Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services has prohibited further sale of this product in California as have health departments in Florida and South Carolina; however, new cases continue to be reported. Health professionals should be aware of the potential health hazards of GHB. \nConstitutive expression of multiple growth factor genes by melanoma cells but not normal melanocytes. In a panel of metastatic melanoma cell lines we found steady-state mRNA transcripts for multiple growth factors including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A, PDGF-B, transforming growth factor (TGF)- beta 1, TGF- alpha, melanoma growth-stimulating activity (MGSA), interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta but not insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 or IGF-2. Expression of growth factor genes was constitutive because prior to RNA extraction melanoma cells were maintained in a chemically defined culture medium free of exogenous growth factors. Each of four cell lines had an individual pattern of expression of either two, four, five, or seven growth factors; however, all cell lines shared expression of the bFGF gene. Two strains of normal melanocytes expressed TGF- beta 1 but not bFGF, PDGF, TGF- alpha , or MGSA mRNA at detectable levels. We tested growth-modulatory effects of the growth factors most frequently expressed by melanoma cells (bFGF, TGF- alpha, TGF- beta, PDGF). None of these stimulated melanoma cell growth consistently, whereas exogenous, acid-activated TGF- beta inhibited melanoma growth at concentrations greater than 10 ng/ml, suggesting that bioactive TGF- beta may represent a physiologic growth inhibitor. Neither neutralizing antisera to PDGF or TGF- alpha nor a monoclonal antibody to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor inhibited melanoma cell growth. Our results indicate that multiple growth factors are expressed simultaneously and constitutively by melanoma cells but not normal melanocytes in culture. Expression of bFGF is a common feature underscoring the significance of bFGF as an autocrine factor for melanoma cells as described earlier. Secreted PDGF and TGF- alpha are apparently not involved in or not essential for autocrine growth stimulation of melanoma cells. \nEvents in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST): mortality in the entire population enrolled [published erratum appears in J Am Coll Cardiol 1991 Sep;18(3):888] To test the hypothesis that suppression of ventricular arrhythmias by antiarrhythmic drugs after myocardial infarction improves survival, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) was initiated. Suppression was evaluated before randomization during an open label titration period. Patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed were randomized in the main study and those whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed were randomized in a substudy. Overall survival and survival free of arrhythmic death or cardiac arrest were lower [corrected] in patients treated with encainide or flecainide than in patients treated with placebo. However, the death rate in patients randomized to placebo therapy was lower than expected. This report describes the survival experience of all patients enrolled in CAST and compares it with mortality in other studies of patients with ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. As of April 18, 1989, 2,371 patients had enrolled in CAST and entered prerandomization, open label titration: 1,913 (81%) were randomized to double-blind, placebo-controlled therapy (1,775 patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed and 138 patients whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed during open label titration); and 458 patients (19%) were not randomized because they were still in titration, had died during titration or had withdrawn. Including all patients who enrolled in CAST, the actuarial (Kaplan-Meier) estimate of 1-year mortality was 10.3%. To estimate the \"natural\" mortality rate of patients enrolled in CAST, an analysis was done that adjusted for deaths that might be attributable to encainide or flecainide treatment either during prerandomization, open label drug titration or after randomization. Because the censoring procedure excluded patients treated with encainide or flecainide after randomization, the mortality estimate will be less than the unadjusted mortality estimate of 10.3%. \nLeft-sided pleural effusion secondary to splenic vein thrombosis. A previously unrecognized relationship. The association of left-sided pleural effusion and subcapsular splenic hematoma was reported in 1980. We describe a patient in whom a left-sided pleural effusion resulted from splenic vein thrombosis, a relationship not previously reported. Splenectomy was performed, demonstrating the spleen to be enlarged and hemorrhagic. The pleural effusion did not recur after splenectomy. The three effusions due to splenic hematomas reported previously cleared only after splenectomy, suggesting splenectomy may be necessary to prevent reaccumulation. We propose possible pathophysiologic mechanisms and recommend that splenic vein thrombosis be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained left-sided pleural effusions. \nAdrenal carcinoma presenting as a lesion resembling cutaneous angiosarcoma. A case is reported of adrenal carcinoma presenting as an angiosarcoma-like metastasis in the scalp. Adrenal carcinoma is a rare tumor, and it metastasizes to skin rarely. The authors discuss the features of this tumor that led to a diagnosis of angiosarcoma and the means by which such a metastasis may be distinguished from vascular tumors. \nOutcome of patients who were admitted to a new short-stay unit to \"rule-out\" myocardial infarction. For emergency room patients with a low probability of acute myocardial infarction, we established a new short-stay coronary observation unit, a 2-bed nonintensive care unit with telemetry monitoring adjacent to the emergency room. Of 512 consecutive admissions to the coronary observation unit, 425 (83%) were discharged home without evidence of acute myocardial infarction or serious complications (mean length of stay, 1.2 days; median length of stay, 1 day); 87 (17%) were transferred to other hospital beds. The rate of acute myocardial infarction was 3%. No deaths and only 1 serious complication occurred in the coronary observation unit. At 6 month follow-up, the cardiac survival rate was 99% for patients sent home directly from this unit. It is concluded that the coronary observation unit is safe and adequate for ruling out acute myocardial infarction in a defined subset of patients. Short-stay units, however, encourage early discharges which, when premature, may miss patients who are at risk of having complications shortly thereafter. Strategies such as mandatory but expeditious predischarge stress testing to encourage early but not premature discharge may augment the efficiency of coronary observation units. \nNecrotizing fasciitis and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We have presented a case of fulminant necrotizing fasciitis that occurred after excessive NSAID intake with granulocytopenia. This case parallels those previously reported as outlined in the above discussion. We concur with previous investigators who have concluded that NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with phlebitis or apparently benign inflammatory cutaneous lesions. \nPreservation of pulsatile luteinizing hormone release during postpartum lactational amenorrhea. To evaluate the pulsatile mode of immunoactive LH release during physiological lactational amenorrhea, we withdrew blood samples at 10-min intervals for 24 h from breastfeeding women (n = 9) at both 3 weeks and 3 months postpartum. Nonlactating women (n = 7) were sampled similarly in the early follicular phase of the normal menstrual cycle. Objective LH pulse analysis revealed that the mean frequencies of pulsatile LH release were similar at both times postpartum and in menstruating young women. By 3 months postpartum, mean serum PRL concentrations had declined 50%, and serum LH peak areas doubled. In contrast, LH interpulse interval, peak duration, and maximal, incremental, and fractional LH pulse amplitude did not change significantly. When deconvolution analysis was used to assess pituitary responses to two pulses of exogenous GnRH at 3 months (vs. 3 weeks) postpartum, we found significant increases in maximal LH secretory rates and the total mass of LH secreted. There was no change in the duration or timing of the evoked LH secretory burst and/or the estimated half-life of endogenous LH. In summary, during lactational amenorrhea, pulsatile LH release occurs at a mean frequency no different from that in the normal early follicular phase. As hyperprolactinemia wanes, there is increased pituitary responsiveness to exogenously administered GnRH and a doubling of spontaneous serum LH concentration peak areas. Such amplitude changes are consistent with the hypothesis of increased endogenous GnRH drive (e.g. augmented GnRH secretion per burst and/or increased pituitary responsiveness to available GnRH) during recovery of the postpartum hypothalamopituitary-ovarian axis. \nRapid changes of atrial natriuretic peptide concentration during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In 34 patients undergoing routine coronary angioplasty, concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), plasma renin (PR), and plasma aldosterone (PA) were estimated before, during, and after vessel occlusion and were correlated with hemodynamic changes. For the group as a whole, averaged right atrial pressure rose significantly (p less than 0.001) from 4.4 +/- 1.8 mm Hg at baseline to 6.7 +/- 3.0 mm Hg during vessel occlusion, and average right atrial ANP concentrations increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 50.1 +/- 18.8 pg/ml to 59.7 +/- 21.4 pg/ml during balloon inflation. Data analysis of subgroups did not show any differences in right atrial pressure elevations between patients with left anterior descending artery (LAD) or right coronary artery (RCA) disease; ANP elevation was significant only in patients with LAD occlusion (p less than 0.001). In individual patients no statistically significant correlations were found to be present between changes in right atrial pressures and changes in atrial ANP concentrations. During vessel occlusion, PR dropped from 0.86 +/- 1.11 ng/ml/hr to 0.65 +/- 0.85 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.001) in all patients, and PA decreased from 63.0 +/- 50.9 ng/ml to 52.2 +/- 43.4 ng/ml (p less than 0.01). Our data support the concept that, although an increase in right atrial pressure leads to ANP release in the majority of patients, atrial pressure and stretch are not the only regulatory factors of ANP release in humans. \nPrimary ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic and enteropathic spondyloarthropathy: a controlled analysis. Within our ankylosing spondylitis (AS) population (n = 1331), 85% (n = 1128) had primary AS (1 degree AS), 9% (n = 121) had psoriatic AS (PsAS) and 6% (n = 82) enteropathic AS (IBDAS). In an attempt to explore further the relationship between 1 degree AS and the secondary spondyloarthritides, we evaluated 121 consecutive patients with PsAS and 82 with IBDAS, as well as 202 controls with primary disease. The patients were matched for sex and age at review PsAS:48.1 (SD 11.3) years vs 1 degree AS:48.4 (SD 11.5), and IBDAS:46.0 (SD 12.7) vs 1 degree AS:45.9 (SD 12.7). The sex distribution for IBDAS (M:F, 1:1), was significantly less (p less than 0.001) than that for PsAS (M:F, 3.5:1) or 1 degree AS (M:F, 2.4:1). Overall, compared to 1 degree AS the PsAS and IBDAS tended to have greater disease severity as defined by e.g., (1) those taking non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, 86 vs 72% (p less than 0.01) and 71 vs 60% (p less than 0.05), respectively; (2) decreased spinal mobility (scale 0-8) 5.0 (SD 2.0) vs 4.4 (SD 2.3); p = 0.029 and 4.9 (SD 2.0) vs 3.9 (SD 2.4); p = 0.024, respectively; and (3) PsAS resulted in a higher AIMS pain score; 4.9 (SD 2.5) vs 4.0 (SD 2.4): p = 0.042. By contrast, peripheral joint involvement, number of total hip replacements and capacity for employment were similar in all 3 groups. In conclusion (1) among the AS population the prevalence of 1 degree AS, PsAS and IBDAS is 90, 6 and 4%, respectively. \nChronic wounds and delusions of parasitosis in the drug abuser. Plastic surgeons are routinely consulted about the care of difficult or chronic wounds. Most of these wounds have a physiologic basis and are treated according to basic wound-healing principles. Patients with factitious wounds are difficult to treat and present diagnostic dilemmas. We present a case and review of the literature of drug-induced delusions of parasitosis to inform plastic surgeons of this important entity and for consideration in the differential diagnosis of chronic wounds. \nUsefulness of transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of conditions mimicking aortic dissection. Between September 1987 and April 1989, forty patients suspected to have aortic dissection were evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography. Aortic dissection was identified in 18 patients. This study evaluated the ability of transesophageal echocardiography in the assessment of the 22 patients in whom aortic dissection was not found. A range of pathologic conditions was diagnosed in these patients. Five patients had ischemic heart disease when they were initially seen. Among the remaining 17 only one patient had a normal aorta. Aortic disease was present in the other 16 patients with aortic dilatation in 10. Atheromas were detected in seven patients with concomitant aortic dilatation in five of them. An extrinsic aortic mass was present in two patients. Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified an anastomotic leak at the site of left coronary artery implantation in a patient with a recent Bentall procedure, and a large mobile clot within the proximal descending aorta in a patient with blunt chest trauma. These findings obviated the need for other tests in 15 patients and led to surgery in four with no ancillary tests performed in three of them. Thus transesophageal echocardiography has an important role in assessing patients with suspected dissection. Aortic disease is common even in patients in whom aortic dissection is excluded, and some of the conditions can be just as life-threatening as dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography not only reliably identifies dissection but can also detect luminal and extraluminal diseases not adequately visualized by other modalities. \nTegmental dehiscence and brain herniation into the middle ear cleft. The tegmen tympani may occasionally be breached by herniation of the temporal lobe with or without dural cover. The clinical presentation may be obvious with CSF otorrhoea but less so with apparent middle ear effusion, CSF rhinnorrhoea, conductive hearing loss, recurrent meningitis or intracranial sepsis. Diagnosis requires suspicion of the condition, which may be aided by radiological imaging. Surgical repair is to be recommended: various techniques are available but bone enveloped by fascia placed by subtemporal approach is preferred. The features of this problem are highlighted by four cases. \nProspective evaluation of unilateral adrenal masses in patients with operable non-small-cell lung cancer. Although adrenal metastases are frequently noted with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at autopsy, their incidence in patients with operable NSCLC is unclear. We prospectively assessed consecutive patients with otherwise operable NSCLC for the incidence and histology of unilateral adrenal masses. Assessment included blood chemistries, lung function tests, bronchoscopy, chest x-ray, bone scan, and computed tomography (CT) of the head, chest, and upper abdomen. Of 246 patients with otherwise operable NSCLC, 10 (4.1%) had a unilateral adrenal mass. Unilateral adrenal masses were needle-aspirated under CT control. If cytology was nondiagnostic, adrenalectomy was performed. Four (40%) of 10 patients had adrenal metastases proven by needle aspiration. Of the six (60%) patients with benign unilateral adrenal masses, one was demonstrated by needle aspiration. In the other five patients, a nondiagnostic needle aspiration led to adrenalectomy, which yielded two adenomas, two hyperplastic nodules, and one hemorrhagic cyst. There was no significant difference between the patients with benign and metastatic unilateral adrenal masses with respect to patient age or stage and size of adrenal mass. Patients with benign unilateral adrenal masses underwent curative resection of their NSCLC and had significantly prolonged survival compared with patients with metastatic unilateral adrenal masses treated with chemotherapy (P = .037). Median survival of patients with benign and metastatic unilateral adrenal masses was greater than 30 months and 9 months, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of unilatera",
