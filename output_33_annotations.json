Normal human left ventricular architecture comprises a highly aligned array of cardiac myofibers whose orientation depends on transmural location. This study was designed to determine whether measurement of integrated backscatter could be used detect the progressive transmural shift of myofiber alignment that occurs from epicardium to endocardium in human ventricular wall segments. Integrated backscatter was measured at 32 transmural levels in seven cylindrical biopsy specimens (1.4 cm diam) sampled from normal regions of six explanted fixed human hearts by insonification of samples at 180 independent angles in 2 degrees steps around their entire circumference with a 5-MHz broadband piezoelectric transducer. Histologic analysis was performed to determine fiber orientation. Integrated backscatter varied approximately as a sinusoidal function of the angle of insonification at each transmural level. Greater integrated backscatter was observed for insonification perpendicular as compared with parallel to fibers (difference = 14.5 +/- 0.6 dB). Ultrasonic analysis revealed a progressive transmural shift in fiber orientation of approximately 9.2 +/- 0.7 degrees/mm of tissue. Histologic analysis revealed a concordant shift in fiber orientation of 7.9 +/- 0.8 degrees/mm of tissue. Thus, human myocardium manifests anisotropy of ultrasonic scattering that may be useful for characterization of the intramural fiber alignment and overall three-dimensional organization of cardiac myofibers. \nPlasma catecholamines in patients with presinusoidal portal hypertension: comparison with cirrhotic patients and nonportal hypertensive subjects. During a hemodynamic study, plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured in the pulmonary artery and in the hepatic vein in 18 presinusoidal portal hypertensive patients. Results were compared with those in 15 nonportal hypertensive subjects and in 24 cirrhotic patients in good condition (grade A, according to Pugh's classification). Plasma norepinephrine concentrations in the pulmonary artery or in the hepatic vein were not significantly different between nonportal hypertensive subjects (mean +/- S.E.M.: 271 +/- 36 and 83 +/- 11 pg/ml, respectively) and presinusoidal portal hypertensive patients (273 +/- 33 and 84 +/- 11 pg/ml, respectively). These concentrations were, however, elevated in cirrhotic patients (408 +/- 47 and 256 +/- 45 pg/ml, p less than 0.05 in comparison with the two other groups). These differences suggest that increased sympathetic nervous activity in cirrhosis is associated with the presence of liver disease or increase in sinusoidal pressure. Differences in plasma epinephrine concentrations were not significant among the three groups of patients. However, the existence of a significant correlation between pulmonary artery plasma epinephrine concentration and cardiac index (r2 = 0.46, p less than 0.01) in patients with presinusoidal portal hypertension suggests that the adrenal medulla could play a role in the pathophysiology of the hyperkinetic syndrome of these patients. \nMRC European Carotid Surgery Trial: interim results for symptomatic patients with severe (70-99%) or with mild (0-29%) carotid stenosis. European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group The European Carotid Surgery Trial is a multicentre trial of carotid endarterectomy for patients who, after a carotid territory non-disabling ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or retinal infarct, are found to have a stenotic lesion in the relevant (ipsilateral) carotid artery. Over the past 10 years 2518 patients have been randomised, and the mean follow-up is now almost 3 years among the 2200 thus far available for analysis of the incidence of strokes that lasted more than 7 days. For the patients with \"moderate\" (30-69%) stenosis on their prerandomisation angiogram the balance of surgical risk and eventual benefit remains uncertain, and full recruitment continues. For 374 patients with only \"mild\" (0-29%) stenosis there was little 3-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, even in the absence of surgery, so any 3-year benefits of surgery were small, and were outweighed by its early risks. For 778 patients with \"severe\" (70-99%) stenosis, however, the risks of surgery were significantly outweighed by the later benefits: although 7.5% had a stroke (or died) within 30 days of surgery, during the next 3 years the risks of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke were (by life-table analysis) an extra 2.8% for surgery-allocated and 16.8% for control patients (a sixfold reduction, p less than 0.0001). There was also a small reduction in other strokes, and at 3 years the total risk of surgical death, surgical stroke, ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, or any other stroke was 12.3% for surgery and 21.9% for control (difference 9.6% SD 3.3, 2p less than 0.01). The main concern was to avoid disabling or fatal events, and, among severe stenosis patients, 3.7% had a disabling stroke (or died) within 30 days of surgery, an extra 1.1% surgery versus 8.4% control (p less than 0.0001) had a disabling or fatal ipsilateral ischaemic stroke by 3 years, and the total 3-year risk of any disabling or fatal stroke (or surgical death) was 6.0% surgery versus 11.0% control (overall difference 5.0% SD 2.3, 2p less than 0.05); but, for disabling or fatal stroke the control risks seemed to diminish after the first year, so delay of surgery by just a few months after clinical presentation might make this overall difference non-significant. \nManagement of advanced retinopathy of prematurity in the older patient. The authors studied 11 eyes of 10 patients who complained of a recent decrease in vision and whose eyes had the clinical appearance of stage 5 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) as diagnosed by the presence of a dense, opaque retrolenticular membrane. Patients ranged in age from 4 to 33 years, and birth weights ranged from 680 to 1077 g. All eyes underwent vitrectomy, lensectomy, and membrane peeling and were found intraoperatively to have areas of retina that were attached (stage 4B). Preoperatively, a reproducible visual-evoked potential waveform appeared to better predict this retinal configuration and potential retinal function than did the contact B scan ultrasound of the globe. Postoperatively, seven (63.6%) eyes demonstrated an improvement in vision. Vitreous surgery may be beneficial in selected eyes of older patients with advanced ROP to clear media opacities and to uncover areas of functional, attached retina, which may allow these patients to more effectively use the vision they possess. \nPharmacologic elevation of blood inorganic phosphate in hypoxemic patients with COPD. We have shown that in patients with COPD, myocardial efficiency during exercise is enhanced following acute elevations of plasma phosphate (Pi). A decrease in Hb-O2 affinity (increase in P50) was not responsible for the improvement. We postulated that the physiologic benefit was due to the acute reversal of a subclinical myocardial Pi depletion. To further test this hypothesis in a chronic state, we studied nine stable hypoxemic (PaO2 = 64 +/- 2 mm Hg [+/- SEM]) patients with COPD over five weeks: two weeks at normal plasma Pi; and three weeks at elevated plasma Pi, induced by etidronate disodium (Didronel; 750 mg orally daily). Administration of etidronate disodium increased (p less than 0.05) plasma level of Pi (4.4 +/- 0.2 to 5.8 +/- 0.1 mg/dl), RBC level of Pi (3.1 +/- 0.2 to 4.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dl), RBC level of 2,3-DPG (16.2 +/- 1.1 to 21.3 g+/- 1.3 mumol/g of Hb) and P50 (23.7 +/- 0.5 to 26.0 +/- 0.8 mm Hg). At the end of the treatment, the widening of the C(a-v)O2 with exercise (7.1 +/- 0.8 to 8.9 +/- 0.6 ml/dl) was less pronounced than under control conditions (6.9 +/- 0.4 to 10.1 +/- 0.6 ml/dl; p less than 0.02); concomitantly, the crossover point (COP; the PaO2 below which a rightward-shifted Hb-O2 curve causes the C(a-v)O2 to become narrower rather than wider) increased (37 +/- 2 to 49 +/- 1 mm Hg). Indicators of myocardial work efficiency were not affected by etidronate disodium at rest or during exercise. We postulate that during exercise the potential beneficial effect of the rightward shift of the Hb-O2 curve upon cardiac function was negated by the fall of PaO2 to or below the COP level, a situation which would limit increases in tissue O2 extraction. \nMethods to diminish intraoperative blood loss. With the subcutaneous injection of a saline-vasopressor solution under donor sites and debrided areas, a significant reduction in intraoperative blood transfusions was accomplished. No problems in healing of donor sites or skin grafts were encountered. Vasodilating anesthetics and ketamine can overcome the local vasopressor action. Discontinuing or reducing the concentration of these agents results in less bleeding from the wound. \nFacial dystonia, essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. Movement disorders, or dyskinesias, in the facial region may be categorized in several ways. Dystonic movement disorders in the cranial-cervical region, including essential blepharospasm, Meige syndrome and spasmodic torticollis, are characterized by uncontrollable squeezing movements in the face and neck. These disorders typically present in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Essential blepharospasm is particularly debilitating, as the involuntary eyelid closure that accompanies this condition may result in functional blindness with an otherwise normal visual pathway. Hemifacial spasm is an intermittent, unilateral, spasmodic contraction of the muscles innervated by the facial nerve. This disorder usually presents in the third or fourth decade and has a different underlying pathophysiology than the dystonias. Botulinum A toxin therapy has largely supplanted surgical intervention in the treatment of essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. \nMetastatic angiosarcoma of the brain. Two patients with metastatic angiosarcoma of the brain are described. In one, a 17-year-old man, the tumor was located at the pineal region and exhibited significant vascularity. It was sensitive to radiation therapy and disappeared after radiation of 50 Gy; however, it recurred after 1 year and a new lesion was found in the liver. The other patient is a 31-year-old woman who experienced sudden onset of headache. Computed tomography scan revealed three separate masses in the brain. One tumor was surgically removed. The other two were sensitive to radiation therapy and disappeared after radiation of 40 Gy. A new lesion was found in the femur 16 months after the operation. Brain metastasis from angiosarcoma is exceedingly rare. Both patients developed symptoms with intracranial hemorrhage. The diagnosis of the metastatic lesions preceded diagnosis of the primary lesion by 12 and 16 months, respectively. Ulex europaeus 1 lectin and factor VIII were very useful in establishing the diagnosis of angiosarcoma. \nProduction of transforming growth factor alpha by hamster eosinophils. Previously it was demonstrated that malignant transformation of the Syrian hamster cheek pouch mucosa is associated with the expression of TGF-alpha. Therefore in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the cellular sources of TGF-alpha production in this model system. Surprisingly one cell type in the inflammatory infiltrate present in the connective tissue adjacent to the transformed epithelium represented a major source of TGF-alpha mRNA. Detailed analysis of these cells revealed that they were eosinophils. In addition to TGF-alpha mRNA, about 40% of the eosinophils associated with the oral tumors exhibited TGF-alpha product reactive with a monoclonal antibody against the C terminus of the mature TGF-alpha peptide. Normal hamster bone marrow eosinophils also exhibited TGF-alpha mRNA and product by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that the eosinophil represents a biologically significant source of TGF-alpha. \nGeneral moderate hypothermia in the surgical treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. The diagnosis and surgical treatment of aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta is difficult and some aspects of management remain controversial. We report 53 patients treated in the period 1983-1988; 25.9% of them had previously been erroneously diagnosed as having mediastinal cysts or tumours. Duplex scanning and computerised tomography were valuable adjuncts in establishing the correct diagnosis, which was confirmed by aortography in 52 patients. Of 49 patients operated upon electively three died with a mortality rate of 6.1%; of the 4 patients operated upon as emergencies 2 died. Fifty patients survived the operative procedure and of the 3 operated upon under normothermia 1 developed paraplegia, whereas of the 47 patients operated upon under moderate hypothermia (30 degrees-31 degrees C) only 1 developed paraplegia. \nHBx gene of hepatitis B virus induces liver cancer in transgenic mice. The exact role of hepatitis B virus in the development of liver cancer is not known. The recent identification of a viral regulatory gene HBx suggests a possible direct involvement of the virus whereby the HBx protein, acting as a transcriptional transactivator of viral genes, may alter host gene expression and lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. We have tested this possibility of placing the entire HBx gene under its own regulatory elements directly into the germline of mice. Transgenic animals harbouring this viral gene succumbed to progressive histopathological changes specifically in the liver, beginning with multifocal areas of altered hepatocytes, followed by the appearance of benign adenomas, and proceeding to the development of malignant carcinomas. Male mice developed disease and died much earlier than females. This transgenic animal model appears ideal for defining the molecular events that follow the expression of the viral HBx gene and are responsible for the development of liver cancer. \nLong-latency neurodegenerative disease in the western Pacific. The western Pacific parkinsonism-dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis complex is a prototypical neurodegenerative disorder found among inhabitants of Guam, New Guinea (Irian Jaya, Indonesia) and Japan (Kii Peninsula, Honshu). Nonviral environmental factors peculiar to the affected populations seem to play a prominent etiologic role. Although cause-effect relationships cannot be established by epidemiologic studies alone, we have shown in all three affected population groups that individuals develop the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis variant of this disorder after heavy exposure to the raw or incompletely detoxified seed of neurotoxic cycad plants. Since long periods may elapse between cycad exposure and the appearance of neurological disease in humans, cycads may harbor a \"slow toxin\" that causes the postmitotic neuron to undergo slow irreversible degeneration. Two cycad neurotoxins are recognized, one of which (cycasin) is known to have long-latency effects (tumorigenesis) on mitotic neurons and replicating cells in other tissues. This paper explores the possible relationship between tumorigenesis and long-latency neurotoxicity, and discusses possible biologic markers of cycad exposure and subclinical neurodegenerative disease. \nChronic posttraumatic aortic pseudoaneurysm. Recognition before rupture. Few patients survive transection of the aorta caused by blunt trauma. However, among those who do are a small number who go on to live with an unrecognized pseudoaneurysm that may rupture at any time. Because these aneurysms may be mistaken for more common disease processes, such as hilar adenopathy, atherosclerotic aneurysm, or neoplasia, the authors describe radiographic findings that suggest the correct diagnosis. \nExperimental therapy of human glioma by means of a genetically engineered virus mutant. Malignant gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors and are almost always fatal. A thymidine kinase-negative mutant of herpes simplex virus-1 (dlsptk) that is attenuated for neurovirulence was tested as a possible treatment for gliomas. In cell culture, dlsptk killed two long-term human glioma lines and three short-term human glioma cell populations. In nude mice with implanted subcutaneous and subrenal U87 human gliomas, intraneoplastic inoculation of dlsptk caused growth inhibition. In nude mice with intracranial U87 gliomas, intraneoplastic inoculation of dlsptk prolonged survival. Genetically engineered viruses such as dlsptk merit further evaluation as novel antineoplastic agents. \nOral cancer screening in the elderly. Oral cancers represent approximately 3% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States. Oral cancer is one-fifth as common as cancer of the breast, colon, and lung but more than twice as common as cervical cancer. Incidence rates for oral cancer are highest among older men. Epidemiologic data identify alcohol and tobacco as major risk factors associated with the disease. Screening for oral cancer is a simple, non-invasive procedure which can be easily incorporated into the comprehensive assessment of older patients. Oral cancer screening can detect early, localized lesions which are associated with an improved prognosis. Five-year survival rates are more than four times greater in individuals with localized lesions than those with distant metastases. Since older Americans visit their physician more often than their dentist, the physician's medical examination provides an excellent opportunity to screen for oral cancers. \nA prion protein missense variant is integrated in kuru plaque cores in patients with Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome. Kuru plaques are the pathologic hallmark in Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome (GSS). To demonstrate that prion protein (PrP) is a component of kuru plaque cores, we fractionated and sequenced kuru plaque core derived peptides, following digestion with Achromobacter lyticus protease I. We identified 3 PrP-derived peptides by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and found a fragment of digests derived from a missense variant of PrP. The variant PrP was also present in the prion rod fraction in patients with GSS. This substitution may play a major role in cerebral amyloidogenesis. \nMaternal reporting of behaviour following very severe blunt head injury. Mothers of 40 very severely head injured male subjects rated their son's behaviour on the Current Behaviour Scale and their ratings were compared with mothers' ratings of 40 control male subjects. The scale was able to discriminate the two groups, by utilising two factors--loss of emotional control and loss of motivation. The mothers' level of emotional distress was closely related to their reporting of loss of emotional control in their sons, but reporting of loss of motivation, or lowered arousal, was strongly predicted by the functional disability of the son. The utility of refining the measurement of post-trauma behaviour is discussed. \nSonographic visualization of the ureter in pregnancy. We describe a method of differentiating physiological from pathological dilatation of the renal collecting system in pregnant patients. In physiological hydronephrosis the dilated ureter extends down only to the level of the common iliac artery. In 2 patients with distal ureteral stones a dilated ureter was visualized past the vessels. To determine the frequency and reliability of visualizing the ureters in pregnant patients 105 consecutive asymptomatic pregnant patients were examined. Hydronephrosis was found in 83 kidneys in 59 of the patients. The dilated ureter was visualized in 64 of the renal units. The anatomy was well demonstrated by color flow Doppler scanning and in all of these cases the dilated ureter was seen to taper where it crossed the common iliac artery. These results suggest that the presence of a dilated ureter past the iliac artery is strong evidence for pathological distal ureteral obstruction in pregnancy. \nLymphangiosarcoma associated with lymphedema in a man with Maffucci's syndrome. A man with Maffucci's syndrome and lifelong lymphedema in the right lower extremity had a lymphangiosarcoma in the same extremity. Despite amputation of the limb and radiotherapy, he died several months later of pulmonary metastases. Malignancies of vascular origin rarely have been reported in this syndrome. Our patient's features suggest that lymphedema may predispose patients with Maffucci's syndrome to the development of lymphangiosarcoma. \nTransient retrocochlear low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss: a new clinical entity. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) of varying types and extent developed in a number of the 963 patients who underwent microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm. Fourteen of the patients with hearing loss had transient low-frequency SNHL. Low-frequency SNHL is seldom noted in patients with retrocochlear hearing loss, but five of these patients had Horner's syndrome or bulbar palsy. The results of Bekesy audiometry, auditory brainstem response, and electrocochleography in the patients were also suggestive of brainstem pathology. Surgical records revealed that all of them had excessively short perforating arteries surrounding the entry zone of nerves VII and VIII, so that they had to be stretched during surgery. Occlusion of perforating arteries is suspected to have caused lateral brainstem infarction around the entry zone of nerves VII and VIII, and resulted in low-frequency SNHL. \nA novel vitamin D3 analog, 22-oxa-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, inhibits the growth of human breast cancer in vitro and in vivo without causing hypercalcemia. Although 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] has been shown to inhibit the growth of certain malignant cells, its hypercalcemic effect has prevented clinical application. We have recently developed a novel vitamin D3 analog, 22-oxa-1,25-(OH)2D3 (OCT), that is capable of promoting differentiation and inhibiting proliferation without inducing hypercalcemia. The present study was undertaken to determine whether OCT could be applied for the treatment of breast cancer with or without estrogen receptor (ER). OCT inhibited the proliferation of both ER-positive (MCF-7, T-47D, and ZR-75-1) and ER-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and BT-20) in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as determined by cell number and [3H]thymidine uptake. The antiproliferative effect was observed with a concentration as low as 10(-11) M OCT, and treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10(-8) M OCT for 8 days caused more than a 50% reduction in cell number compared with that of vehicle-treated cells. OCT was approximately 1 order of magnitude more potent than 1,25-(OH)2D3 in inhibiting the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. The in vivo effect of OCT was examined in athymic mice implanted with ER-negative MX-1 tumor, which was established as the xenograft derived from human breast carcinoma. Intratumor administration of OCT three times a week remarkably delayed the growth of MX-1 tumor in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The antitumor effect of 1 microgram/kg BW OCT was greater than that of 500 microgram/kg BW adriamycin, and the relative tumor weights in each group on day 26 were 29.7% and 50.5% of that in the vehicle-treated group, respectively. The effects of OCT and adriamycin were additive, and the relative tumor weight after 26 days of combined treatment was 21.7% of that in the vehicle-treated group. Oral administration of OCT was also effective, and the relative tumor weight in the OCT-treated group (1 microgram/kg BW) was 54.6 +/- 0.1% (mean +/- SEM) of that in the vehicle-treated group. Neither intratumor nor oral administration of OCT raised the serum calcium level in these animals. These results demonstrate that OCT is a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of breast cancer cells with or without ER and that OCT inhibits the growth of breast cancer in vivo without inducing hypercalcemia. We suggest that OCT may provide a new strategy for the treatment of breast carcinoma regardless of ER status. \nPEG ileus. A new cause of small bowel obstruction. A case of small bowel obstruction due to a lodged percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube inner bumper is described. Most probably inner bumper lodgement in the terminal ileum is related to its size. Laparotomy was required to remove the bumper and relieve the obstruction. We suggest that all percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy bumpers be retrieved endoscopically when the PEG tube is removed or replaced unless a collapsible inner bumper is used. \nA phase II study of the combination of carboplatin and ifosfamide in previously untreated metastatic small cell lung carcinoma. This Phase II study evaluated the combination of two active agents in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC): carboplatin and ifosfamide. Thirty previously untreated patients (27 men and 3 women) with a median age of 59 years were included in this study. Twelve patients had one metastatic site and 18 had two or more metastatic sites. The median performance status was 80%. The chemotherapy (CT) regimen administered during the course of this study consisted of carboplatin (300 mg/m2) and ifosfamide (4 g/m2) plus mesna every 4 weeks. All 30 patients were evaluable: 1 achieved a complete remission (CR) and 18 achieved a partial remission (PR) (objective response rate, 63%). The median response time was 3 months and the median survival time was 8 months (range, 1 to 25+ months). Bone marrow toxicity was Grade III in three patients and Grade IV in four patients. The carboplatin and ifosfamide combination was well tolerated. No cross-resistance with the doxorubicin and etoposide regimen was established because 4 of 11 patients responded to this combination (+/- cisplatin) after failing to respond to the ifosfamide and carboplatin regimen. The ifosfamide and carboplatin combination may be considered for inclusion in non-cross-resistant alternating CT schedules. \nA simple method for biliary-enteric anastomosis and chronic bile diversion in the rat. A simple method of biliary-enteric anastomosis, without the use of surgical microscopy, is described. There were no signs of cholestasis after 3 mo of follow-up. A modified procedure using a silicone elastomer catheter as a stent for the biliary-enteric anastomosis resulted in biliary obstruction within 3 wk after surgery. Our experimental bile duct implantation technique is a simple and useful experimental method for the investigation of chronic biliary diversion and biliary physiology. Additionally, it can be performed safely and easily in a rodent model without sophisticated microscopic techniques. \nUnwashed filtered shed blood collected after knee and hip arthroplasties. A source of autologous red blood cells. We evaluated the results of twelve hematological and plasma protein determinations in 450 to 500-milliliter volumes of shed blood that had been collected with or without acid-citrate-dextrose anticoagulant (National Institutes of Health Formula A) from knees and hips during the first twelve hours after arthroplasty. We also evaluated the effects on the recipients when the blood was used for reinfusion. The findings in the units that had been obtained in less than four hours, in between four and six hours, and in more than six hours after the arthroplasty were similar whether or not the acid-citrate-dextrose anticoagulant had been used. The mean values for the collected units were: in the blood, a concentration of hemoglobin of 115 grams per liter, a hematocrit of 0.34, a white blood-cell count of 4.8 x 10(9) per liter, and a red blood-cell count of 3.7 x 10(12) per liter, and, in the plasma, a level of hemoglobin of 160 grams per liter, a level of fibrinogen of less than 0.2 gram per liter, a level of factor-V clotting protein of less than 10 per cent of normal, a level of factor-VIII clotting protein that was 45 per cent of normal, a level of antithrombin III that was 45 per cent of normal, a level of plasminogen that was 55 per cent of normal, a level of protein C that was 100 per cent of normal, and a level of fibrin-degradation products of 1000 micrograms per milliliter of plasma. The clinical response of the patient was assessed after the reinfusion of a total of 205 units of unwashed shed blood into 153 patients. In addition, in 126 of the 153 patients, hematological and plasma-protein measurements were analyzed before the autotransfusion and one and twenty-four hours afterward. Each of these patients had received one to four units of shed blood that had been filtered but not washed. Only two (2 per cent) of the ninety-nine patients who received shed blood that had been collected six hours or less after the operation had a febrile reaction, whereas twelve (22 per cent) of the fifty-four patients who received blood that had been collected six to twelve hours after the operation had such a reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nPercutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump: emphasis on complications. In a review of our 5-year experience with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) insertion I examined the complications of percutaneous IABP placement in 93 patients, and compared them with those reported in other studies in the literature. I analyzed several variables that may affect the complication rate. Of 78 patients in our series who had percutaneous IABP cardiac assist, 15 (19%) had complications, which falls into the acceptable range reported by others. Among 15 patients who had surgical placement of an IABP, the complication rate was similar at 20%. The complication rate after IABP insertions done by surgeons primarily in the operating room was compared with that from insertions done by cardiologists in the catheterization laboratory. The overall complication rate was found to be higher in the second group, 28.0% compared with 12.8%. The application of the IABP in cardiogenic shock was associated with a high complication rate (46%). On the other hand, its insertion before cardiac surgery was associated with a relatively low complication rate (9.5%). \nMotor inhibition from the brainstem is normal in torsion dystonia during REM sleep. The maintenance of axial atonia during REM sleep was monitored in 14 patients with primary torsion dystonia, 10 patients with secondary torsion dystonia, and 10 normal subjects using submental EMG and video EEG telemetry. The excitability of the corticospinal tract during REM sleep was also assessed using scalp magnetic stimulation in seven patients and three controls. During REM sleep dystonic patients had well maintained atonia evidenced by infrequent bursts of submental activity, no episodes of complex semi-purposeful behaviour and reduced motor responses to magnetic stimulation. These findings suggest that the inhibitory centres in the region of the locus coeruleus and their descending pathways to the spinal alpha motor neurons are intact in torsion dystonia. \nLateral parascapular extrapleural approach to the upper thoracic spine. The upper thoracic vertebrae are difficult to approach surgically because of the narrowing of the thoracic inlet, the proximity of the brachial plexus, and the parascapular shoulder musculature. A novel lateral parascapular extrapleural approach to the upper thoracic vertebrae is described. The parascapular shoulder musculature (trapezius, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles) is reflected off the spinous processes to the scapula as a musculocutaneous flap, preserving the neurovascular supply. The paraspinal musculature is mobilized and retracted, and the upper dorsal ribs are removed with caution to avoid injury to the C-8 and T-1 nerve roots. The rami communicantes are transected, and the sympathetic chain is displaced anterolaterally. The T2-4 vertebrae can be approached unobstructed. The T-1 nerve root obstructs posterolateral access to the T-1 vertebra, necessitating an inferolateral approach underneath the T-1 nerve root axilla. Four patients with compressive myelopathy from upper thoracic vertebral metastases underwent neural decompression, vertebral reconstruction, and posterior spinal fixation with this approach. Their postoperative neurological status was either unchanged or improved. Complications included radiographic pleural effusion and superficial wound dehiscence; one patient required posterior spinal reinstrumentation for progressive kyphosis. One patient developed pneumonia 7 days postoperatively which was unresponsive to appropriate treatment. It is believed that the anatomical limitations to this region have been overcome, and that excellent exposure of the T1-4 vertebrae for neural decompression and vertebral reconstruction can be performed safely. A major advantage is that posterior spinal fixation can be carried out simultaneously. \nDisulfiram implant: a double-blind placebo controlled follow-up on treatment outcome. Seventy-six alcohol-dependent patients participated in a study of the clinical effect of implanted disulfiram (DS). The patients were randomized to a DS group (n = 40), receiving a subcutaneous abdominal implantation of 10 x 100 mg DS tablets and a placebo group (PL group) receiving an implantation of 9 x 100 mg calcium phosphate tablets together with one calcium phosphate tablet containing 1 mg DS. Both groups believed they were receiving DS. At admission there was no significant difference between the DS and PL groups with regard to demographic characteristics, psychosocial adjustment, drinking variables, medical disorders, or laboratory results. After a study period of approximately 300 days, 63 patients (33 DS; 30 PL) were assessed using a battery of tests. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to reduction in average alcohol consumption, number of days to the first alcohol intake after implantation, or level of psychosocial function. Nevertheless, both groups reduced their ethanol consumption significantly, probably due to the psychological deterrent effect. The DS implant did result in a significantly higher incidence of wound complications. This study does not support the idea that a 1-g DS implant has any significant clinical effect different from the implant containing only 1 mg DS (placebo). \nEffect of cardiopulmonary support on regional and global left ventricular function during transient coronary occlusion. The ability of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support (CPS) to unload the left ventricle and reduce ischemic dysfunction during transient coronary occlusion was studied in 10 anesthetized dogs. Three serial 60-second circumflex coronary artery occlusions were performed with CPS initiated only during the second occlusion. CPS significantly reduced preocclusion systolic blood pressure, blood pressure x heart rate double-product, circumflex blood flow, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), peak negative dP/dt, and left ventricular systolic thickening. Circumflex occlusion caused changes in LVEDP and left ventricular wall thickening that were similar regardless of the presence or absence of CPS. These data suggest that CPS unloads the left ventricle during myocardial ischemia but does not prevent regional or global myocardial dysfunction. \nClinical features and results of therapy for children with paraspinal soft tissue sarcoma: a report of the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study. Soft tissue sarcomas of the paraspinal region comprised 3.3% (56 of 1,688) of the patients entered and eligible on Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies I (IRS-I) and II (IRS-II) (1972 to 1984). These lesions tended to be greater than 5 cm in diameter at diagnosis, invaded the spinal extradural space, and were of the extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma subtype in 55% (30 of 56) of the cases. Patients with tumors in clinical groups II, III, and IV were treated with radiotherapy (XRT) and vincristine-dactinomycin (VA) or VA plus cyclophosphamide (VAC) +/- doxorubicin. Clinical group I patients treated on IRS-II did not receive XRT, while those on IRS-I were randomized to receive VAC +/- XRT. Forty-four of the paraspinal patients (79%) achieved a complete response (CR) compared with 77% (1,260 of 1,632) for patients with disease in other sites. Twenty-seven patients (55%) subsequently relapsed (five local, three regional, four local and distant, and 14 distant). The proportion of patients surviving 5 years by clinical group (stage) from I to IV were 50%, 50%, 62%, and 27%, respectively. Paraspinal patients had somewhat poorer survival than patients with disease in other sites, both in IRS-I and IRS-II; the percentage of paraspinal patients surviving 5 years was 50% and 52% for IRS-I and IRS-II, respectively, whereas these percentages were 55% and 63% for patients with disease in other sites. Histology did not influence the CR rate, but unexpectedly, patients who had embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) had the poorest overall survival rate. We concluded that patients with paraspinal lesions may require extended-field radiation therapy to reduce the high local failure rate and more intensive chemotherapy to achieve better local and systemic tumor control. \nPacemaker failure on induction of anaesthesia. A patient with a permanent pacemaker presented for repair of a strangulated hernia. During induction of anaesthesia, the pacemaker generator stopped discharging, thus causing cardiac arrest. The likely cause of the generator failure was inhibition by suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations. Following defibrillation, and increase in stimulation threshold necessitated urgent insertion of a transvenous pacing system. It is suggested that, when suxamethonium is to be used in a patient with a permanent pacemaker, consideration should be given to reprogramming the pacemaker to asynchronous mode before induction of anaesthesia. If a patient with a pacemaker requires defibrillation, an acute increase in stimulation threshold may result and cause loss of capture. Rapid insertion of a transvenous pacing system may be necessary. \nEtiology of autism: genetic influences. In summary, there are a few specific genetic conditions that can be associated with autism. Among cases of unknown etiology, there is ample evidence for a higher genetic liability to autism in siblings of autistic probands than expected from the population prevalence. It appears likely that both parents and siblings have a higher liability for social and cognitive deficits that are milder but conceptually similar to those found in autism. Others factors may alter this underlying genetic liability such as sex, IQ, and prenatal and perinatal injury. In the future, genetic analyses and genetic linkage studies will need to consider using a broader definition of the autism phenotype to include not only autism but severe cognitive and social deficits. The exact genetic mechanisms and genes involved are the subject of current investigations by several research groups. Investigations in this area are likely to continue to provide important information about the causes of autism. \nRenovascular hypertension: predicting surgical cure with exercise renography. Renal artery stenosis with resultant renovascular hypertension has attracted clinical attention because the disease is potentially curable and because numerous diagnostic and therapeutic modalities compete for clinical acceptance. An exercise-mediated disturbance of renal hippurate transport was recently described, and has been implicated as having a role in nephrogenic fixed hypertension. To predict the final course of renovascular hypertension before operation we carried out a prospective study with the goal of verifying the predictive value of exercise hippurate scintigraphy. The study was to test the hypothesis that patients with disturbance of renal hippurate transport (pathologic renogram) induced by exercise would have stabilized hypertension and would continue to be hypertensive after operation. Thirty-one patients with hypertension who had unilateral or bilateral renovascular stenosis documented on angiography were referred to rest and exercise hippurate scintigrams before operation. The results of the examinations at rest served as standard and were compared with the exercise scintigrams. In 19 of the 31 (61%) patients a disturbance of transrenal hippurate transport evolved during exercise, whereas 12 (39%) patients failed to respond to exercise with altered hippurate kinetics. Twenty-six patients went on to renovascular operations; five had percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Revascularization results differed markedly when the blood pressure response of patients with positive results on exercise (abnormal) and patients with negative results on exercise (normal) were compared. Ten of 12 patients with hypertension who had normal exercise renograms were cured. In comparison, blood pressure values were little influenced by therapy in patients with an abnormal response, where 17 of 19 patients continued to have hypertensive disease after therapy. \nReport of the Council on Scientific Affairs: ultrasonic imaging of the heart: report of the Ultrasonography Task Force. The use of ultrasonography in cardiology has progressed so dramatically that not only is anatomic information available but information can also be derived about cardiac hemodynamics. Applications range from intravascular ultrasonic imaging of coronary atherosclerosis to predictions of the severity of fetal valvular pulmonic stenosis detected in utero. We reviewed cardiac ultrasonography as utilized in B-mode imaging, pulsed and continuous-wave spectral Doppler, and Doppler color flow mapping. We reviewed specialized areas, including stress echo for wall motion analysis, valvular and congenital heart disease applications, and new applications in intraoperative, transesophageal, contrast echography, coronary imaging, and fetal echocardiography. Finally, future applications of quantitative flow mapping and intraluminal and interventional ultrasonography were considered along with the required technological advances. \nUnproven methods of cancer management. Livingston-Wheeler therapy. Livingston-Wheeler's cancer treatment is based on the belief that cancer is caused by a bacterium she has named Progenitor cryptocides. Careful research using modern techniques, however, has shown that there is no such organism and that Livingston-Wheeler has apparently mistaken several different types of bacteria, both rare and common, for a unique microbe. In spite of diligent research to isolate a cancer-causing microorganism, none has been found. Similarly, Livingston-Wheeler's autologous vaccine cannot be considered an effective treatment for cancer. While many oncologists have expressed the hope that someday a vaccine will be developed against cancer, the cause(s) of cancer must be determined before research can be directed toward developing a vaccine. The rationale for other facets of the Livingston-Wheeler cancer therapy is similarly faulty. No evidence supports her contention that cancer results from a defective immune system, that a whole-foods diet restores immune system deficiencies, that abscisic acid slows tumor growth, or that cancer is transmitted to humans by chickens. \nTube feeding-related diarrhea in acutely Ill patients. Acutely ill patients received tube feeding for an average of 15.8 days and, on average, 35% of those days were spent in the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were prospectively assigned either a fiber-free formula (FFF-OSMOLITE HN, Ross; n = 50) or a fiber-supplemented (soy polysaccharide 14.4 g/L) formula (FSF = JEVITY, Ross; n = 50). Diarrhea was defined as three or more loose or watery stools per day and occurred in 30% of all patients. Diarrhea developed in 29 (41%) of the 71 patients who received antibiotics during, or within 2 weeks prior to, the feeding period, whereas only 1 (3%) of the 29 patients not receiving antibiotics developed diarrhea (p less than 0.005); and this patient developed diarrhea on the day of death. Among the 30 patients with diarrhea, stool Clostridium difficile (CD) toxin was positive in 15 (50%), negative in 11 (37%), and was not measured in four. The mean serum albumin was significantly lower in patients with diarrhea (2.43) than in those without diarrhea (2.75) (p = 0.043). There were no significant differences in age, sex, diagnoses, number of feeding days, and percent ICU days between patients with and without diarrhea. While not statistically significant, patients who received FSF were observed to have a lower incidence of diarrhea, a lower percentage of diarrhea days per total feeding days, and a lower frequency of positive CD toxin assays than patients who received FFF. In this patient population, antibiotic usage was the factor most strongly associated with diarrhea during tube feedings. \nFactors affecting decisions to institutionalize demented elderly. This study followed 321 community-based patients with documented dementias, 22% of whom were institutionalized after 1 year. Multivariate analyses indicated that none of the patient characteristics, such as level of cognitive, psychiatric, or neurological impairment, predicted institutionalization. Social psychological characteristics, type and number of caregivers, and subjective caregiver distress did predict which patients were ultimately institutionalized. Implications for treatment planning are discussed. \nLow back pain: review of diagnosis and therapy. Low back pain is a patient complaint frequently encountered in the emergency department setting. The disease entity is often a diagnostic challenge with a subtle presentation, but can be accompanied by significant neurovascular complications. Current topics of controversy include the utility of radiologic evaluation, pharmacologic and holistic treatment strategies, as well as guidelines for urgent referral of patients with lumbar pain. \nHyperfractionated radiation therapy in brain stem tumors. Results of treatment at the 7020 cGy dose level of Pediatric Oncology Group study #8495. Between May 1986 and February 1988, 57 patients were accrued to the second dose level of a Phase I/II Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) study exploring the use of hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HRT) in children with high-risk brain stem tumors. Local fields were treated with fraction sizes of 117 cGy given twice daily, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, to a total dose of 7020 cGy in 60 fractions over 6 weeks. Information regarding clinical status during HRT was available for 55 patients (44 [80%] improved, 6 remained stable, and 5 deteriorated). Results of initial and follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were available for review for 52 patients. One patient had a complete response (CR) to treatment, 3 had a partial response (PR) (more than 50% response), and 40 remained stable, for a total response rate (CR + PR + stable) of 77%. Median time to disease progression was 6 months. Median survival time was 10 months. Survival rate was 39.6% (standard error [SE] = 6.6%) at 1 year and 23% (SE = 5.8%) at 2 years. Complications of treatment included an enhanced skin reaction in six patients and otitis media and/or externa in nine. One patient bled into tumor shortly after completion of HRT, and three had intralesional necrosis. Five patients continued taking steroids for protracted periods in the face of improved clinical and/or radiologic findings. Complications related to the use of steroids included opportunistic infections, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, osteoporosis, and significant mood changes. In no patient was there evidence of any late injury attributable to HRT. When compared with results of treatment with HRT at a lower dose level (6600 cGy), there appears to be a trend toward improved survival at 7020 cGy despite a less favorable patient population at the higher dose level. A second dose escalation to 7560 cGy in 60 fractions over 6 weeks has been implemented as planned. \nSleep apnea in acromegaly. OBJECTIVE: To provide information on the nature, prevalence, and severity of sleep apnea in patients with acromegaly. DESIGN: Consecutive case series. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients with acromegaly were consecutively referred: 33 patients were referred because of clinical suspicion of sleep apnea and 20 patients were referred without suspected apnea. MEASUREMENTS: Sleep studies as well as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) measurements were done. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (93%; 95% Cl, 85% to 100%) referred because of suspicion of sleep apnea had sleep apnea compared with 12 patients (60%; Cl, 37% to 83%) referred without suspected sleep apnea. Patients with sleep apnea did not have biochemical evidence of increased disease activity (random growth hormone, 12.7 +/- 4.4 micrograms/L; mean growth hormone at 24-hour sampling, 10.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/L; IGF-1, 90.0 +/- 7.5 nmol/L) compared with patients without sleep apnea (random growth hormone, 14.2 +/- 4.9 micrograms/L, P greater than 0.2; mean growth hormone, 12.4 +/- 3.5 micrograms/L, P greater than 0.2; IGF-1, 90.0 +/- 10.0 nmol/L, P greater than 0.2). Central sleep apnea was the predominant type of apnea in 33% (Cl, 18% to 47%) of patients and was associated with higher random growth hormone and IGF-1 levels than was obstructive apnea (random growth hormone, 23.4 +/- 3.9 compared with 8.8 +/- 3.1 micrograms/L, P less than 0.001; IGF-1, 126 +/- 17.5 compared with 72.5 +/- 7.5 nmol/L, P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep apnea is common in acromegaly. The rate of central sleep apnea was unexpectedly high in patients with acromegaly, and biochemical evidence of increased disease activity was associated with the presence of central apnea rather than with the degree of sleep apnea. Altered respiratory control is a possible mechanism producing sleep apnea in acromegaly. \nAortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in persons aged 80 years and over. Seventy-one patients aged greater than or equal to 80 years (mean +/- standard deviation 82 +/- 2) with aortic stenosis or mixed stenosis and regurgitation underwent aortic valve replacement alone (n = 35, group 1) or in combination with a coronary artery bypass procedure without any other valve procedure (n = 36, group 2). Preoperatively, 91% had severe cardiac limitations (New York Heart Association class III or IV). Hospital mortality was 12.7% overall (9 of 71), 5.7% (2 of 35) for group 1 and 19.4% (7 of 36) for group 2. Perioperatively, 1 patient (1.4%) had a stroke. Survival from late cardiac death at 1 and 3 years was 98.2 and 95.5%, respectively, for all patients, 100% for patients who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement, and 96.3 and 91.2%, respectively, for patients who underwent aortic valve replacement plus coronary artery bypass. Eighty-three percent of surviving patients had marked symptomatic improvement. Freedom from all valve-related complications (thromboembolism, anticoagulant, endocarditis, reoperation or prosthetic failure) was 93.3 and 80.4% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Thus, short- and long-term morbidity and mortality after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in patients aged greater than or equal to 80 years are encouragingly low, although the addition of coronary artery bypass grafting increases short- and long-term mortality. \nRecognizing and naming tunes: memory impairment in the elderly. Subjects over the age of 50 listened to theme tunes of remote, recent, and frequent television programs. If they recognized the tune, they were asked for the name of the program and for as much information about the program as possible. From the responses to a subsequent questionnaire, it was possible to divide the data according to whether or not the subjects watched the programs. There was no effect of age on the recognition and naming of programs subjects never watched. For programs they watched (a true test of memory), older subjects recognized fewer tunes as familiar and were less able than younger subjects to name the programs with familiar tunes. Neither the amount of exposure nor the delay since exposure had a significant influence on the recognition and naming impairments with age. Older subjects reported less information about programs they watched than younger subjects. In multiple regression analyses, age was a better predictor of performance than measures of current cognitive ability. The results are compared with the effects of age on the recognition and naming of famous faces (Maylor, 1990a). It is argued that the studies together support the view that the information processing rate decreases with age; therefore the elderly are poor at speeded tasks, the most dramatic effects appearing for later components of sequential processes. \nLate cardiac tamponade after open-heart surgery. Late cardiac tamponade occurred in 74 patients 5-287 (median 16) days after open-heart surgery and was treated with pericardiocentesis or surgery. The overall incidence of late cardiac tamponade was 1.3%. After valve operations it was 2.6% and after isolated coronary surgery 0.7% (53/2,028 vs. 18/2,661, p less than 0.002). The diagnosis was assessed by echocardiography in 93% of cases. Pericardiocentesis, attempted in 65 cases (88%), was curative in 80% but failed in 20%. Eight of the latter 13 underwent emergency surgery and five were medically treated. Failure of pericardiocentesis was associated with posterior location of fluid, clots, echo-free space less than 20 mm or myocardial insufficiency. The subxiphoid part of the wound was surgically re-entered in ten cases and the entire sternotomy in seven. Four patients (5%) died within 30 days of the primary intervention. All hospital survivors were observed for a median of 44 (range 11-115) months. Three (4%) had recurrent pericardial effusion requiring repeat pericardiocentesis, but none had pericardial constriction. The 5-year survival rate was 73%. \nManometric and radiologic investigations and biofeedback treatment of chronic idiopathic anal pain. In 12 patients suffering from chronic idiopathic anal pain, the rectosphincteric function was studied using manometric and x-ray techniques. The results of manometric investigations were compared with those obtained in 12 healthy volunteers. In all patients, the resting pressure in the anal canal was significantly higher than in control subjects. In 10 patients, defecography revealed abnormalities of the pelvic muscles. We treated the patients by using biofeedback techniques, consisting of voluntary modifications of the state of contraction of the external sphincter. In all cases, pain disappeared after a mean of eight biofeedback training sessions. When noxious manifestations had disappeared, manometry showed a significant decrease in the anal canal resting pressure. Our results indicate 1) that chronic idiopathic anal pain is associated with abnormal anorectal manometric profiles, probably resulting from a dysfunctioning of the striated external anal sphincter, and 2) that biofeedback training is an effective treatment for chronic idiopathic anal pain. \nIn vitro balloon dilatation of mitral valve stenosis: the importance of subvalvar involvement as a cause of mitral valve insufficiency. To investigate the mechanism that increases the orifice area of the mitral valve during balloon dilatation 43 surgically excised intact rheumatic mitral valves were studied. The main pathological features were (a) fibrosis of mitral valve leaflets and commissures (10 valves); (b) fibrosis with calcification of one commissure (eight anterolateral, seven posteromedial); (c) fibrosis with calcification of both commissures (seven valves); and (d) predominant involvement of the subvalvar apparatus (11 valves). The valves were assessed by photography and radiography before and after balloon dilatation (balloons up to 38 mm (bifoil 2 x 19 mm) and pressures up to 4 atmospheres). The valve was dilated in stages under direct visual control by balloons of increasing diameter. Splitting of the fused commissures was the most common mode of widening the orifice. However, the mitral valve leaflets were torn in two fibrotic valves and in six valves with extensive involvement of the subvalvar apparatus. In the fibrotic valves (group (a] the tear originated near the valve perimeter, at the thinnest part of the remaining valve leaflet. In the valves with subvalvar involvement splitting started at the apex of spaces between the fused chordal columns and proceeded upward. Where there is extensive involvement of the subvalvar apparatus in rheumatic mitral valve disease the risk of tearing of the valve leaflets by balloon dilatation is increased and this is likely to predispose to the development of acute valvar insufficiency. \nComparison of sucralfate and ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcers. Ninety patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcers, enrolled in this prospective, single-blind study, were randomized to sucralfate, 1 g q.i.d., 0.5 hour before meals on an empty stomach or at bedtime, or ranitidine, 150 mg b.i.d., for 4-8 weeks (phase I). Patients who healed during the treatment period were invited to participate in a maintenance therapy follow-up covering 1 year (phase II), during which they were treated with sucralfate, 1 g b.i.d. (before breakfast and at bedtime) or 150 mg of ranitidine at bedtime. After 4 weeks of treatment, healing rates were 30/40 (75.0%) with sucralfate and 36/42 (85.7%) with ranitidine, and healing rates were 39/40 (97.6%) and 40/42 (95.2%) respectively, after 8 weeks of treatment. At the end of the 6th and 12th months of phase II, respectively, relapse rates were 3/33 (9.4%) and 10/32 (31.3%) in the sucralfate group and 5/33 (15.2%) and 10/29 (34.5%) in the ranitidine group. Differences between sucralfate- and ranitidine-treated groups were not significant. Both treatments were well tolerated. We conclude that sucralfate is as effective and safe as ranitidine in the short-term treatment and prevention of relapse in patients with ulcer disease. \nHepatocarcinoma in cirrhosis. Is antithrombin III a neoplastic marker? It has been reported that hepatoma (HCC) cells produce abnormal proteins such as erytropietin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, and, recently, antithrombin III (AT III). In a preliminary report, we reported increased AT III levels in patients bearing HCC independent of their clinical liver status. The present study was performed to assess antithrombin III levels and other serological data present in patients with cirrhosis and in patients with cirrhosis and clinical findings of neoplastic disease. In 70 well-matched patients (47 with cirrhosis and 23 with cirrhosis and proven HCC) serum total cholesterol, albumin, prothrombin, alkaline phosphatase, AFP, aminotransferases, and AT III were determined. Together with AFP and alkaline phosphatase, patients with HCC had higher values of AT III (88 +/- 7%) and total cholesterol (184 +/- 17 mg/100 ml), as compared with cirrhotic patients (AT III 56 +/- 3.6%; total cholesterol 113 +/- 5 mg/100 ml) (P less than 0.001). No difference was observed between these two groups for albumin, prothrombin, and aminotransferases. In HCC patients, AT III levels were related to the total cholesterol level (R2 = 0.317), whereas in the cirrhotic patients it correlated with the prothrombin level (R2 = 0.274). These data suggest that in HCC patients a greater rate of synthesis of AT III occurs, whereas in cirrhotic patients lower levels of AT III occur due to impaired synthesis or increased catabolism of the protein. The serial determination of AT III in cirrhotic patients as a means of detecting neoplastic transformation is suggested. \nScintigraphic studies of inflammation in diffuse lung disease. 67Ga lung scintigraphy is an established means to assess alveolar inflammation in a wide variety of diffuse lung diseases. It can be used to monitor the extent and activity of the alveolitis during the course of the disease and as a follow-up evaluation to therapy. Although the mechanism of 67Ga localization is not established firmly, the isotope appears to act as a tracer for disturbed protein and cellular fluxes within the interstitium and alveolar spaces. The radiolabeled aerosol study may also be applied to the study of these fluxes as a reflection of inflammation and injury. Although Tc-DTPA clearance studies are highly sensitive to lung injury, they may be too nonspecific to separate lung injury from other physiologic processes effectively. \nEffect of dobutamine on oxygen consumption and fluid and protein losses after endotoxemia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a dobutamine infusion on the relationship between oxygen consumption (VO2) and oxygen delivery (DO2) after endotoxin administration, as well as the rate of fluid and protein loss from permeability-injured tissue. METHODS: Unanesthetized adult sheep with lung and soft-tissue lymph fistulas were given 5 micrograms/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin alone, or E. coli endotoxin plus a continuous infusion of dobutamine (10 to 15 micrograms/kg.min) beginning at 3 hrs. Lymph flow reflected the vascular permeability and surface area perfused. Data were compared with dobutamine alone and with controls. Filling pressures were maintained at baseline. RESULTS: Dobutamine alone produced a 75% increase in DO2, a transient 10 +/- 4% increase in VO2, but no increase in lung or soft-tissue lymph flow. Beginning at 3 hrs after endotoxin alone, a significant increase in protein-rich lung and soft-tissue lymph flow was noted, but only a transient 14 +/- 5% increase in VO2. Plasma proteins were slightly decreased. With the addition of dobutamine at 3 hrs postendotoxin, DO2 increased by greater than 50% for the 3-hr infusion period, while VO2 increased for a 30-min period by 25 +/- 8%, which was not different than endotoxin alone. Lung and soft-tissue lymph flow did not increase further, but plasma proteins did decrease significantly compared with controls and with endotoxin alone. CONCLUSION: Increasing DO2 with dobutamine postendotoxin does not increase the surface area perfused or the edema process, at least in lung and soft tissue. Therefore, no microvessels in these tissues are reopened with dobutamine when normal filling pressures are present. Dobutamine administration does not increase VO2 more than the increase seen with endotoxin alone. \nIschaemic spinal cord lesion following percutaneous radiofrequency spinal rhizotomy. Two patients are presented in whom percutaneous radiofrequency spinal rhizotomy was complicated by contralateral paresis. Both patients were elderly and suffered from cardiac failure, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, and generalized vascular disease. Investigation of the paresis indicated a contralateral ischaemic cord lesion. It is suggested that local haemodynamic changes induced by heat-mediated rhizotomy may compromise oxygen delivery to the adjacent cord, especially in the presence of pre-existent cardiovascular disease. \nAdvances in pediatric emergency department procedures. Pediatric procedures in the Emergency Department typically involve techniques for stabilization, evaluation, and treatment of the child. This article considers indications and techniques for vascular access, lumbar puncture, arterial lines, pulse oximetry, and urine collection. Multiple routes of medication administration and pain management modalities also are reviewed. \nYersinia enterocolitica infection with ileal perforation associated with iron overload and deferoxamine therapy. Despite the frequency of gastrointestinal disease caused by Yersinia enterocolitica, intestinal perforation is a rare complication of this infection and to date only eight cases have been reported in the English literature. We describe a case of this unusual condition in a 17-year-old male patient with thalassemia intermedia requiring transfusion, who was also taking deferoxamine. The severity of the clinical picture is probably due to the increased virulence of Yersinia enterocolitica in the presence of deferoxamine and iron. \nIncreased all-cause and cardiac morbidity and mortality associated with the diagonal earlobe crease: a prospective cohort study. PURPOSE: To ascertain whether the diagonal earlobe crease (ELC) is associated prospectively with future death or cardiac events over 8 years of follow-up in two sets of patients: those with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and those without evidence for CAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study of 108 patients in four cohorts (each matched for age, sex, and race, but differing in the presence or absence of both a diagonal ELC and CAD in 1979 to 1982). Follow-up information was gathered by telephone interviews, and dates and causes of death were determined by reference to death certificates (n = 48), hospital records (n = 9), or attending physician statements (n = 1). RESULTS: During 8 to 10 years of follow-up, 58 of the patients had died. Patients with ELCs had poorer survival rates than those without creases, by stratified log-rank test (p = 0.006 for the cohorts thought not to have CAD, and p = 0.058 for those with CAD). Cardiac death rates (due to acute myocardial infarction, \"sudden cardiac death,\" or heart failure) were also higher for patients with ELCs: 8.0 versus 0.9 cardiac deaths per 100 patient-years (p less than 0.001) in patients without CAD at entry, and 11.7 versus 3.7 cardiac deaths per 100 patient-years (p = 0.008) in patients with CAD in 1979 to 1982. Cardiac event rates (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or coronary artery bypass surgery) were also higher in those with ELCs: 10.4 versus 1.4 events per 100 patient-years (p less than 0.001) for those without known CAD, and 15.8 versus 5.7 events per 100 patient-years (p = 0.009) for those with CAD. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a diagonal ELC is associated with increased all-cause and cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with ELCs may be at higher risk for coronary events, and might be especially cautioned to control or reduce other cardiac risk factors, even if currently without diagnostic evidence of CAD. \nGoiter and hypothyroidism during re-treatment with amiodarone in a patient who previously experienced amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. A 55-year-old woman who had been receiving treatment with amiodarone for recurrent supraventricular tachyarrhythmias became thyrotoxic after 30 months of treatment. The thyroid gland was not enlarged or tender. Amiodarone was discontinued, and thyrotoxicosis gradually abated. A thyroid scan performed at that time revealed a gland of normal size and texture. Six months later, amiodarone treatment was reinstated due to life-threatening tachyarrhythmia; however, the patient remained euthyroid. Three years later, multinodular goiter began to develop, and 5 years after that, the patient became hypothyroid. Tests for thyroid autoantibodies, as well as inhibitory and stimulatory antibodies, were negative, and fine needle aspiration biopsy revealed an adenomatous goiter. Treatment with amiodarone was continued; however, therapy with L-thyroxin was initiated, followed by a complete regression of the goiter. The patient has since required a maintenance dose of L-thyroxin. The possible mechanisms by which iodine-containing drugs induce thyroid disfunction are reviewed, suggesting this case was caused by an alteration in the sensitivity of the intrinsic autoregulation of the thyroid gland to iodine. \nMaintenance therapy in peptic ulcer disease. The maxim \"once an ulcer, always an ulcer\" is still an appropriate description for the chronic nature of peptic ulcer disease. The goals for treating patients with ulcer disease are to relieve symptoms, heal the acute ulcer, reduce the risk of ulcer recurrence and complications, and decrease the economic impact of this chronic disease while maintaining the patient's quality of life. Patients with documented peptic ulcer disease should be carefully evaluated and a treatment plan devised that takes into account the possible need for maintenance therapy. Risk factors that seem to reflect a high likelihood of ulcer recurrence should be identified early in all ulcer patients and attempts made to minimize or correct them in the future. Assuming that a diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease has been firmly established and an adequate period of drug treatment makes complete ulcer healing likely, a reasonable way to proceed is outlined in Figure 4. If the patient is young and generally healthy, has an uncomplicated ulcer and few risk factors favoring ulcer relapse, either no treatment or symptomatic selfcare would be reasonable. If one chooses the latter course, the patient can be given a prescription for 3 to 6 months of medication and told to take full therapy for any recurrent symptoms, continuing the treatment until symptoms are relieved. The failure of such treatment to relieve symptoms after 2 to 3 weeks, the onset of alarming symptoms such as intense pain, vomiting, or melena, or possibly the exhaustion of the 6-month supply of medication with continued mild symptoms should lead to reevaluation. Alternatively, such a patient could be managed with no therapy and seen again if ulcer symptoms recur and reevaluated for further diagnosis and treatment. Obviously, patients who are candidates for these approaches to postulcer healing management are those with a low risk for ulcer recurrence and who are likely to be compliant with follow-up advice. Accordingly, careful patient selection seems most important in prescribing symptomatic self-care or intermittent full-dose maintenance treatment. On the other hand, if the patient has had a complicated course of ulcer disease, such as bleeding, or has a significant number of risk factors that would make early ulcer relapse highly likely, it would be prudent to institute continuous maintenance therapy while working to reduce or eliminate the adverse risk factors. Any relapse of symptomatic ulcer disease during noncontinuous maintenance therapy should indicate the need for return to a continuous dosing program.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \nThe role of leukotriene antagonists and inhibitors in the treatment of airway disease. Since the early recognition that leukotrienes are generated in response to allergen exposure, a role for these multipurpose mediators has been sought. The pharmacologic actions of the leukotrienes and their cell sources were strong evidence that they should contribute to allergic airway disease. That promise is now being fulfilled. Potent leukotriene receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors of leukotriene generation are now being investigated. With the availability of these new compounds, not only will greater insight to leukotrienes in asthma become apparent, but possibly newer, more effective therapeutics. Of additional interest and relevance is the potential role of leukotrienes in other nonrespiratory inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. Therefore, the role of leukotrienes in inflammation is not limited to the respiratory system but are more universal in their ability to cause tissue injury. Consequently, studies that have shown benefit from inhibition of leukotriene synthesis and antagonism of the LTD4 receptor in respiratory diseases are suggestive that such an approach will also be beneficial in other inflammatory diseases. For example, a study of 72 patients with A-64077 (zileuton) has demonstrated that 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors are efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, the contribution of leukotrienes to inflammation is likely to be a global phenomenon, and the introduction of leukotriene antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors may represent the beginning of a new era for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases. \nWaterborne outbreak of Norwalk virus gastroenteritis at a southwest US resort: role of geological formations in contamination of well water. From April 17 to May 1, 1989, gastroenteritis developed in about 900 people during a visit to a new resort in Arizona, USA. Of 240 guests surveyed, 110 had a gastrointestinal illness that was significantly associated with the drinking of tap water from the resort's well (relative risk = 16.1, 95% confidence interval 14.5 to 17.8) and this risk increased significantly with the number of glasses of water consumed (p less than 0.005). Three of seven paired sera tested for antibodies to the Norwalk agent had a four-fold or greater rise in titre. Water contaminated with faecal coliforms was traced back to the deep water well, which remained contaminated even after prolonged pumping. Effluent from the resort's sewage treatment facility seeped through fractures in the subsurface rock (with little filtration) directly into the resort's deep well. Although the latest technology was used to design the resort's water and sewage treatment plants, the region's unique geological conditions posed unexpected problems that may trouble developers faced with similar subsurface geological formations and arid climatic conditions in many parts of the world. In these areas, novel solutions are needed to provide adequate facilities for the treatment of sewage and supply of pure drinking water. \nProspective hospital based study on persistent diarrhoea. A total of 383 children aged less than 5 years suffering from acute watery diarrhoea or dysentery were studied in hospital to determine the rate of persistent diarrhoea. Altogether 335 (87.5%) recovered within 13 days. Only in 48 (12.5%) did the diarrhoea continue for 14 days or more, and they were considered as having persistent diarrhoea. Children aged between 7 and 18 months had a significantly increased incidence of persistent diarrhoea. Children suffering from grade II-IV malnutrition constituted the majority (70.8%) of those with persistent diarrhoea. Higher rates of isolation of Shigella flexneri, Shigella dysenteriae 1, and Salmonella typhimurium were observed among patients with persistent diarrhoea than in those with diarrhoea of shorter duration. No positive correlations were observed between the clinical severity of disease at hospital admission and measles. Breast fed babies were not prone to persistent diarrhoea. \nAntihypertensive drug use. Trends in the United States from 1973 to 1985. Hypertension, a major public health problem, often requires drug therapy. We examined trends in outpatient antihypertensive drug use in the United States from 1973 to 1985. The numbers of prescriptions and the diagnostic and drug treatment information were obtained from the National Prescription Audit (Ambler, Pa, IMS America, 1985) the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (Ambler, Pa, IMS America, 1985), ongoing surveys of pharmacies, and office-based physicians. We adjusted drug-use data for the fact that several antihypertensive drugs also have other uses. During the study period, the annual numbers of prescriptions for treatment of hypertension progressively increased from 128.1 to 208.6 million, an average change of 5% per year. In 1973, the three leading classes of antihypertensive drugs were thiazide diuretic agents, peripheral neuronal inhibitors, and central alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulators. By 1985, the thiazide drugs were still the leader, followed by beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and potassium-sparing diuretic drugs. The use trends presented are consistent with surveys indicating increased drug therapy of hypertension from 1960 to the present. \nCerebral akinetopsia (visual motion blindness). A review. Cerebral akinetopsia is a syndrome in which a patient loses specifically the ability to perceive visual motion following cortical lesions outside the striate cortex. There has been only one good case of akinetopsia in the published literature. Yet that case was immediately accepted by the neurological world. In this, cerebral akinetopsia differs markedly from cerebral achromatopsia, the evidence for which was strongly contested for the better part of a century (Zeki, 1990). This article complements the one on cerebral achromatopsia, traces the history of akinetopsia and enquires into why it was so much more readily acceptable than achromatopsia. \nLow-dose cyclopenthiazide in the treatment of hypertension: a one-year community-based study. After an 8-week placebo period, 73 patients whose diastolic blood pressures were between 90 and 110 mmHg were randomly assigned to receive 125 micrograms (low dose) or 500 micrograms of cyclopenthiazide (standard dose) for a period of one year. Blood pressure was measured in the patient's home by the same observer at two-weekly intervals during an 8-week placebo run-in period, every 4 weeks for a further 12 weeks and at 24, 36 and 52 weeks thereafter. Serum potassium, urate, glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, total and HDL cholesterol, and apolipoproteins were measured at the end of the placebo period and at 4, 8, 24 and 52 weeks of active treatment. Twelve of the 73 patients had an inadequate antihypertensive response--five on the higher dose and seven on the lower dose. One patient receiving 500 micrograms was withdrawn because of adverse effects. In the remaining 60 patients, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced when compared with pretreatment values in both treatment groups throughout the one year period. The decreases in blood pressure were not significantly different from each other (p greater than 0.65). Three patients on 500 micrograms required potassium supplements. Maximum decreases in the serum potassium of 0.52 mmol/l (500 micrograms dose) and 0.14 mmol/l (125 micrograms dose) were observed at 24 weeks of treatment in the remaining 57 patients. The differences between the two doses at this time were statistically significant (p less than 0.05), as were the increases in serum urate observed at 4, 8 and 24 weeks (p less than 0.05). \nOssified mucin-secreting choroid plexus adenoma: case report. This is the first report of a fully documented case of an ossified mucin-producing benign choroid plexus tumor. This was a chance finding in a man who complained only of posttraumatic low back discomfort. The ossification of the tumor appears to have been therapeutic. Mucin production may be a defense mechanism. \nAndroscopy for anogenital HPV BACKGROUND. Strong evidence now links anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia to the transmission of the human papillomavirus (HPV) through sexual intercourse. While there is increasing research on women with this disease, less is known about their male sexual partners. METHODS. Male patients whose female sexual partners had been diagnosed as having anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia were recruited for the study. The genital regions of the male patients were examined and biopsied with the aid of a colposcope after application of a 5% acetic acid solution. Treatment was based on the specific findings in each patient. RESULTS. Genital lesions were found on 65% of the male patients examined, even though no disease had been detected by the individual. Seventy-nine percent of patients who were compliant with the prescribed treatment protocol had no detectable HPV-related lesions at the time of their last androscopic examination. CONCLUSIONS. Magnified examination of the male genitalia using an androscope following the application of 5% acetic acid solution is an effective method by which the primary care physician can detect and treat male HPV-related anogenital lesions. \nAn animal model for colon cancer metastatic cell line with enhanced metastasizing ability. Establishment and characterization. We have developed an animal model for colon cancer metastasis and produced a metastasizing tumor after using a microinjection technique to inject SW480 cells into the cecal wall of athymic nude mice during \"minilaparotomy.\" After the metastatic foci formed in murine lung, an in vitro primary culture was performed and a new metastatic cancer cell line, which was designated as CC-ML3, was established. The studies included: 1) the comparison between SW 480 and CC-ML3 in morphology, growth kinetics, seeding and plating efficiency, and karyotype; and 2) carcino-embryonic antigen determination, origination, and metastatic ability of CC-ML3. The results showed that CC-ML3 was significantly different from SW480 in vitro and possessed a high metastatic potential in vivo. This newly developed animal model may thus be useful for studying the biology and pathogenesis of metastasis of human colonic cancer. \nIntravascular ultrasound guidance for catheter-based coronary interventions. Intravascular ultrasound is a new method for visualizing the details of vascular pathology, providing high resolution images of plaque and thrombus. This review summarizes the potential applications of ultrasound imaging in the guidance of balloon angioplasty, atherectomy, laser ablation and stenting. Ultrasound differs from angiography and angioscopy in its ability to penetrate below the surface of the vessel lumen, demonstrating specific aspects about the distribution and composition of plaque. Because the different layers of the arterial wall have different acoustic properties, ultrasound catheters are able to define the layers of normal wall in comparison with plaque. Particularly in combination with therapeutic techniques designed to remove or ablate plaque, ultrasound may prove useful in maximizing the amount of plaque treated and minimizing trauma to normal vessel wall components. Combined imaging/therapeutic devices are in the pilot phase of development and show promise for enhancing the safety and efficacy of the catheter devices. \nClinical experience with the Palmaz-Schatz coronary stent. Complications that occurred in 247 patients who underwent successful elective stenting to native coronary arteries with the Palmaz-Schatz balloon expandable stent included subacute thrombosis in 7 patients (2.8%), myocardial infarction in 3 (1.2%), death 3 (1.2%), urgent bypass surgery in 4 (1.6%) and major bleeding events in 24 (9.7%). Angiographic restenosis occurred in 21 (20%) of 103 patients who received a single stent. Subgroup analysis, however, revealed that restenosis of a single stent occurred in 3 (7%) of 45 patients without prior angioplasty compared with 25 (27%) of 91 patients with prior angioplasty. Patients with \"suboptimal\" angioplasty results (dis-section) who received a single stent seemed to have a higher thrombosis rate perioperatively (4 [4%] of 98), but no higher incidence of restenosis (7 [15%] of 46) than that of the total group of patients who received a single stent. Coronary stenting may be a valuable adjunct to coronary angioplasty in carefully selected patients. Complication rates are similar to those of routine angioplasty; however, angiographic restenosis may be reduced in certain subsets of patients. \nPulmonary hypertension associated with long-standing thrombocytosis. A case of thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension associated with long-standing thrombocytosis is presented. In this patient we found a significant local pulmonary platelet activation and thrombin generation as indicated by the existence of a transpulmonary gradient for thromboxane A2, beta thromboglobulin and fibrinopeptide A. Prolonged heparin and acetylsalicylic acid treatment resulted in improvement of clinical and hemodynamic conditions. These findings support the usefulness of anticoagulating and antiaggregating therapy in selected cases of pulmonary hypertension. \nTargeting cancer chemotherapeutic agents by use of lipiodol contrast medium. Arterially administered Lipiodol Ultrafluid contrast medium selectively remained in various malignant solid tumors because of the difference in time required for the removal of Lipiodol contrast medium from normal capillaries and tumor neovasculature. Although blood flow was maintained in the tumor, even immediately after injection Lipiodol contrast medium remained in the neovasculature of the tumor. To target anti-cancer agents to tumors by using Lipiodol contrast medium as a carrier, the characteristics of the agents were examined. Anti-cancer agents had to be soluble in Lipiodol, be stable in it, and separate gradually from it so that the anti-cancer agents would selectively remain in the tumor. These conditions were found to be necessary on the basis of the measurement of radioactivity in VX2 tumors implanted in the liver of 16 rabbits that received arterial injections of 14C-labeled doxorubicin. Antitumor activities and side effects of arterial injections of two types of anti-cancer agents were compared in 76 rabbits with VX2 tumors. Oily anti-cancer agents that had characteristics essential for targeting were compared with simple mixtures of anti-cancer agents with Lipiodol contrast medium that did not have these essential characteristics. Groups of rabbits that received oily anti-cancer agents responded significantly better than groups that received simple mixtures, and side effects were observed more frequently in the groups that received the simple mixtures. These results suggest that targeting of the anti-cancer agent to the tumor is important for treatment of solid malignant tumors. \nAntithrombin III supplementation reduces heparin requirement and platelet loss during hemodialysis of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Previous studies have shown that antithrombin III levels are low in fulminant hepatic failure, and heparin kinetics are abnormal, making control of heparinization difficult during hemodialysis of these patients who are at risk of bleeding. In this study, we have performed a controlled, randomized trial of antithrombin III supplementation on heparin activity, occurrence of bleeding and the platelet count and activation during hemodialysis in 24 patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The treated group of 12 patients was given 3,000 units of antithrombin III before hemodialysis. Antithrombin III supplementation was shown to normalize antithrombin III levels during hemodialysis (prelevels: 0.22 +/- 0.03 U/ml S.E.; at 1 hr 0.99 +/- 0.06 U/ml; p less than 0.001; control prelevels: 0.24 +/- 0.03 U/ml; at 1 hr 0.23 +/- 0.04 U/ml). Total heparin usage was significantly decreased by antithrombin III supplementation (median 5,200 U; range = 2,000 to 13,000) as compared with the control group (median 10,200 U; range = 5,000 to 16,500; p less than 0.005). Blood heparin level (antifactor Xa activity) after the initial bolus was significantly greater in the antithrombin III-supplemented subjects (0.40 +/- 0.07 U/ml compared with 0.22 +/- 0.05 U/ml in the control group; p less than 0.05). The significant reduction in platelet count observed in the control patients (18% +/- 6% at 1 hr; p less than 0.05) did not occur in antithrombin III patients (6% +/- 4% at 1 hr), which was reflected by a lower release of the platelet-specific protein beta-thromboglobulin. Two of 12 patients in both groups showed minor bleeding around vascular access sites during the first hemodialysis. \nPrevalence and malignant potential of colorectal polyps in asymptomatic, average-risk men. Screening colonoscopy was performed on 119 asymptomatic elderly men with no other risk factors for colonic neoplasms. Ninety adenomas were detected in 49 (41%) subjects. Mean adenoma size was 6.5 mm, with 83 (92%) less than or equal to 10 mm. Forty-nine (54%) adenomas were located proximal to the splenic flexure, and 17 (19%) were classified as tubulovillous or villous. Moderate- to high-grade dysplasia was found in 29 (32%) adenomas and was associated with larger size (p less than 0.0001) and villous architecture (p = 0.0038). Two subjects harbored adenomas with invasive cancer. Seventy-one hyperplastic polyps were found in 40 (34%) subjects. The mean size of hyperplastic polyps was 3.4 mm, and 64 (90%) were located in the left colon. We conclude that, in this population, adenomas are common lesions that are frequently small. However, substantial proportions of these adenomas may be at risk for malignant degeneration due to the presence of villous architecture and higher grades of dysplasia. Because adenomas and hyperplastic polyps are endoscopically indistinguishable, all polyps found at endoscopy should be removed or ablated. \nConditions not attributable to a mental disorder: an epidemiological study of family problems. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to identify and measure the differences among three groups of psychiatric outpatients: those with family problems but without mental disorders, those with both family problems and mental disorders, and those with a mental disorder but without family problems. DSM-III V code conditions (conditions not attributable to a mental disorder) other than family problems do occur, but family problems were chosen because of their importance. METHOD: All patients admitted to an outpatient psychiatric clinic during a 2-year period were studied (N = 382). Of these, 92 had V code conditions unrelated to family problems and were excluded. Data are presented on the remaining 290 patients. Sociodemographic variables, DSM-III diagnoses, source of referral, previous and subsequent use of outpatient services, and type of family problem were examined. Patients were from a low-income population and came from three ethnic groups (white, black, and Hispanic). RESULTS: Among whites, more men than women had family problems without mental disorders; among blacks, more women than men had family problems with and without mental disorders. Marital problems occurred most frequently in the group with family problems without mental disorders, and married subjects were more likely to have a V code condition. Professional referrals were more common than other referral sources in all three groups. However, family problems without mental disorders were more likely to occur among those who were referred by their families and had never had psychiatric treatment; patients with family problems and mental disorders were more likely to be self-referred and to have been previously treated; those with a mental disorder but without family problems were usually referred by professionals and almost always had been previously treated. There appeared to be underreporting of family problems among those with family problems and mental disorders and among black men with family problems with and without mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed on the patterns of use of outpatient psychiatric services by individuals with family problems and other V code conditions. \nUltrasonographic findings in thalamus and basal ganglia in term asphyxiated infants. Three severely asphyxiated term neonates demonstrated bilateral hyperechogenicity in the thalamus and basal ganglia. During evolution, areas of attenuated echogenicity appeared in these structures at the same time as periventricular cysts were evident in 2 patients with coexistent periventricular leukomalacia. All 3 patients developed ventricular dilatation; in the 2 patients with periventricular leukomalacia, the ventricular border was irregular in the outer (dorsal) margin, and interhemispheric fissures were widened as a manifestation of cerebral atrophy. Furthermore, the thalamic inner (ventral) margins of the lateral ventricles were irregular in all 3 patients. This previously unrecognized finding points to a particular form of cerebral atrophy localized in the gangliothalamic region that contributes to the development of ventriculomegaly. The reported sonographic sequence implies profound damage in the thalamus and basal ganglia in asphyxiated infants which undoubtedly has contributed to the poor outcomes of our patients. \nDiastolic disease in left ventricular hypertrophy: comparison of M mode and Doppler echocardiography for the assessment of rapid ventricular filling. OBJECTIVE--To investigate possible discrepancies between M mode and Doppler echocardiography in assessing early diastolic filling. DESIGN--Forty seven patients with left ventricular hypertrophy due to aortic stenosis and 26 healthy controls with a similar age range were studied by M mode, Doppler, apexcardiography, and phonocardiography. The patients also underwent cardiac catheterisation. M mode echograms were digitised by a computer. Early diastolic filling in both groups as assessed by the two techniques was compared. SETTING--A tertiary cardiac referral centre with facilities for non-invasive and invasive investigations. SUBJECTS--Patients referred for assessment of aortic stenosis who had left ventricular hypertrophy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Filling velocities on Doppler and rates of wall thinning and dimension increase on M mode. RESULTS--Digitised M mode indices of diastolic filling (peak wall thinning rate 6.4 (3.0) v 10.0 (3.0) cm/s and peak rate of dimension increase 9.3 (3.3) v 16 (4.5) cm/s) in the patients and controls were consistently different. In contrast, the Doppler A/E ratio and peak E wave velocity were not; they varied widely among patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. In part, this variability was because the Doppler A/E ratio, but not the digitised M mode indices, was very sensitive to the abnormalities of isovolumic relaxation frequently present in left ventricular hypertrophy. The Doppler A/E ratio varied similarly with age in both normal and hypertrophied hearts; in the patients with ventricular hypertrophy the peak rate of dimension increase depended on age only, whereas the thinning rate was independent of age in both the patients and controls. Neither the A/E ratio nor the M mode indices could be related to the left ventricular end diastolic pressure or the peak aortic pressure difference. CONCLUSIONS--When Doppler and M mode techniques are used to assess rapid filling in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy the M mode indices are more consistently abnormal. The two methods measure different aspects of left ventricular diastolic function and should be regarded as complementary rather than interchangeable. \nThe feeding pharyngostomy: an alternative approach to enteral feeding. We present a six-year retrospective review of feeding pharyngostomies as performed in this department. The indications, technique and complications of this procedure are discussed. \nPlasma profiles of adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, growth hormone and prolactin in patients with untreated Parkinson's disease. Plasma profiles of prolactin, growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol were evaluated in a group of untreated patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and a group of healthy age-matched controls. Plasma integrated concentrations of all hormones except prolactin were significantly lower in the patients as compared with the controls; however, prolactin nocturnal peak concentration was significantly elevated in the patients; nocturnal growth hormone levels were significantly reduced in the Parkinson group; ACTH and cortisol plasma concentrations were also consistently lower during most of the day in the patients with Parkinson's disease. These data confirm the presence of a hypothalamic disturbance in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which can affect pituitary function. \nPlasma concentrations of bupivacaine following combined sciatic and femoral 3 in 1 nerve blocks in open knee surgery. We administered combined femoral 3 in 1 and sciatic nerve blocks to provide postoperative pain relief in 22 consecutive patients undergoing elective knee replacement surgery under spinal anaesthesia. The patients were allocated randomly to two groups. In group A (n = 11) the blocks were performed with 0.5% bupivacaine (with adrenaline) 3 mg/kg body weight and in group B (n = 11) 0.5% plain bupivacaine in the same dose was used. Serial plasma concentrations of bupivacaine were measured for up to 2 h and the duration of postoperative analgesia was measured in both groups. No significant differences were found between the two groups. There were no clinical signs or symptoms of bupivacaine toxicity in each group. This study demonstrated that, after combined sciatic and 3 in 1 femoral block, concentrations of bupivacaine associated with toxicity were not reached, even though the dose of bupivacaine administered exceeded the manufacturer's recommended dose by 50%. \nImmunoglobulin response to intravenous streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE--To devise assays to assess and follow the specific antibody response in patients treated with streptokinase for acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN--Venous blood samples were collected before treatment with streptokinase started and subsequently at regular intervals over one year. Specific IgG and subclass IgG1 were assessed by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. SETTING--Coronary care unit in a general hospital. PATIENTS--48 patients with acute myocardial infarction: 22 patients had venous blood samples taken at presentation only; serial blood samples were taken from 20 patients who then received thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase and six patients who were unsuitable for thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS--Titres of antibodies to streptokinase were low at presentation in 36 (75%) of the 48 patients. Serial measurements made in 20 patients showed the virtual disappearance of antibody within the first 24 hours. This was followed by a steady increase in the specific IgG1 titre, which peaked at day 14 before gradually declining. Values at one year remained significantly higher than baseline values. There was no evidence of an IgM response in the patients studied. CONCLUSION--Low titres of antibodies to streptokinase were widespread in the population. Antibody was consumed after treatment and the subsequent immunoglobulin rise suggested a secondary immune responses; the recently described neutralising capacity to streptokinase is probably related to this antibody. \nMesonephric rest hyperplasia. A potential diagnostic pitfall. A case of mesonephric rest hyperplasia, an incidental finding in the hysterectomy specimen of a 48-year-old woman, was initially misdiagnosed as a well-differentiated cervical adenocarcinoma. We highlight the histologic, histochemical, and immunohistochemical features of this potential diagnostic pitfall and review the relevant literature. \nShoulder disorders in the elderly: a community survey. A community survey of identifiable symptomatic shoulder disorders in a sample of 644 elderly people over age 70 (318 male and 326 female) revealed a prevalence of 21%. Shoulder disorders were more common in women (25%, versus 17% in men). Approximately 70% of the cases of shoulder pain involved the rotator cuff. Fewer than 40% of the subjects sought medical attention for these symptoms. Increased medical awareness is needed, since the elderly often do not volunteer information about such symptoms. \nFollow-up bronchoalveolar lavage in AIDS patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Pneumocystis carinii burden predicts early relapse. We performed an analysis of the value of repeat bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at 21 days to identify patients at risk for early relapse with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Patients with P. carinii pneumonia and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were asked to participate in this study. All patients had P. carinii identi",
