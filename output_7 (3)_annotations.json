        "text": "age and pain were the most important variables in taking tablets to aid sleep. \nLong-term patient-controlled analgesia in children. Three children who received patient-controlled analgesia for periods of up to 41 days are described. In each case patient-controlled analgesia allowed pain control to be achieved in difficult situations. No patient developed tolerance or clinical signs of dependence. This use of long-term patient-controlled analgesia warrants further evaluation. \nTransmission of infectious diseases in outpatient health care settings. Increased provision of health care in outpatient settings and concerns about occupational transmission of infections have focused attention on the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in ambulatory health care settings. In contrast to inpatient nosocomial infections, infections transmitted in outpatient settings are neither systematically monitored nor likely to be detected by routine qi surveillance. To better define the spectrum of such events, we reviewed the literature to identify cases and clusters of infections associated with outpatient health care. In this review, we identified and epidemiologically characterized 53 such reports that occurred from 1961 through 1990. Transmission occurred in general medical offices, clinics, and emergency departments (23); ophthalmologists' offices and clinics (11); dental offices (13); and alternative-care settings (six). Our findings suggest that inpatient infection-control practices should be extended to outpatient health care settings by assigning specific responsibility for infection control and by adapting surveillance methods and prevention measures. \nStaphylococcus epidermidis induces complement activation, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, a shock-like state and tissue injury in rabbits without endotoxemia. Comparison to Escherichia coli. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 are thought to mediate many of the pathophysiologic changes of endotoxemia and Gram-negative bacteremia. In these studies, heat-killed Staphylococcus epidermidis were infused into rabbits to determine whether an endotoxin (LPS)-free microorganism also elicits cytokinemia and the physiologic abnormalities seen in Gram-negative bacteremia. S. epidermidis induced complement activation, circulating TNF and IL-1, and hypotension to the same degree as did one-twentieth the number of heat-killed Escherichia coli. Circulating IL-1 beta levels had a greater correlation coefficient (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) with the degree of hypotension than TNF levels (r = 0.48, P less than 0.02). Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diffuse pulmonary capillary aggregation of neutrophils, and hepatic necrosis with neutrophil infiltration were observed to the same extent after either S. epidermidis or E. coli infusion. However, S. epidermidis infusion did not induce significant (less than 60 pg/ml) endotoxemia, whereas E. coli infusion resulted in high (11,000 pg/ml) serum endotoxin levels. S. epidermidis, E. coli, LPS, or S. epidermidis-derived lipoteichoic acid (LTA) induced TNF and IL-1 from blood mononuclear cells in vitro. E. coli organisms and LPS were at least 100-fold more potent than S. epidermidis or LTA. Thus, a shock-like state with similar levels of complement activation as well as circulating levels of IL-1 and TNF were observed following either S. epidermidis or E. coli. These data provide further evidence that host factors such as IL-1 and TNF are common mediators of the septic shock syndrome regardless of the organism. \nPortal vein thrombosis complicating endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. Convincing further evidence. Portal vein thrombosis occurred in a patient who bled from gastric varices that developed after obliteration of esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy. This complication was recognized only at surgery when thrombectomy and endovenectomy preceded the successful placement of an end-to-side portocaval shunt. At histopathology, the presence of an amorphous, eosinophilic material staining negatively for fibrin and similar to sclerosant injected at sclerotherapy was observed within the clot. This latter finding, previously unreported, provides convincing evidence for the causal relationship of portal vein thrombosis to endoscopic sclerotherapy. \nPrevention of perioperative deep vein thrombosis in general surgery: a multicentre double blind study comparing two doses of Logiparin and standard heparin. H.B.P.M. Research Group. A total of 1290 patients were enrolled in a randomized multicentre double blind study in order to investigate the use of two doses of a new low molecular weight heparin, Logiparin, in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in general surgery. Patients who were included had no contraindication to heparin therapy and had at least one of the recognized risk factors for DVT. Patients were randomized to receive unfractionated heparin (UH) 5000 units b.d., Logiparin 2500 units daily or Logiparin 3500 units daily. Each treatment was given subcutaneously 2 h before surgery and continued for 7-10 days. Daily 125I-labelled fibrinogen uptake tests (FUTs) were performed from day 2 to day 7 to detect DVT, and phleboangiography was used to confirm the diagnosis. The wound was examined on a daily basis to check for haematoma formation, and all patients were followed up for 1 month after operation. All three treatment arms were well matched for age, sex, weight, diagnosis and type of operation performed. The three major inclusion criteria in the trial were malignancy, age over 60 years and a history of varicose veins. Positive FUTs (UH = 4.2 per cent, Logiparin 2500 units daily = 7.9 per cent, Logiparin 3500 units daily = 3.7 per cent) and positive angiograms (UH = 3.0 per cent, Logiparin 2500 units daily = 5.6 per cent, Logiparin 3500 units daily = 2.3 per cent) were significantly more common in the Logiparin 2500 units daily group than in the UH and Logiparin 3500 units daily groups. The rates of major complications (severe haemorrhage, death, pulmonary embolism, reintervention) were similar in the three groups. \nTreatment of pulmonary endometriosis with a long-acting GnRH agonist. We report the case of a patient who was successfully treated with a long-acting GnRH agonist for pulmonary endometriosis. This 28-year-old woman had symptomatic pleural endometriosis, documented by biopsies, as well as symptomatic pelvic endometriosis. Two surgical procedures, consisting of excision of pleural endometriotic tissue and partial pleurectomies, failed to relieve her chest symptoms. Little relief was achieved with pseudopregnancy treatment. Satisfactory symptomatic improvement was obtained with danazol, but this medication had to be discontinued because of severe side effects. Trial of a GnRH agonist, leuprolide acetate, achieved complete remission of her chest symptoms; in addition, the patient became pregnant immediately after cessation of therapy. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy may be an important therapeutic alternative for women with pulmonary endometriosis who cannot tolerate danazol treatment and in whom surgical therapy fails to relieve the chest symptoms. \nOne hundred ten consecutive primary orthotopic liver transplants under FK 506 in adults. An account is given of the 6- to 12-month survival, and causes of failure in 110 consecutive patients who underwent primary liver transplantation under treatment from the outset with FK 506 and steroids. The patient survival is 92.7%, and the first graft survival is 87.3%. At a very high frequency, the patients achieved good graft function, and they had a relatively low morbidity that was partially ascribable to minimal use and early discontinuance (in 60% of cases) of steroids. Renal dysfunction and other adverse findings were largely confined to patients with poor initial graft function and consequent apparent alteration of the kinetics of FK 506 elimination, causing functional overdosage. Results compare very favorably with our past record using conventional immunosuppression, and support the belief that FK 506 is a superior immunosuppressive agent which is suitable for chronic administration. \nHepatic perfusion index (HPI) in mesenteric angina and following successful revascularization. This is a case report of a 45 year old man who had previously undergone a small bowel resection for acute mesenteric ischaemia. He subsequently suffered from mesenteric angina due to stenosis of the origin of the superior mesenteric artery and intermittent claudication due to aorto-iliac atheroma. The patient underwent a successful aorto-bifemoral Y graft and small bowel revascularization with a saphenous vein graft between the Y graft and the accessible proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery. Before vascular reconstruction, the hepatic perfusion indices (HPI) in both the fasted and fed states were elevated; after mesenteric revascularization the HPI values were substantially lowered. The hepatic perfusion index may, by demonstrating functional abnormality, be useful in the diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia and also in the assessment of treatment. Further evaluation of HPI in patients with suspected mesenteric ischaemia is therefore required. \nDiagnosis and management of Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis characterized by mucosal inflammation, rash, cervical adenopathy, indurative edema of the hands and feet, and late membranous desquamation of the fingertips. Early cardiac effects include myocarditis (occasionally with congestive heart failure), pericardial inflammation, and, rarely, valve involvement. Coronary artery aneurysms are a long-term concern because coronary thrombosis with myocardial infarction can be a late manifestation. The origin of Kawasaki disease is unknown, but an infectious agent is most likely. Management consists of aspirin for control of fever and inflammatory manifestations and intravenous gamma globulin for the prevention of coronary aneurysm formation. Careful late follow-up is required, especially for patients with persistent coronary abnormalities. Giant aneurysms (greater than 8 mm) are more likely to progress to coronary obstructive disease, and coronary bypass grafts have been required for some patients. Late coronary artery manifestations in patients with mild early coronary dilatation have not been described. However, since long-term epidemiologic studies have not yet been performed, it is prudent to consider childhood Kawasaki disease to be a potential risk factor for coronary disease, especially in atherosclerosis-prone Western societies. \nCharacterization of in vivo expression of the human papillomavirus type 16 E4 protein in cervical biopsy tissues. The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins in the pathogenesis of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical cancer is poorly understood. To characterize E4 protein expression in 49 paraffin-embedded cervical biopsies representing different histopathologic grades of disease, antibodies were elicited to a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 20-34 of a protein predicted to be encoded by the HPV 16 E4 open reading frame. The E4 protein was detected throughout the spectrum of CIN, from CIN1 to CIN3. Expression was localized to the cell nucleus, primarily in the superficial layers of the squamous cervical epithelium. Ultrastructural studies showed that the E4 protein was organized into compact, intranuclear arrays 25-35 nm in diameter. E4 protein expression was also demonstrated in some histologically normal tissues containing HPV 16 DNA, but not in any of five cervical cancers containing HPV 16 DNA. These results suggest that E4 protein expression may precede development of light microscopic tissue abnormalities, that it may continue through the spectrum of CIN, and that expression of this protein may be reduced or terminated in invasive cancer. The function of this protein remains unknown, but its nuclear localization may be consistent with a role in viral maturation. \nDiscontinuation of lithium treatment in remitted bipolar patients: relationship between clinical outcome and changes in sleep-wake cycles. In this preliminary report, we describe four patients in whom long-term lithium therapy was discontinued, combined with actigraphic monitoring to assess changes in motor activity and the sleep-wake cycle. Two patients experienced rapid relapse of manic symptomatology, while two remained stable throughout a 1-year follow-up. Actigraphic monitoring revealed disintegration of the sleep-wake cycle and increased motor activity in the relapsed patients only. It is suggested that actigraphic recordings can be used to monitor lithium discontinuation. \nConventional blood conservation techniques in 500 consecutive coronary artery bypass operations. With use of a nonpharmacological, simple, and inexpensive program for blood conservation, 500 consecutive patients underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting without need of homologous red cell transfusions in 493 (98.6%). At least one internal mammary artery was grafted in all but 1 patient, with supplemental saphenous vein grafts. Intraoperatively, autologous heparinized blood was removed before bypass and retransfused at the conclusion of extracorporeal circulation. The volume remaining in the oxygenator and tubing set was returned without cell processing or hemofiltration. Using the hard-shell cardiotomy reservoir from the heart-lung machine, autotransfusion of the shed mediastinal blood was continued hourly up to 18 hours after operation. The mean postoperative mediastinal blood loss was 643 +/- 354 mL, whereas 624 +/- 296 mL was autotransfused. Thirteen patients (2.6%) needed reexploration for bleeding, of whom 7 (7/500, 1.4%) received homologous blood. No other patients required red cell transfusions. In addition, 9 patients were given a mean of 2.6 units of fresh frozen plasma because of suspected coagulopathy. No platelets were transfused, and no cryoprecipitate therapy was undertaken. Thus, in total, 484 patients (96.8%) were not exposed to any homologous blood products during the hospital stay. At discharge, the mean hemoglobin concentration was 121 +/- 14 g/L (12.1 +/- 1.4 g/dL) and the hematocrit, 0.36 +/- 0.04. Postoperative complications were few. There was one in-hospital death (0.2%). \nNatural history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease without oesophagitis. This retrospective study was undertaken to characterise the clinical course and reflux pattern of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux without evidence of oesophagitis. We investigated 33 patients (12 women, 21 men; mean age 36 years) with typical symptoms, a negative oesophagoscopy, and a 24 hour oesophageal pH-metry indicative of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux. All patients received antacids or prokinetic drugs or both for three to six months. Nineteen of 33 patients still had symptoms at the end of treatment, of whom five had developed erosive changes of the oesophageal mucosa. The other 14 discontinued treatment and remained asymptomatic during a six month follow up period. Comparison of the pretreatment pH-metry data of the 19 symptomatic patients and the 14 asymptomatic patients showed no differences in the pattern of gastro-oesophageal reflux in the two groups. We conclude that in a substantial proportion of patients with pathological reflux without oesophagitis symptoms may persist and mucosal lesions may develop during conventional treatment without any apparent change in the reflux. Patients who developed endoscopic oesophagitis did not have a more severe pretreatment pattern of gastro-oesophageal reflux when compared with those who did not develop oesophageal mucosal damage. \nCopper loading of hearts increases postischemic reperfusion injury. We studied the role of copper as a potential mediator of postischemic reperfusion injury in the isolated, perfused rat heart. Hearts were equilibrated with Krebs-Henseleit buffer for 10 minutes and then loaded with copper by way of perfusion with buffer containing 20 microM copper(II)-bis-histidial for 30 minutes. Control hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer alone during the loading period. Hearts than were washed with buffer for 10 minutes and subjected to 20 minutes of normothermic global ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed a 67% increase in total copper content in loaded hearts by the end of the wash. By the end of the 30-minute period of reperfusion, control hearts demonstrated a 50-60% recovery of myocardial function as determined by peak systolic pressure, contractility, and heart rate. In contrast, copper-loaded hearts exhibited virtually no functional recovery within the 30-minute time period. Using salicylate as a probe, we determined that peak and duration of .OH formation appears to be increased in copper-loaded hearts during reperfusion. Furthermore, efflux of lactic dehydrogenase was significantly increased in copper-loaded hearts. Our results clearly demonstrate that increasing cardiac content of copper results in enhanced postischemic reperfusion injury associated with increased formation of .OH, thus suggesting an important catalytic role for this transition metal. \nGastric cancer in Scotland: changing epidemiology, unchanging workload. OBJECTIVE--To determine the changes in incidence of and mortality from gastric cancer in Scotland between 1978 and 1987 and in the operative workload in Lothian between 1979 and 1988. DESIGN--Analysis of national incidence statistics for gastric cancer derived from the Scottish national cancer registry, deaths from gastric cancer recorded by the registrar general for Scotland, and Lothian surgical audit data. SETTING--Scotland and Lothian Health Board area. PATIENTS--Patients in Scotland with gastric cancer during 1978 to 1987 inclusive; patients in Scotland with gastric cancer recorded on their death certificate as cause of death during 1978 to 1987; patients who had an operation in Lothian for gastric cancer during 1979 to 1988. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in incidence of and mortality from gastric cancer in Scotland from 1978 to 1987 and in the number of operations performed for gastric cancer in Lothian from 1979 to 1988. RESULTS--Mortality from gastric cancer in Scotland fell by about 25% over the 10 years. The incidence and standardised incidence of gastric cancer showed a marginal decline of about 9%. The differences in trends between incidence and mortality were significant (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--This study shows that the surgical workload associated with gastric cancer is not declining. This is because the incidence has remained almost static, which may be due to the relative increase in the numbers of older people in the population, who are at greater risk of developing gastric cancer. Gastric cancer should not be regarded as a disease in decline. Incidence and workload should determine resources allocated to this disease rather than mortality statistics. \nMucin-hypersecreting tumor of the pancreas with mucin extrusion through an enlarged papilla. Patient records, imaging films, macroscopic and microscopic features, and clinical follow-up data of seven Japanese patients with a mucin-hypersecreting tumor of the pancreas were reviewed. The mucin-hypersecreting tumor was defined as an enlarged major or minor papilla with a dilated orifice and visible mucin oozing on endoscopy. The series consisted of six men and one woman ranging from 47 to 79 yr old. The excretion of mucin through a patulous orifice of the enlarged ampulla of Vater was seen in six patients and of the enlarged minor papilla in the other patient with pancreas divisum. The main pancreatic duct was dilated in all patients. Amorphous mucin was seen in the dilated duct of five patients, and papillary nodules were present in two patients. Computed tomography and/or ultrasonography showed dilatation of the main pancreatic duct with multilocular cysts in six patients and with a solid tumor in the other patient. The tumor was located diffusely in the main pancreatic duct in one patient, whereas it was confined to branches in the head (four patients), body (one patient), or tail (one patient) of the pancreas in the six other patients. Histopathologic diagnosis was a cyst lined by hyperplastic mucus-secreting epithelium in one patient, mucinous cystadenoma in two, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma in two. Five patients underwent resection and have survived for 1-46 months after the operation. The authors would like to emphasize this endoscopic syndrome because about half of mucin-hypersecreting tumors are malignant with a favorable prognosis. \nThe correlation between immunological reaction in the arterial wall and the time course of the development of cerebral vasospasm in a primate model. To investigate the role of immunological reactions in the development of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the authors studied the correlation between immune/inflammatory reactions in the arterial wall and the time course of vasospasm in primates. Twenty monkeys were divided into four groups of 5 animals each: 1) a control group of sham-operated animals, 2) animals subjected to angiography 3 days after the induction of SAH (3-day SAH), 3) animals subjected to angiography 7 days after SAH (1-week SAH), and 4) animals subjected to angiography 7 and 14 days after SAH (2-week SAH). To induce SAH, the main cerebral arteries on the right were dissected free of the arachnoid, and an autologous blood clot was placed around the arteries. To evaluate vasospasm, all animals underwent a baseline angiogram before SAH; angiography was repeated at different intervals in each group, as outlined above. Histopathological changes and the deposition of the immunoglobulin IgG in the arterial wall were evaluated immunohistochemically in each group. The cerebral arteries on the side of the clot showed evidence of mild vasospasm (-24.6% reduction) on the angiogram performed on Day 3, severe vasospasm (-51.7%) on Day 7, and mild vasospasm (-12.8%) on Day 14. The infiltration of inflammatory cells was most marked in the spastic arterial wall in the 1-week SAH group. In the 2-week SAH group, severe myonecrosis and intimal disruption were observed, even in the vessels that showed only mild vasospasm, and the inflammatory reactions had almost abated. \nDecreasing survival benefit from cardiac transplantation for outpatients as the waiting list lengthens. Many patients are accepted for cardiac transplantation during a period of clinical instability associated with a high risk of death, even though most can be discharged home to await transplantation. As the waiting lists lengthen, priority is awarded solely on the basis of the waiting time of outpatients, who now usually undergo transplantation after they have already survived a major period of jeopardy. To determine the impact of the current waiting times and priority system on the previously expected benefit offered by transplantation, 1-year actuarial survival without transplantation was recalculated after each month without transplantation for 214 potential candidates with an ejection fraction of 0.17 +/- 0.05 discharged on tailored medical therapy after evaluation. These data were compared with the 1-year survival data of 88 outpatients who underwent transplantation. Actuarial survival after 1 year was 67% on tailored therapy compared with 88% after transplantation (p = 0.009). Death without transplantation was sudden in 43 of 51 patients, resulting from hemodynamic decompensation in 8. For outpatients already surviving 6 months without transplantation, actuarial survival over the next 12 months was 83% without transplantation. Thus, the expected improvement in survival after transplantation would be only 5% over the subsequent year for patients waiting 6 months, which is the waiting time for many outpatients. Such patients should be reevaluated to determine whether transplantation remains indicated during the next year. \nOccipital meningoceles in patients with the Dandy-Walker syndrome. Occipital cephaloceles in the Dandy-Walker syndrome are not rare. To date, 28 cases have been reported. We report on 8 cases of associated occipital meningocele, totalling 16% of all patients with the Dandy-Walker syndrome in our series. In all patients, communication existed between the posterior fossa cyst and the occipital meningocele. In 2 patients, the occipital meningocele disappeared after cerebrospinal fluid shunting and never required surgical repair. It appears that the cranial defect had ossified and resulted in self-closure. Poor intellectual development in persons with the Dandy-Walker syndrome is associated with the presence of other central nervous system and systemic abnormalities and not with occipital meningoceles alone. \nApplication of intermediate biomarkers to studies of cancer prevention in the gastrointestinal tract: introduction and perspective. In this article, abnormalities in the proliferation and differentiation of gastrointestinal cells are described in diseases that increase predisposition to gastrointestinal cancer. Recent findings related to the effects of calcium on gastrointestinal cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumor occurrence in rodent models and in human subjects are summarized. \nNutritional support of patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. Malnutrition is extremely common in patients with malignant disease. Whereas the causes are multifactorial, the predominant factor is the imbalance between nutrient intake and host nutrient requirements. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that cachexia is related to abnormal changes in host intermediary metabolism induced by host-tumor interactions, and endogenous peptides such as TNF may be important mediators. The role of nutritional therapy in cancer patients remains to be defined. Clearly, patients with severe malnutrition benefit from nutritional intervention. However, the benefit of nutritional therapy in less severe cases of malnutrition as an adjuvant to oncologic therapy has yet to be established. \nCarpal tunnel syndrome: objective measures and splint use. One hundred five adults with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were studied to assess the efficacy of a neutral-angle wrist splint, and to identify criteria for splint referral. Ten observations before and after treatment were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. After splint use, 67% of the subjects reported symptom relief. T-test comparison of sensory latency of values before and after treatment indicated improvement for the total group. Chi-square and t-tests failed to reveal significant differences between relief and no-relief groups for gender, affected hand, presence of concomitant conditions, duration of symptoms before treatment, age, length of time between pretreatment and posttreatment nerve conduction testing, initial nerve latency of motor and sensory fibers, or the difference between pretreatment and posttreatment sensory latencies. A significant difference was found for motor latency; the relief group improved and the no-relief group deteriorated. Data suggest that splinting is most effective if applied within three months of symptom onset. Those with damage to the wrist structures or median nerve were least responsive to splinting. \nShort-term antibiotic treatment in Whipple's disease. We report the results of short-term antibiotic treatment in 19 patients with Whipple's disease (WD). The diagnosis was based on clinical features and on a characteristic small bowel biopsy. Patients received treatment for a mean of 7.9 weeks (range 4-20). Fourteen were treated with de-methyl-chlortetracycline (600 mg/day), and 1 also received chloramphenicol (1 g/day); 1 was treated with ampicillin (2 g/day), and 4 were treated with amoxicillin (1.5 g/day). In all patients, the clinical response was rapid and excellent, body weight increased significantly, diarrhea subsided, and fecal fat values returned to normal. Intestinal biopsies obtained after treatment was completed showed significant improvement based on a decrease in the number of macrophages staining positive with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), normalization of villous structure, and decreased dilatation of lymphatic channels; free bacilli were absent, as shown both by light and electron microscopy. Seventeen patients have been followed for a mean of 99.4 months (range 6-300). Two died 30 and 72 months after diagnosis of Whipple's disease, 1 of laryngeal carcinoma and the other of colonic carcinoma. Fifteen patients are in excellent health. Three patients treated with tetracycline have had clinical and/or histologic relapses. In our experience, short-course antibiotic treatment with tetracycline or ampicillin and derivatives can be effective in WD, with few relapses and excellent outcome. No neurologic symptoms, either initially or during follow-up were observed. \nPrevalence of dementia in the 'oldest old' of a Dutch community. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence rate of dementia in subjects 85 years of age and over. DESIGN: A two-phase design with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in the screening phase and the Geriatric Mental State Schedule (GMS) in the diagnostic phase. SETTING: Community survey including subjects in residential care. SUBJECTS: All (n = 1,259) inhabitants of Leiden, The Netherlands, aged 85 years and over on December 1, 1986. First phase participation rate was 71% (17% dropout due to death); second phase participation rate was 82%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: DSM-III diagnosis of dementia without further specification of the etiology of the dementia. RESULTS: An overall prevalence rate of 23% (95% C.I.: 19%-26%) was found. This included 12% mild dementia, 7% moderate and 4% severe dementia. The prevalence rate was higher among women (24%) than among men (18%). It increased with age from 19% (95% C.I.: 16%-22%) in the group of 85-89 years to 32% (95% C.I.: 26%-39%) in the group of 90-94 years to 41% (95% C.I.: 25%-58%) in the 95+ group. CONCLUSION: A fifth of the 85+ and a third of the 90+ population suffer from dementia with an indication that half of the 95+ population is affected. With the expected steep rise in the number of the oldest old, dementia will stay a major health problem in the near future. \nMastoid misery: quantifying the distress in a radical cavity. Seventy-eight mastoid cavities were studied in 39 patients who required revision surgery for troublesome symptoms. A retrospective questionnaire was used to assign a symptom score to each patient in his pre and post-operative condition. The 5 leading symptoms of pain, wax, discharge, smell and giddiness were reviewed. A score of 15 points represented the worst case and zero the best. The average improvement after surgery was 4.7 points. Hearing was not considered in this study. \nEfficacy and cost effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in women with node-negative breast cancer. A decision-analysis model. BACKGROUND. In 1988 the National Cancer Institute issued a Clinical Alert that has been widely interpreted as recommending that all women with node-negative breast cancer receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Acceptance of this recommendation is controversial, since many women who would not have a recurrence would be treated. METHODS. Using a decision-analysis model, we studied the cost effectiveness of chemotherapy in cohorts of 45-year-old and 60-year-old women with node-negative breast cancer by calculating life expectancy as adjusted for quality of life. The analysis evaluated different scenarios of the benefit of therapy: improved disease-free survival for five years, with a lesser effect on overall survival (base line); a lifelong benefit from chemotherapy; and a benefit in disease-free survival with no change in overall survival by year 10. The base-line analysis assumed a 30 percent reduction in the relative risk of recurrence for five years after treatment. RESULTS. For the 45-year-old woman, the base-line analysis found an average lifetime benefit from chemotherapy of 5.1 quality-months at a cost of $15,400 per quality-year. The 60-year-old women gained 4.0 quality-months at a cost of $18,800 per quality-year. Under the more and less optimistic scenarios, the benefit of chemotherapy varied from 1.4 to 14.0 quality-months for both groups. CONCLUSIONS. Chemotherapy substantially increases the quality-adjusted life expectancy of an average woman at a cost comparable to that of other widely accepted therapies. This benefit decreases markedly if the changes in long-term survival are less than in disease-free survival. Given its uncertain duration, the benefit may be too small for many women to choose chemotherapy. Selective use of chemotherapy to maximize the benefit to individual patients may be possible with refinements in risk stratification and explicit assessment of the patients' risk preferences. \nCivilian craniocerebral gunshot wounds. Experience with 120 patients who incurred a gunshot wound to the head with dural penetration is presented. All of the patients were managed by a standard resuscitation protocol and assigned a clinical grade based on their level of consciousness both at the time of presentation and at 2 to 4 months after injury. Fifty patients (42%) underwent surgery. Twenty-eight patients (23%) had a good recovery, 19 (16%) were moderately disabled, 6 (5%) were severely disabled, and 67 (56%) died. All patients who were alert and awake with a normal or near normal neurological examination at the time of admission survived with a good outcome. All but 4 patients who were comatose at the time of admission died. Nine patients, however, who were not comatose at the time of admission died from potentially preventable causes. In 3 of these patients, a more aggressive diagnostic approach (including cerebral angiography) may have altered their ultimate outcome. An expeditious approach to the trauma victim with a comprehensive management scheme after injury may have altered the course in the remainder of these patients. \nTotal androgen ablation: European experience. The EORTC GU Group. Zoladex plus flutamide significantly delays the time to progression (subjective, objective, first progression) compared with orchiectomy, but no difference in survival (death from all causes or from malignant disease) could be detected. Thus, a delay in the appearance of progression has not improved survival. In fact, the duration of survival after progression tends to be shorter on Zoladex plus flutamide. There is thus no evidence to suggest any survival benefit with Zoladex plus flutamide. The quality control of our data revealed acknowledged problems in defining responses in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The review of the Bone Scan Committee provided the data for Tables 5 to 7. These data must provoke some reflections and emphasize once again the heterogeneity of the studied patient population. Table 4 on pain response after 4 weeks is just one of the many items to be analyzed by the committees for response criteria and quality of life. We expect that the other trials face similar problems. More work and patience are needed to obtain a firm answer to this clinical problem. These efforts will never be wasted, however, because the combined results of these trials will increase our knowledge of the treated history of prostate cancer and will, we hope, indicate a net treatment benefit in some subsets of patients. An individually tailored treatment for each patient selected from the anonymous mass of cases of advanced prostate cancer would be the highest reward of our continued collaboration with all the study groups. \nUse of modified diets in nursing homes. Randomly chosen medical charts of 212 elderly subjects in 11 nursing homes were reviewed to determine which characteristics of the subjects were most closely associated with their diet prescriptions. The chart reviews indicated that 104 (49.0%) of the 212 subjects had some type of nutrient-modified diet prescription. Eight patients who were tube fed were not included in subsequent analyses. Sodium restriction was the most common modification (60 [29.4%] of the remaining 204 patients) and calorie-controlled diets were also common (52 [25.5%] of the patients). Of the 55 patients with hypertension, 31 (56.4%) had no sodium restriction. Only 10% of all low-sodium diets limited sodium to 2 g per day. Of the 38 patients with diabetes, 7 (18.4%) had no prescription for calorie control, and there was no indication that increased dietary fiber was encouraged for diabetic patients. Only one of the 121 subjects with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease or atherosclerosis had a prescription for a cholesterol-lowering diet. Characteristics of the subjects not specifically related to diet or diagnosis, such as age, sex, duration of stay, and level of care, had no significant relationship to diet prescription. These findings suggest that the practitioners in our sample were not convinced of the efficacy of modified diets to control disease for most nursing home residents. \nThoracoscopic carbon dioxide laser treatment of bullous emphysema. A new technique of thoracoscopic laser ablation of pulmonary bullae suitable for patients with multiple bullae and diffuse emphysema was developed and assessed in 22 patients. 20 of 22 patients survived. Pre-operative and postoperative functional evaluation is available for the 11 patients followed up for more than a month; at 1 to 3 months postoperatively there were increases in FVC (mean 2.0 litres pre-operatively to 2.7 litres postoperatively, p less than 0.001), in FEV1 (0.74 to 1.06 litres, p = 0.01), and in maximum exercise treadmill times (5.4 min to 8.0 min, p less than 0.01). Postoperative air leaks lasted a mean of 13 days and usually resolved spontaneously. Other complications were bleeding (1 patient) and unilateral acute lung injury (1 patient). These results suggest that selected patients with diffuse emphysema and pulmonary bullae may benefit from thoracoscopic carbon dioxide laser ablation. \nMethotrexate and histologic hepatic abnormalities: a meta-analysis. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of liver toxicity from the long-term administration of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of 15 studies examining the relationship between long-term, low-dose methotrexate administration and biopsy evidence of liver fibrosis. PATIENTS: A total of 636 patients from 15 studies. RESULTS: The incidence of progression of liver disease (defined as worsening of at least one grade on the histologic classification of Roenigk) among 636 patients was 27.9% (95% confidence intervals 24.3 to 31.6). The rate of progression of liver disease in the 15 studies was associated with the cumulative dose of methotrexate (p = 0.01). Patients on average had a 6.7% (95% confidence intervals 2.1 to 11.4) chance of progressing at least one histologic grade on liver biopsy for each gram of methotrexate taken. The overall incidence of advanced pathologic changes on liver biopsy (grades IIIB or IV) among 636 patients was 5.0% (95% confidence intervals 3.5 to 7.0). The development of advanced histologic changes was not associated with the cumulative dose of methotrexate (p = 0.08). Patients who according to their history were heavy drinkers (at least 100 g of alcohol per week) were more likely to have advanced changes on liver biopsy (17.8% versus 4.5%, p = 0.0003) and to show histologic progression (73.3% versus 25.9%, p = 0.0002). Patients with psoriasis were more likely than patients with rheumatoid arthritis to have advanced changes (7.7% versus 2.7%, p = 0.003) and histologic progression (33.1% versus 24.3%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of liver toxicity in patients undergoing long-term, low-dose methotrexate therapy is substantial, and that risk increases with the total cumulative dose and with heavy consumption of alcohol. Heavy users of alcohol should not receive long-term methotrexate therapy. For most patients who are not heavy users of alcohol, liver biopsies should be done periodically to monitor for the occurrence of liver toxicity. \nA practical guide to nitrate use. Nitrate preparations are useful in the treatment of acute and chronic angina, acute and chronic congestive heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction. Development of tolerance is best managed by providing a nitrate-free interval, thus avoiding continuous drug levels. This interval probably should be 10 to 12 hours with use of a transdermal patch. Nitrate treatment of the elderly may require lower doses to avoid hypotension. \nRadial nerve paralysis and tumor. This paper presents ten cases of radial nerve paralysis because of tumor and reviews 38 previously reported cases. The tumor distribution was 35 lipomas, four neurofibromas, four ganglions, three neuromas, one fibroma, and one neurilemoma. Malignant tumors are not discussed in this review. Electromyography is of value if diagnostic problems occur. Postoperative results are normally good. \nMassive ST-segment elevation without myocardial injury in a patient with fulminant hepatic failure and cerebral edema. A 49-year-old woman presented in fulminant hepatic failure. The ECG showed dramatic ST-segment elevation, suggesting diffuse myocardial injury. However, echocardiography, creatine phosphokinase enzyme determinations, and examination of the heart at autopsy (six days later) failed to demonstrate any physiologic, anatomic, or histologic evidence of abnormality. The appearance of ST-segment elevation in this setting should not prompt treatment for cardiac disease or limit the candidacy for liver transplantation of such critically ill patients. \nMononeuropathy in sickle cell anemia: anatomical and pathophysiological basis for its rarity. Peripheral neuropathy is a rare complication of sickle cell disease. We report a young black woman with sickle cell anemia who developed a proximal median mononeuropathy in the setting of sickle cell crisis. The clinical and electrodiagnostic features are consistent with an ischemic mechanism from the sickling process. The pathophysiological basis for the rarity of this complication may be related to the rich anastomotic microvasculature of peripheral nerve and the unique large size of the capillaries of this vascular network. \nScleral buckling for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with severe myopia. From Jan. 1, 1980, to Dec. 31, 1989, we performed scleral buckling surgery on 48 eyes of 46 patients for rhegmatogenous retinal detachments associated with severe myopia (greater than 5.00 diopters). Forty eyes of 38 patients were observed for at least six months, and the mean follow-up period was 46 months. Intraoperative complications occurred in four of 48 eyes (8%) and included retinal incarceration (two eyes), choroidal hemorrhage (one eye), and choroidal detachment (one eye). Three of the 40 eyes (7.5%) followed up for more than six months developed a recurrent retinal detachment and underwent a revision of the scleral buckle. At the last follow-up examination, the retinas of all 40 eyes were totally reattached. Final visual acuity of 20/40 or better was attained in 26 of 40 eyes (65%). Because of the low rate of intraoperative complications and the high rate of success, scleral buckling is recommended for most patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments associated with severe myopia. \nCost-effectiveness analysis of mass screening for breast cancer in Japan. The official Japanese recommendation for breast cancer screening is physical examination by a physician, in contrast to US recommendations of mammography. In this analysis of breast cancer screening, the authors used Japanese data in a cost-effectiveness model to compare the following five strategies: (1) no screening (N); (2) physical examination alone (PE); (3) mammography (MG); (4) PE followed by MG if PE findings were abnormal (PE----MG); and (5) PE combined with MG for all screened women (PE + MG). None of these programs would save medical expenditures. The total discounted net costs per patient (in US dollars) were as follows: N, +54; PE, +412; MG, +517; PE----MG, +340; and PE + MG, +731. The number of years of life saved per cohort of 100,000 asymptomatic Japanese women would range from 708 (PE----MG) to 3724 (PG + MG). The additional cost of each strategy (compared with N) per additional year of life would be +49,700 for PE, +40,400 for PE----MG, +14,300 for MG, and +18,000 for PE + MG. The least costly screening option (PE----MG) does not have the lowest cost per additional year of life saved (MG does). MG would be preferable to the current Japanese recommendation of PE alone. \nC-erbB-2 oncogene protein in in situ and invasive lobular breast neoplasia. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) has uncertain malignant potential; biologic markers that will identify patients at risk for a poor clinical outcome have been sought actively. Amplification of the c-erbB-2 protooncogene has been correlated with poor prognosis in invasive mammary carcinoma, and immunohistochemical evaluation for expression of the oncogene protein has been correlated with gene amplification. The authors retrospectively evaluated 62 cases of lobular neoplasia for expression of the c-erbB-2 gene product on formalin-fixed, deparaffinized sections, using two monoclonal anti-erbB-2 (p185) antibodies (c-neu Ab3 and m-erb) and one polyclonal anti-erbB-2 antibody (pAb 1) by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. All 62 cases were negative with the pAb 1 antibody; one of 62 cases was weakly positive with the c-neu Ab3 in a membranous pattern. Expression of c-erbB-2 gene product was identified on adjacent invasive ductal carcinoma in one case and in adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ in another. None of 15 cases if infiltrating lobular carcinoma was positive with either of the two anti-c-erbB-2 antibodies. Strong positivity was found on benign epithelium in one case, demonstrating epitheliosis. In summary, evidence of expression of the c-erbB-2 gene product was found in one of 57 cases of LCIS and none of 15 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma. This suggests that, in contrast to reported data concerning intraductal and invasive ductal carcinoma, c-erbB-2 oncogene amplification and/or overexpression does not play a significant role in the progression of lobular breast neoplasia. \nCarcinoembryonic antigen and head and neck cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentrations were determined in the sera of 45 patients with a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and of 13 controls. In 13 patients serial CEA measurements were made during the follow-up period. In 38% of the patients the serum CEA level was slightly elevated (greater than or equal to 2.5 ng/ml). Only 13% of the patients had clearly elevated CEA levels (greater than 5 ng/ml). CEA levels were significantly higher in patients with advanced, e.g. stage IV, disease but a correlation between serum CEA concentration and prognosis was not found. Patients who smoked had significantly higher serum CEA levels than non-smoking patients. In the serial determinations slight CEA elevations could be found in only 50% of patients with tumour recurrence. Combined with the data from the literature we conclude that serum CEA determination is not useful in predicting the outcome in patients with a head and neck squamous carcinoma. \nSpinal cord herniation associated with an intradural spinal arachnoid cyst diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. Two rare cases of spinal cord herniation associated with intradural spinal arachnoid cyst are reported. A preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated the presence of spinal cord herniation, identified as a protrusion continuous with the spinal cord. Surgery upon the intradural spinal arachnoid cyst improved progressive neurological dysfunction. The authors postulate that spinal cord herniation occurred for the following reason: The pressure of the intradural arachnoid cyst on the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord caused thinning of the dura, leading to a tear and, thus, the development of an extradural arachnoid cyst. Along with the enlargement of intradural arachnoid cyst, the spinal cord herniated through the tear in the dura into the extradural arachnoid cyst. \nIntraluminal pulsed Doppler evaluation of the pulmonary artery velocity time curve in a canine model of acute pulmonary hypertension. The velocity pattern of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery was investigated in an animal model of acute pulmonary hypertension. Nine anesthetized, open-chest dogs were embolized with polystyrene microspheres, and the velocity pattern of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery was studied with use of an invasive pulsed Doppler technique. Phasic intraluminal velocity was recorded with use of a miniature piezoelectric crystal activated by 20-MHz Doppler pulses and mounted on the tip of a needle probe introduced into the pulmonary artery. The recorded Doppler quadrature signals were processed by spectral analysis. Significant increases occurred in mean, systolic, and diastolic pulmonary arterial pressures (p less than 0.0002), in pulmonary vascular resistance (p less than 0.005), and in negative velocity time (duration in milliseconds that the mean velocity was directed toward the pulmonic valve) (p less than 0.002). Significant decreases occurred in right ventricular ejection time (p less than 0.006) and in positive velocity time (duration in milliseconds that the mean velocity was directed away from the pulmonic valve) (p less than 0.005). A significant shortening in the time to peak velocity (acceleration time) was found (p less than 0.005). Second-order regression analyses demonstrated an inverse correlation between the ratio of positive velocity time to negative velocity time and the mean pulmonary artery pressure in all animals (r = 0.71). These findings should be compared with the velocity patterns of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery obtained under pulmonary hypertensive conditions due to various causes to facilitate interpretation and understanding of clinical investigations. \nEnergy state and vasomotor tone in hypoxic pig lungs. To evaluate the role of energy state in pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia, we exposed isolated pig lungs to decreases in inspired PO2 or increases in perfusate NaCN concentration. Lung energy state was assessed by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or measurement of adenine nucleotides by high-pressure liquid chromatography in freeze-clamped biopsies. In ventilated lungs, inspired PO2 of 200 (normoxia), 50 (hypoxia), and 0 Torr (anoxia) did not change adenine nucleotides but resulted in steady-state pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) values of 15.5 +/- 1.4, 30.3 +/- 1.8, and 17.2 +/- 1.9 mmHg, respectively, indicating vasoconstriction during hypoxia and reversal of vasoconstriction during anoxia. In degassed lungs, similar changes in Ppa were observed; however, energy state deteriorated during anoxia. An increase in perfusate NaCN concentration from 0 to 0.1 mM progressively increased Ppa and did not alter adenine nucleotides, whereas 1 mM reversed this vasoconstriction and caused deterioration of energy state. These results suggest that 1) pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to hypoxia or cyanide occurred independently of whole lung energy state, 2) the inability of the pulmonary vasculature to sustain hypoxic vasoconstriction during anoxia might be associated with decreased energy state in some lung compartment, and 3) atelectasis was detrimental to whole lung energy state. \nEffect of early programmes of high and low intensity exercise on physical performance after transmural acute myocardial infarction. Does a programme of light exercise training after acute myocardial infarction produce the same improvement in treadmill performance as aerobic exercise training? Three hundred and eight men from a consecutive series of 479 men with transmural (Q wave) acute myocardial infarction, admitted to a single coronary care unit, were randomly allocated to eight weeks of group aerobic exercise training or group light exercise. Groups were well matched for all characteristics other than site of infarction, which did not significantly affect results. Mean (SD) physical working capacity (metabolic equivalents) determined by treadmill testing at the start of the study (in the third week after infarction) was 6.8 (2.2) v 6.7 (2.5) METs, at the end (in the eleventh week after infarction) 10.8 (2.3) v 9.9 (2.4) METs, and at 12 month review 10.8 (2.4) v 10.7 (1.9) METs for the exercise training group and the light exercise group respectively. The difference of 0.9 METs at the end of the study was the only significant difference between groups. There were no significant intergroup differences at any stage in resting and maximal heart rate, resting and maximal systolic blood pressure, or rate-pressure product. Apart from a small temporarily greater physical working capacity, the physical benefits of aerobic exercise training were equally well achieved by group light exercise. \nHigh nocturnal body temperature in premenstrual syndrome and late luteal phase dysphoric disorder. OBJECTIVE: Because women with late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD) experience symptomatic affective states predictably, they can be studied to determine whether there are biological findings related solely to the clinically symptomatic state. The authors sought to answer the question, Does body temperature change with affective state? METHOD: The core body temperature and motor activity patterns of 10 women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), six of whom also met criteria for LLPDD, and no other psychological or medical illness were compared to those of six women with chronic, noncyclic dysphoria and six asymptomatic comparison women at four phases of the menstrual cycle. RESULTS: The nocturnal temperatures of the women with PMS/LLPDD were significantly higher than those of the comparison subjects across the entire menstrual cycle, but there were no differences in nocturnal activity levels. The women with noncyclic dysphoria had a mean nocturnal temperature in the follicular phase as high as that of the women with PMS/LLPDD. The temperatures of all women were higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in the future investigators should document menstrual cycle phase in all female subjects and, when studying body temperature, should carefully monitor symptomatic state in comparison subjects. \nParticular HLA-DQ alpha beta heterodimer associated with IDDM susceptibility in both DR4-DQw4 Japanese and DR4-DQw8/DRw8-DQw4 whites. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) susceptibility is associated with the DR4-DQw4 haplotype in Japanese and the DR4-DQw8/-Drw8-DQw4 genotype (among others) in whites. We investigated whether these Japanese and white individuals encode the same or a similar DQ alpha beta heterodimer, which may be an IDDM-susceptibility molecule in both populations. First, we carried out genomic DQA1 and DQB1 typing with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. The results revealed that Japanese DR4-DQw4 and white DR4-DQw8/DRw8-DQw4 IDDM patients carried the DQA1*0301 allele and the DQB1*0401 or DQB1*0402 allele, either in the cis (Japanese DR4-DQw4 individuals) or trans (white DR4-DQw8/DRw8-DQw4 individuals) position. Because the DQB1*0401 and DQB1*0402 alleles differ only at residue 23, these DQB1 genes are very similar. We next tested cells from these individuals with a particular DQ-specific T-lymphocyte clone, HH58. The clone was only restimulated with cells from Japanese individuals who carried the DQA1*0301 and DQB1*0401 alleles in the cis position or white individuals who carried the DQA1*0301 and DQB1*0402 alleles in the trans position. Thus, particular cis- or trans-encoded DQ alpha beta heterodimers, which in both cases are recognized by T lymphocytes, may confer susceptibility to IDDM in both ethnic groups. \nEndoscopic treatment by snare electrocoagulation prior to Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation in 85 voluminous colorectal villous adenomas. The association of endoscopic resection with Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation was used to treat benign colorectal villous adenomas. Eight-five patients were included: 49 with surgical contraindications, 35 for whom surgical resection appeared to be too hazardous, and 1 who refused surgery. Forty-five tumors had an axial extension between 1 and 3 cm, and 40 tumors had an axial extension of at least 4 cm. Diathermic snare resection was performed to remove large tumoral fragments prior to laser photocoagulation of the residual flat lesions. Treatments were repeated every 15 days until total tumor destruction was achieved. A carcinoma was detected in biopsy specimens obtained during endoscopic treatment of five patients. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Treatment results could be analyzed in 78 patients. Successful treatment was achieved in 67 patients. Tumor destruction was complete in 77 percent of patients who had lesions of at least 4 cm diameter and in 93 percent of patients with smaller lesions. The axial extension of the tumor was the main factor affecting the results of treatment. No major complications occurred. During the average 103-week follow-up period, 21 percent of the patients with total tumor destruction had a recurrence. The risk of recurrence was correlated with the number of initial treatment sessions and previous surgery treatment. It would appear that the treatment with endoscopic resection prior to Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation is a safe and effective method in the destruction of colorectal villous adenomas. \nReference systems in echocardiographic quantitative wall motion analysis with registration of respiration. Registration of respiration allows analysis at the end-expiratory phase and may thus favor the use of the fixed-reference system versus the floating-reference system in echocardiographic quantitative wall motion analysis. Analysis is performed on two-dimensional echocardiograms of 44 normal subjects, 38 patients with anterior myocardial infarction, and 17 patients with posterior myocardial infarction. Two different models for wall motion analysis are applied, each using the fixed-reference system and the floating-reference system, respectively. In patients with anterior myocardial infarction, the fixed-reference system indicates severe wall motion abnormalities at the anterior, septal, and apical walls, whereas the floating-reference system indicates less severe wall motion abnormalities almost equally at every wall. In patients with posterior myocardial infarction, the fixed-reference system indicates severe wall motion abnormalities at the posterior wall, whereas the floating-reference system indicates less severe wall motion abnormalities almost equally at every wall. These findings indicate that the fixed-reference system is superior to the floating-reference system in quantification of wall motion of end-expiratory two-dimensional echocardiograms. \nComparison of speed of onset of analgesic effect of diamorphine and morphine. In a random, double-blind crossover trial using an ischaemic limb pain model we have assessed the speed of onset of analgesia after an i.v. bolus of equipotent doses of diamorphine and morphine in 12 healthy male volunteers. Pain and its subsequent relief were assessed by means of a visual analogue scale. Two of the subjects found diamorphine acted quicker than morphine, one found no difference and nine found that morphine was quicker than diamorphine. The mean time to diamorphine effect was 53% greater than for morphine (P less than 0.005, Wilcoxon rank sum test). These findings suggest that, for rapid relief of pain, morphine is more suitable than diamorphine. \nNew autonomic and sensory neuropathy with loss of adrenergic sympathetic function and sensory neuropeptides. A 30-year-old woman with longstanding dizziness was found to have a severe postural fall in blood pressure and a reduced skin axon-reflex flare response. Autonomic tests indicated selective impairment of adrenergic sympathetic function. Plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, and dopamine beta hydroxylase were undetectable. Skin biopsy specimens showed loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y (markers of adrenergic sympathetic fibres) and of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (sensory neuropeptides). A sural nerve biopsy specimen showed severe depletion of unmyelinated fibres. The constellation of losses were compatible with nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation, which was confirmed on assay. This new syndrome may be explained by loss of trophic action of NGF. \nLeft ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension. Major advances in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertension have occurred in recent years. The ability to diagnose LVH has been improved by echocardiography, and with this technique it has been shown that evidence of LVH is an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The major cause of death in patients with hypertension and LVH is coronary artery disease. Therefore an understanding of the interrelationships between these two disorders is fundamental, and it is now clear that the hypertrophied ventricle is vulnerable to myocardial ischemia. Appreciation of the mechanisms of sudden death has also increased, although the exact situation in patients with LVH remains to be clarified. Regression of LVH is known to occur with the use of several different antihypertensive drugs. Recent studies indicate that the calcium blocking agent nicardipine, in addition to beta-blocking drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, brings about LVH regression without any deterioration of left ventricular function. However, further studies are needed to assess the long-term benefits of this regression. \nCompartment syndrome of the thigh with osteogenesis imperfecta. A case report. Compartment syndrome of the thigh has been sporadically reported in the orthopedic literature. A 27-year-old man with osteogenesis imperfecta sustained a femoral fracture with relatively minor trauma and subsequently developed compartment syndrome of the thigh. Fat embolism syndrome and hyperplastic callus developed postoperatively. \nRegression of hepatic metastases from gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma after hepatic arterial chemoembolization. Two patients with gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma metastatic to the liver were treated by hepatic chemoembolization with cisplatin and polyvinyl sponge followed by hepatic arterial infusion of vinblastine. Effective palliation in terms of durable tumor regression was achieved in both patients after two chemoembolization-infusion procedures. These results suggest that regional therapy may offer new hope for the subset of sarcoma patients who have liver metastases resistant to combination systemic chemotherapy. \nThe Damus-Fontan procedure. The Damus-Kaye-Stansel operation is a useful technique for the treatment of complex cyanotic congenital heart disease when there is obstruction between the systemic ventricle and the aorta. Modifications of the technique include transection of the aorta and the pulmonary artery, anastomosis of the contiguous aortic and pulmonary walls, and connection of the distal aorta to the perimeter of the new bivalved proximal great artery. In addition, the bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt technique can be used with or without the Fontan procedure. Six patients underwent a Damus-Fontan operation, and all survived. Two patients underwent the Damus-cavopulmonary shunt (hemi-Fontan) procedure, and 1 survived. The postoperative status of the 7 survivors is good to excellent. Follow-up ranges from 2 months to 7 1/2 years. \nAnastomotic obstruction after stapled enteroanastomosis. We have recently treated two cases of anastomotic obstruction after side-to-side stapled enteroanastomosis. Complete obstruction of a stapled small-bowel anastomosis has not been reported to our knowledge. The mechanism of the obstruction appears to be the healing together of the cut edges of viable bowel beyond the inverted stapled lines. An alternative method of constructing the functional end-to-end enteroanastomosis that is offered is intended to prevent the occurrence of postoperative anastomotic obstruction. \nEpidemiologic aspects of shigellosis and other causes of dysentery in Thailand. Nearly 20% of children seen in the outpatient department of Children's Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, for diarrheal disease had bloody diarrhea. Shigella species and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli--isolated from 13% and 2% of children with diarrhea, respectively--were the most frequent causes of bloody diarrhea. Campylobacter species and nontyphoidal Salmonella species were also isolated frequently but were much less often associated with bloody diarrhea. Shigella species were rarely isolated from patients who did not have diarrhea, while Campylobacter and Salmonella species were isolated frequently from well children. None of the species isolated always caused bloody diarrhea. Studies on infection with Campylobacter suggest that natural immunity may prevent bloody diarrhea and in fact may eventually prevent all disease due to this organism. Studies of endemic Shigella flexneri and epidemic Shigella dysenteriae 1 in Thailand have shown that immunity may also explain an age-related decrease in rates of S. flexneri infection but not in rates of S. dysenteriae 1 isolation. \nCerebrovascular disease in hypertensive blacks. There is convincing evidence that all grades of persistent diastolic hypertension, especially in blacks, should be treated in order to prevent stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Studies are now in progress to gather additional information concerning isolated systolic hypertension, especially in the aged. Inasmuch as at least one half or more of stroke deaths in blacks develop as the result of hypertension, lowering blood pressure offers the perfect opportunity to reduce considerably the frequency of this devastating illness. The recent dramatic fall in U.S. stroke mortality, greatest in the black female, is a commendable achievement, but the flattening of the declining mortality curve over the past several years should be a cause for alarm and intensive investigation. \nGastrointestinal lipomas: a radiologic and pathologic review. Lipomas of the gastrointestinal tract are an infrequent finding on radiologic examination; however, they occur often enough to warrant consideration in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the gut. In many instances, their morphologic characteristics allow the specific diagnosis of a lipoma. In this report, we review gastrointestinal lipomas with an emphasis on their radiologic and pathologic correlation. \nSpectrum of orthostatic disorders: classification based on an analysis of the short-term circulatory response upon standing. 1. In 31 consecutively referred patients (20 females, 11 males) with overt or suspected orthostatic disorders, the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that occur in the first 2 min of standing were analysed. 2. Blood pressure was measured continuously by Finapres. The blood pressure and heart rate responses after 1-2 min of standing (early steady-state response) were used to classify the patients as follows: group I (n = 17, age 42 +/- 17 years), normal early steady-state blood pressure and heart rate responses; group II (n = 5, age 40 +/- 14 years), combination of normal early steady-state blood pressure and postural tachycardia; group III (n = 9, age 51 +/- 14 years), hypotensive orthostatic response with (4/9) or without (5/9) postural tachycardia. We examined whether additional information could be obtained by beat-to-beat analysis of the initial circulatory response (first 30 s). It was quantified by identifying the blood pressure trough and overshoot and the maximum heart rate and relative bradycardia. 3. The initial drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not differ between the three groups. A recovery of blood pressure with a systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure overshoot was present in all group I and II patients, but was absent in all except two patients in group III. The initial maximum heart rate increase did not differ between the three groups. The relative bradycardia was less in groups II and III than in group I. 4. We conclude that analysis of the beat-to-beat blood pressure changes in the first 30 s after the onset of standing provides almost all the information that is necessary to determine abnormalities in orthostatic circulatory control. \nDoes atrial appendectomy aggravate secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide? The present study was designed to clarify how atrial appendectomy affects hemodynamics and secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide in the failing heart. Eleven mongrel dogs were prepared for the experimental model of high-output heart failure by creation of arteriovenous fistulas between femoral arteries and veins. Two months after the first operation, effects of bilateral atrial appendectomies on basal and pacing-induced secretions of atrial natriuretic polypeptide were investigated in five dogs with simultaneous measurement of various hemodynamic indices. In the remaining six dogs, used as a control group, pacing-induced secretion of atrial natriuretic polypeptide was examined in the same way as in the appendectomy group. After excision of the atrial appendages, neither systolic blood pressure nor either atrial pressure changed, but plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide level was decreased (292 +/- 54 to 188 +/- 47 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and cardiac output fell (3.7 +/- 0.9 to 3.0 +/- 0.8 L/min, p less than 0.01). During pacing-induced tachycardia, the peak level of plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide was lower in the appendectomy group than in the control groups (593 +/- 213 versus 1170 +/- 324 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), despite similar left atrial pressures in the two groups. The excised appendages contained approximately 30% of the total amount of atrial natriuretic polypeptide. These results demonstrate that atrial appendectomy decreases secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide and reduces cardiac output in dogs with experimental high-output heart failure. \nSystemic contact dermatitis from pseudoephedrine. A patient with rhinitis developed systemic contact dermatitis when starting oral treatment with Rhinalair, containing pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. A few months later, another oral treatment Rinutan, containing norephedrine hydrochloride, provoked a more severe generalized eczema. Patch test reactions were strongly positive to ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, slightly positive to phenylephrine and negative to epinephrine. Norephedrine was not tested. \nColorectal surgery: short-term prophylaxis with clindamycin plus aztreonam or gentamicin. A randomized study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of aztreonam plus clindamycin with that of gentamicin plus clindamycin for prophylaxis of infection following colorectal surgery. A total of 138 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were randomized to treatment with clindamycin (600 mg) plus either aztreonam (1 g) or gentamicin (80 mg) 30 minutes before and 8 and 16 hours after surgery. The study included 122 patients (88.4%) with colorectal carcinoma. Samples from the abdominal cavity and from the subcutaneous tissues were taken for bacteriologic study. All samples from the abdominal cavity yielded microorganisms; both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated. Wound infections occurred in eight patients (12.1%) in the aztreonam group and in 12 patients (16.7%) in the gentamicin group. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, enterococci, and staphylococci were isolated most frequently from wounds and were often isolated from bacteriologic samples from the abdominal cavity of the same patients. The incidence of septic complications reflected the extent of nutritional and immunologic impairment. No significant differences were found between groups in the rate of urinary tract or lower respiratory tract infections. Aztreonam/clindamycin appears to be a valid alternative to gentamicin/clindamycin for the prophylaxis of infections following colorectal surgery. \nIncidence and management of airway problems in the CHARGE Association. The airway problems associated with anaesthesia in patients with the CHARGE Association have been underreported. We undertook a retrospective review of 50 cases, of which anaesthetic records were available for 37 patients. Apart from choanal atresia and cleft lip and palate, 56% of patients has some other upper airway abnormality. There appeared to be greater difficulty in tracheal intubation with increase in age in four patients. The incidence and management of airway abnormalities are discussed. \nReport of a hidden case of overfeeding. Nutritional support is essential to the care of the critically ill patient, but complications of overfeeding can occur. Precise metabolic measurement by indirect calorimetry can detect problems of nutrition and allow adjustment in caloric intake. This case study illustrates the complications of carbon dioxide retention and inability to wean from mechanical ventilation with subsequent prevention of further complications. \nFailure of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy in experimental enterococcal endocarditis. To assess the potential efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) against serious enterococcal infections, we used a rat enterococcal endocarditis model comparing TMP-SMX therapy (500 mg of TMP plus 2,500 mg of SMX per kg of body weight per day given every 8 h by intragastric gavage) with intravenous ampicillin therapy (1,000 mg/kg per day). Despite concentrations of active drug in serum well in excess of the MIC and MBC, the mean residual vegetation bacterial titer in TMP-SMX-treated rats was similar to that in untreated controls (8.4 +/- 1.1 versus 8.6 +/- 1.3 log10 CFU/g) and significantly higher than that in the ampicillin-treated group (3.6 +/- 1.5 log10 CFU/g; P less than or equal to 0.001). This demonstrates discordance between in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of TMP-SMX in serious enterococcal infection. \nIdentification of a germ-line mutation in the p53 gene in a patient with an intracranial ependymoma. We detected a germ-line mutation of the p53 gene in a patient with a malignant ependymoma of the posterior fossa. This mutation, which was found at codon 242, resulted in an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved site of exon 7 of the p53 gene; the same mutation was found in both the germ-line and the tumor tissue. This is the most common region of previously described somatic p53 mutations in tumor specimens and of the germ-line p53 mutations in patients with the Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome. Evaluation of the patient's family revealed several direct maternal and paternal relatives who had died at a young age from different types of cancer. The association of a germ-line p53 mutation with an intracranial malignancy and a strong family history of cancer suggests that p53 gene mutations predispose a person to malignancy and, like retinoblastoma mutations, may be inherited. \nLate potentials on signal-averaged electrocardiograms and patency of the infarct-related artery in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. This study evaluated the relation between patency of the infarct-related artery and the presence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) in 124 consecutive patients (98 men, 26 women; mean age 59 years) with acute myocardial infarction receiving thrombolytic therapy, acute percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or standard care. All patients were studied by coronary angiography, measurement of ejection fraction and signal-averaged ECG. The infarct-related artery was closed in 51 patients and open in 73. Among patients with no prior myocardial infarction undergoing early attempted reperfusion therapy, a patent artery was associated with a decreased incidence of late potentials (20% versus 71%; no significant difference in ejection fraction). In the 48 patients receiving thrombolytic agents within 4 h of symptom onset, the incidence of late potentials was 24% and 83% among patients with an open or closed artery, respectively (p less than 0.04). The most powerful predictors of late potentials were the presence of a closed infarct-related artery, followed by prior infarction and patient age. Among patients receiving thrombolytic agents within 4 h of symptom onset, the only variable that was predictive of the presence of late potentials was a closed infarct-related artery. These data imply that reperfusion of an infarct-related artery has a beneficial effect on the electrophysiologic substrate for serious ventricular arrhythmias that is independent of change in left ventricular ejection fraction as an index of infarct size. These findings might explain, in part, the low late mortality rate in survivors of myocardial infarction with documented reperfusion of the infarct-related artery. \nSerum inhibin levels in polycystic ovary syndrome: effect of insulin resistance and insulin secretion. Insulin resistance is common in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. We investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and the serum inhibin concentration in a group of 19 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and eight control subjects at different phases of the menstrual cycle. Insulin resistance was measured by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and inhibin was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. Insulin sensitivity (mean +/- SE) was significantly reduced in the polycystic ovary syndrome group compared with controls: reduced insulin sensitivity 46.7 +/- 5.0 min-1/(nmol/mL), normally insulin-sensitive 106.6 +/- 11.7 min-1/(nmol/mL) (P less than .01). The women with polycystic ovary syndrome had inhibin levels (126 +/- 15.2 microLEq/mL) comparable to those found during the early follicular phase of the control group (117 +/- 22.1 microLEq/mL), but significantly lower than late follicular phase (259 +/- 25.6 microLEq/mL) or luteal phase (448 +/- 91.8 microLEq/mL) levels in the control group. No association was found between the degree of insulin resistance and the inhibin concentration, which remained unaltered over a 3-hour period despite maximal stimulation of endogenous insulin secretion. The inhibin concentrations in polycystic ovary syndrome may reflect impaired follicular maturation. Inhibin secretion is not acutely affected by insulin secretion in normal or in hyperandrogenic women. \nAbsence of human papilloma virus in cervical adenocarcinoma determined by in situ hybridisation. A few studies using DNA technology have suggested that human papillomavirus (HPV) may be an aetiological factor for adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. Twenty one cases of cervical adenocarcinoma were studied by in situ hybridisation using biotinylated DNA probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and a streptavidin, biotinylated alkaline phosphatase detection system. Intranuclear HPV DNA was detected in none of the adenocarcinomas, while positive controls gave a clear intranuclear signal. Adjacent areas of normal, koilocytic, and dysplastic squamous epithelium also gave positive results. It may be that squamous epithelium contaminates adenocarcinomas reported as positive by Southern blotting. Our results showing absence of detectable HPV DNA within adenocarcinomas suggest that HPV infection may not have a major role in the aetiology of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. \nTreatment with pulsatile luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone modulates folliculogenesis in response to ovarian stimulation with exogenous gonadotropins in patients with polycystic ovaries. Combined treatment with pulsatile LH-RH and hMG, given to eight patients who had anovulation associated with PCO and resistant to CC, significantly reduced the number of large follicles induced by hMG alone. A direct effect of pulsatile LH-RH on the ovary is postulated. This combined treatment eased the problems of multifollicular development, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing complications in patients with PCO stimulated by gonadotropins. \nFirst clinical study of the selective 5-HT3 antagonist, granisetron (BRL 43694), in the acute treatment of migraine headache. Granisetron (BRL 43694), a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, was assessed as acute therapy for the first time in migraine patients. In an open pilot study 7 migraine attacks were treated in 6 patients. All but 1 patient experienced marked and rapid relief from the headache, and nausea and vomiting were rapidly resolved in the 6 cases where these symptoms accompanied the attack. No side effects were recorded. Development of granisetron for migraine was suspended during the study for extraneous reasons. \nExpression of Tn, sialosyl Tn, and T antigens in human pancreas. Carbohydrate antigens representing some of the initial steps in mucin O-linked glycosylation were examined in specimens of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tn antigen, recognized by Vicia villosa lectin, was expressed by all specimens of normal pancreas (acinar cells) and pancreatic cancers and all but one case of chronic pancreatitis. Sialosyl Tn antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody TKH2, was expressed in a cancer-associated fashion, being completely absent in normal pancreas but expressed by 56% of chronic pancreatitis and 97% of pancreatic cancers. T antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody AH9-16, was expressed in 68% of normal pancreas (acinar cells), 67% of chronic pancreatitis, and 48% of pancreatic cancer tissues. These results indicate that normal acinar cells of the pancreas are capable of expressing selected carbohydrate structures associated with the initial steps of mucin glycosylation. The marked expression of sialosyl Tn compared with T antigen in pancreatic cancers suggests that with malignant transformation there is selective usage of glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in mucin oligosaccharide synthesis. \nQTc prolongation measured by standard 12-lead electrocardiography is an independent risk factor for sudden death due to cardiac arrest. BACKGROUND. QTc prolongation has been implicated as a risk factor for sudden death; however, a controversy exists over its significance. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the Rotterdam QT Project, 6,693 consecutive patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were followed up for 2 years; of these, 245 patients died suddenly. A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and clinical data at the time of 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography were collected for all patients who died suddenly and for a random sample of 467 patients from the study cohort. In all patients without an intraventricular conduction defect (176 patients who died suddenly and 390 patients from the sample), QT interval duration was measured in leads I, II, and III and corrected for heart rate with Bazett's formula (QTc). In patients without evidence of cardiac dysfunction (history of symptoms of pump failure or an ejection fraction less than 40%), QTc of more than 440 msec was associated with a 2.3 times higher risk for sudden death compared with a QTc of 440 msec or less (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.9). In contrast, in patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction, the relative risk of QTc prolongation was 1.0 (0.5, 1.9). Adjustment for age, gender, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and the use of drugs did not alter these relative risks. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that in patients without intraventricular conduction defects and cardiac dysfunction, QTc prolongation measured from the standard electrocardiogram is a risk factor for sudden death independent of age, history of myocardial infarction, heart rate, and drug use. In patients with cardiac dysfunction, QTc duration is not related to the risk for sudden death. \nRisk of adverse events in children completing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: St. Jude Total Therapy studies VIII, IX, and X. We studied the frequency, causes, and predictors of adverse events in 624 patients who had completed treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in three consecutive total therapy studies (VII, IX, and X, 1972 to 1983). Event-free survival in study X was significantly better overall than that in studies VIII and IX (P less than .0001 by the log-rank test). In study X, 75% of the patients were electively taken off therapy, compared with 54% in studies VIII and IX. However, the risks of having an adverse event during the first 5 years after completion of therapy were remarkably similar: 22% (95% confidence interval, 17% to 29%) in study X versus 24% (20% to 29%) in studies VIII and IX. Bone marrow, testicular, and CNS relapses accounted for the majority of failures in both groups (85% in study X and 92% in studies VIII and IX). Late adverse events consisted largely of hematologic relapses and the development of solid tumors. Black race (P = .001) and leukemia without an anterior mediastinal mass (P = .05) were associated with an increased risk of failure after completion of treatment in the two earlier clinical trials, whereas a lower leukemic cell DNA content (DNA index less than 1.16) was the only predictor of late treatment failure in the more recent trial (P = .019). None of the other presenting features that were examined (eg, age, leukocyte count, and sex) had value as predictors of late failure. Thus, improved treatment altered the impact of specific prognostic factors and the distribution of sites of relapse, but it did not significantly affect the risk of delayed failure. \nAn educational device for Mohs micrographic surgery. A three-dimensional model of basal cell carcinoma. Mohs micrographic surgery for skin cancer (fresh-tissue technique) involves the processing of tissue in a complex fashion. The advantages of this method relate to the asymmetric three-dimensional growth of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). A device is described here based on published knowledge about the growth of BCC. The model demonstrates the precise way in which Mohs surgery varies from other surgical approaches to yield higher cure rates in specific circumstances. This device may be helpful in educating residents and medical students about Mohs surgery and in preparing patients for this procedure. \nIschemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus after aorto-iliac reconstruction. Between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1989, 9 patients (6 males and 3 females) developed ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus following 3,320 operations on the abdominal aorta (0.3%). The incidence of this complication was 0.1% (2 of 1,901) after elective and 1.4% (3 of 210) after emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 0.3% (4 of 1,209) after repair for occlusive disease. Three of the latter had prior clinical evidence of distal embolization. Eight grafts were bifurcated (aorto-iliac:four, aorto-femoral: three, aorto-ilio-femoral:one). One patient underwent extra-anatomic revascularization. Only two patients had supraceliac aortic cross-clamping and one patient underwent exclusion of both internal iliac arteries. Four patients had hypotension. Early mortality was 22% (two of nine). Severe perioperative complications, mostly due to associated visceral and somatic ischemia and sepsis, were present in seven of the nine patients. The extent and type of the neurologic injury correlated with long-term outcome. Patients with ischemic injury of the lumbosacral roots or plexus had better recovery. Attention to the pelvic circulation and the collateral blood supply is important. Use of gentle technique to prevent embolization, avoidance of hypotension and prolonged supraceliac cross-clamping, revascularization of at least one internal iliac artery, and the use of heparin may decrease but not eliminate paraplegia. Once this unexpected complication occurs, careful neurologic evaluation should be done to localize the lesion and aid prognosis. \nAgrobacterium radiobacter peritonitis in two patients maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis. We report two patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis who developed peritonitis in which the infecting organism was Agrobacterium radiobacter, normally a rare pathogen in humans. Both patients initially responded to antibiotics, but later relapsed and required catheter removal. Neither had been exposed to soil or plant material. A radiobacter is yet another of a growing list of unusual organisms that infect the peritoneal cavity of peritoneal dialysis patients. \nModulating effects of calcium in animal models of colon carcinogenesis and short-term studies in subjects at increased risk for colon cancer. A substantive amount of evidence from animal models supports the hypothesis that dietary fat is an etiological factor in colon cancer. Although various theories account for possible mechanisms, it is clear that under the influence of a basic colonic pH, fatty acids and bile acids may become highly surfactant in the colon, causing cell loss and compensatory hyperproliferation. Calcium likely reduces lipid damage in the colon by complexing with fat to form mineral-fat complexes or soaps. It has been shown in an increasing number of animal experiments that calcium has the ability to inhibit colon cancer. In limited studies in man, the colonic hyperproliferation associated with increased risk for colon cancer has been reversed for short periods by administration of supplemental dietary calcium. Taken together the available evidence suggests that increases in the daily intake of calcium in the diet may provide a means of colorectal-cancer control. \nCavernous malformations of the brain stem. Once they become symptomatic, cavernous malformations of the brain stem appear to cause progressive morbidity from repetitive hemorrhage, and can even be fatal. Twenty-four patients with long-tract and/or cranial nerve findings from their cavernous malformations of the brain stem were seen for initial evaluation or surgical consultation and thereafter received either surgical or continued conservative treatment. The decision to operate was based on the proximity of the cavernous malformation to the pial surface of the brain stem, the patient's neurological status, and the number of symptomatic episodes. Sixteen patients were treated by definitive surgery directed at excision of their malformation. In four patients, associated venous malformations influenced the surgical approach and their recognition avoided the risk of inappropriate excision of the venous malformation. Although some of the 16 patients had transient, immediate, postoperative worsening of their neurological deficits, the outcome of all except one was the same or improved. Only one patient developed recurrent symptoms: a new deficit 2 1/2 years after surgery required reoperation after regrowth of the cavernous malformation. She has been neurologically stable since the second surgery. One patient died 6 months postoperatively from a shunt infection and sepsis. The eight conservatively treated patients are followed with annual magnetic resonance imaging studies. One has a dramatic associated venous malformation. Seven patients have either minor intermittent or no symptoms, and the eighth died from a hemorrhage 1 year after his initial presentation. Based on these results, surgical extirpation of symptomatic cavernous malformations of the brain stem appears to be the treatment of choice when a patient is symptomatic, the lesion is located superficially, and an operative approach can spare eloquent tissue. When cavernous malformations of the brain stem are completely excised, cure appears permanent. \nA t(4;22) in a meningioma points to the localization of a putative tumor-suppressor gene. Cytogenetic analysis of meningioma cells from one particular patient (MN32) displayed the stem-line karyo-type 45, XY, -1, 4p+, 22q-, 22q+, which thus had rearrangements of both chromosomes 22. The 22q+ marker appeared as a dicentric: 22 pter----q11::1p11----qter. The reciprocal product of this translocation has presumably been lost because it lacked a centromere. The 22q- chromosome also appeared to have lost sequences distal to band q11. We assumed that this marker could have been the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 4 and 22. To investigate the 4p+ and 22q- chromosomes in more detail, human-hamster somatic cell hybrids were constructed that segregated the 22q- and 4p+ chromosomes. Southern blot analysis with DNA from these hybrids showed that sequences from 22q were indeed translocated to 4p+ and that reciprocally sequences from 4p were translocated to 22q-, demonstrating a balanced t(4;22)(p16;q11). On the basis of these results we presume that in this tumor a tumor-suppressor gene is deleted in the case of the 22q+ marker and that the t(4;22) disrupts the second allele of this gene. The latter translocation was mapped between D22S1 and D22S15, a distance of 1 cM on the linkage map of this chromosome. The area in which we have located the translocation is within the region where the gene predisposing to neurofibromatosis 2 has been mapped. \nThe rapid and reversible activation of a calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 during myocardial ischemia. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of two members of a novel family of calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipases A2 in mammalian myocardium (Wolf, R. A., and R. W. Gross. 1985. J. Biol. Chem. 260:7295-7303; and Hazen, S. L., D. A. Ford, and R. W. Gross. 1991. J. Biol. Chem. 266:5629-5633). To examine the potential role of these calcium-independent phospholipases A2 in mediating membrane dysfunction during early myocardial ischemia, the temporal course of alterations in phospholipase A2 activity during global ischemia in Langendorf perfused rabbit hearts was quantified and compared with traditionally accepted markers of myocytic ischemic injury and anaerobic metabolism. We now report that membrane-associated calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 activity increased over 400% during 2 min of global ischemia (P less than 0.01), was near maximally activated (greater than 10-fold) after only 5 min of ischemia, and remained activated throughout the entire ischemic interval examined (2-60 min). Activation of membrane-associated plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 after 5 min of myocardial ischemia was rapidly reversible during reperfusion of ischemic tissue. Both the activation of phospholipase A2 and its reversibility during reperfusion were temporally correlated to alterations in myocytic anaerobic metabolism. Furthermore, activation of membrane-associated phospholipase A2 was essentially complete before electron microscopic evidence of cellular damage. Collectively, these results identify dynamic alterations in calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 activity during myocardial ischemia which precede irreversible cellular injury and demonstrate that activation of plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 is amongst the earliest biochemical alterations in ischemic myocardium. \nReproducibility of quantitative planar thallium-201 scintigraphy: quantitative criteria for reversibility of myocardial perfusion defects. Fifty-two paired stress/delayed planar 201TI studies (27 exercise studies, 25 dipyridamole studies) were processed twice by seven technologists to assess inter- and intraobserver variability. The reproducibility was inversely related to the size of 201TI perfusion abnormalities. Intraobserver variability was not different between exercise and dipyridamole studies for lesions of similar size. Based upon intraobserver variability, objective quantitative criteria for reversibility of perfusion abnormalities were defined. These objective criteria were tested prospectively in a separate group of 35 201TI studies and compared with the subjective interpretation of quantitative circumferential profiles. Overall, exact agreement existed in 78% of images (kappa statistic k = 0.66). We conclude that quantification of planar 201TI scans is highly reproducible, with acceptable inter- and intraobserver variability. Objective criteria for lesion reversibility correlated well with analysis by experienced observers. \nDelays in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction: an overview. Delays in treatment of acute myocardial infarction prevent a substantial portion of patients from receiving maximal benefit from reperfusion therapy. Median delay between onset of symptoms and arrival at the hospital is 2 to 4 hours. Average time between arrival at the hospital and initiation of thrombolytic therapy is 84 minutes. Approximately 50% of patients hospitalized for suspected acute myocardial infarction do not use the emergency medical service system. Delay before treatment can be divided into several components: patient delay, emergency medical service delay, and hospital delay. Factors contributing to delay in each component and possible approaches to decreasing these delays are discussed. The effects of treatment delay on prognosis and future care-seeking behavior of patients hospitalized with suspected acute myocardial infarction are also discussed. \nNa,K-ATPase in isolated nephron segments in rats with experimental heart failure. To characterize renal transport of Na+ in heart failure, urinary Na+ excretion (UNaV), aldosterone levels, and Na,K-ATPase activity in isolated nephron segments were determined in three groups: control rats, rats with heart failure and moderate sodium retention, and rats with heart failure and severe sodium retention. Heart failure was induced by a fistula between the aorta and vena cava. For the control group, UNaV was 0.66 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- SEM) mueq/min, and aldosterone was 18.4 +/- 3.5 ng%. Na,K-ATPase activity (in 10(-11) mol/mm/min) was 28.4 +/- 1.1 in the proximal convoluted tubule, 23.3 +/- 1.0 in the proximal straight tubule, 37.4 +/- 1.9 in the medullary thick ascending limb, 40.2 +/- 1.9 in the cortical thick ascending limb, 43.2 +/- 2.2 in the distal convoluted tubule, and 20.5 +/- 0.9 in the cortical collecting duct. For the group with moderate heart failure, UNaV was 0.35 +/- 0.02 (p less than 0.001 versus control), and aldosterone was 15.9 +/- 4.4 (p = NS versus control). Na,K-ATPase activity was unchanged in the proximal convoluted tubule, proximal straight tubule, medullary thick ascending limb, and cortical collecting duct, but it increased in the cortical thick ascending limb to 57.7 +/- 3.1 (p less than 0.001 versus control) and decreased in the distal convoluted tubule to 35.3 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.005 versus control). For the group with severe heart failure, UNaV was 0.029 +/- 0.016 (p less than 0.001 versus control), and aldosterone was 186.0 +/- 14.8 (p less than 0.001 versus control). \nThe prognosis of Hodgkin's disease in older adults. This investigation was undertaken to assess the apparent poor survival of older patients with Hodgkin's disease. The clinical course of Hodgkin's disease in 136 patients, 60 to 79 years of age, was compared with that of 223 patients, 40 to 59 years of age. The patients registered from November 1977 through ",
